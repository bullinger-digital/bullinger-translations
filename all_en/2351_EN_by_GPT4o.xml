      <p>Greetings. What has been obtained by our envoys in Zürich and elsewhere, I do not yet know, since this matter is only being discussed today before the dioceses, as I suppose. Would that our magistrates agreed more rightly in all things. There was also a certain dispute with the Genevans, a significant part of which was the diversity of ceremonies; but in these days it has also been settled by the grace of the Lord. The arbiter of Basel in the Orbe case has given a verdict in our favor. Therefore, nothing remains except that, with prayers collected, the Mass is driven out of Orbe, for which we give thanks to the Lord and continually pray for the increase of His church. Would that the same happiness and freedom might befall the people of Locarno!</p>
      <p>From France, we have nothing except that the king's envoy wrote here in these days that the king on the 9th of this month captured a certain notable city in Picardy not far from Namur and killed all the men found there, and there is hope that Namur itself will also be captured. The king himself is in arms with a very well-equipped army, and everything is succeeding for him. But the French are accustomed to boast of their own in this way.</p>
      <p>The Emperor, in the old manner, breaks the attack of the French with patience and overcomes with cunning. The Burgundians report that they are asking the Swiss to take them under their protection; for they fear the French.</p>
      <p>But how certain this is, I do not know.</p>
      <p>With us, everything is quite well, except that Emanuel has been taken from us again; for it seemed to our people that he could act more conveniently in Lausanne than here. Thus, whatever we attempt, our soil does not seem to be willing to be fertile for letters at all.</p>
      <p>Most people breathe arms and broad commands, not letters, although no greater ornament could be added to such a great command (not to mention the utility) than the abundance of learned men. Musculus and his people are well and greet you; the same do mine. If you have anything new, let us know as well. Farewell. Bern, July 27, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord and compatriot to be honored with perpetual faith.</p>
