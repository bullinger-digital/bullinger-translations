    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger is to send the present letter to Haller's father-in-law [Ulrich Kambli], who complains about Haller's too brief messages. The letter is written in German so that the father-in-law can read it and Bullinger does not have to tell him all the details.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] When the [imperial] Italians conducted raids in the area of Donauwörth on October 7, the Augsburg authorities pursued them on horseback at night. Several imperial soldiers were killed, and eight were captured and brought to Augsburg. The main army of the Emperor [Charles V] was still stationed near Nördlingen, opposite the [Schmalkaldic League].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] A few days earlier, the Augsburgers had sent three companies as a garrison to Lauingen, joined by two Württemberg companies. On the same day [i.e., October 7], the imperial troops, who had taken Donauwörth the previous Saturday [correctly: the following Saturday, October 9], moved towards Lauingen. They consisted of 5,000 predominantly Italian soldiers, among them many cavalrymen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] After the capture of Donauwörth, there was fear of the war extending to Augsburg. The councilors therefore ordered [Sebastian] Schertlin [von Burtenbach] to proceed to Augsburg. He thus moved on the mentioned day [correctly: on the 12th] with 90 horsemen and as many arquebusiers from the main army near Nördlingen towards Lauingen. He thought he would reach the five companies stationed there, but he did not know that the Spaniards had arrived in front of this city on the same day. When he arrived there in the evening and saw the fires of the enemies, he thought they were the five [Schmalkaldic] companies. He asked their sentries where the captains of the Augsburg companies were. Thank God they were Italians who did not understand him. He also did not recognize them [as imperial soldiers], rode right through them, and called at the Lauingen city gate to let him in. But those in Lauingen took him for an enemy and fired. He shouted that it was him, but they could not believe he had come through the enemies unharmed. And so he had to wait two more hours in front of the city. Then he had to enter alone through a secret entrance before the others were allowed to follow him. This happened on October 13 at three o'clock in the morning.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] At six o'clock in the morning of the same day, Schertlin rode away again. He left the 90 arquebusiers in Lauingen. Meanwhile, the imperial forces pursued him with a cavalry squadron of about 300 men. But by a miraculous act of God, Schertlin and his riders were allowed to pass unhindered. When they saw another cavalry squadron, they believed they were close to death, and Schertlin urged them all to prove themselves brave. They thought the first squadron had deliberately let them pass so they would be encircled. But the front squadron began to flee, allowing them to continue. Afterwards, they encountered eight horses on a hill and charged at the supposed enemy; but they were friends, and they took them along.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Meanwhile, the Spaniards conducted raids as far as Augsburg. But Schertlin managed to reach his residence in Burtenbach under the cover of the forests.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Meanwhile, Lauingen had surrendered. But before that, the five [Schmalkaldic] companies had managed to sneak out of the city and set off towards Augsburg, but were soon pursued by the Spaniards. There were many dead on both sides. The Spaniards robbed the [Schmalkaldic League] of artillery and provisions. Without the protection granted by the forests, they would have had to suffer even more casualties.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] In Burtenbach, Schertlin was also almost ambushed. He left the shooters who were already stationed there in his territory and rode through the forests to Augsburg, where he arrived at nine o'clock in the evening and was let in. No one was informed. The trumpet signals given upon his arrival were mistaken by Haller for the alarm signal of an attack. But it was Schertlin!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] On the morning of October 14, he set out with six companies and 200 cavalrymen to assist the five companies from Lauingen, who were still hiding outside in the forests without protection and ammunition. In the evening, he returned with them and two other companies that had been stationed in Donauwörth.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] On October 14, the main army of the imperial forces also moved from Nördlingen towards Ulm. They left behind 2,000 horses, which the Landgrave encountered and of which he killed up to 1,000.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Ulm is also said to have been attacked. However, the Ulmers have positioned a large local army on a height [Elchingen]. In addition, there are also eight Swiss companies. The [Schmalkaldic] main army is following the imperial army. Added to this are [Duke Ulrich of] Württemberg with his troops and Schertlin. May God make it turn out well!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] The Augsburg authorities have been without news from the camp for three days. However, they are not afraid; only of traitors. Therefore, the Augsburg authorities have erected a gallows at the fish market, on which anyone who spreads frightening false rumors, writes suspiciously, or incites a mutiny shall be hanged without mercy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Recently, Ulrich Escher was with Haller. He would have liked to become a captain, but this was denied to him because it is inconvenient at the moment.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Two pastors [...] are said to have been captured and hanged by the imperial forces. Another [...] was cruelly emasculated and tortured to death by Spaniards; this was said to be the punishment for not keeping his vow of chastity, according to the Spaniards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] [Thomas] Naogeorg is very grateful for Bullinger's efforts. He has received permission from Elector [Johann Friedrich] to have his household goods brought from Saxony. The Augsburgers sent him to Kaufbeuren until the situation calms down. However, Haller does not know if Naogeorg will stay there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] Greetings from [Sebastian] Lepusculus and [Hieronymus] Gunz, who are with him. Greetings to the parish colleagues, the family, the father-in-law, and Johann Heinrich Göldli. Greetings also from the very busy [Georg] Frölich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] [Hans] Vogler [the Elder] wanted Haller to take care of his son [Hans Vogler the Younger], which is more disadvantageous to him than to Haller. If he does not shy away from the costs, Haller will endeavor to place the son in the service of the council scribe [Wolfgang Hebenstreit?], where other [under]scribes are also employed. Bullinger is to convey this to the father.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">[18] Bullinger should also have this letter sent to Bülach through Haller's father-in-law.</p>

      <p>S. through the Lord Jesus Christ. I ask you, dear father, to also send this letter to my father-in-law. I hear that he is upset because I write too briefly about current events, although I do not have enough leisure to write everything in detail. So that you are not burdened with explaining everything, I write in German so that he can read it himself.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>On the 7th day of this month, when the Italians raided over Donauwörth, my lords sent out some horsemen from the city at night to pursue them. They captured some, killed others, and brought 8 prisoners, both German and Italian, into the city. Meanwhile, the main army of the Emperor is still near Nördlingen, positioned against ours.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>A few days before, my lords had sent three companies to Lauingen as a garrison. Two Württemberg companies joined them and stayed there until the mentioned day. On this day, the army, which had taken Donauwörth the previous Saturday, moved towards Lauingen. They were up to 5,000 strong, mostly Italians, many on horseback.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>When Donauwörth was taken and fear arose that the war might move towards Augsburg or we might be overrun, my lords quickly ordered Schertlin to make his way to the city with his men. Therefore, on the mentioned day, Schertlin rode in the evening with 90 horsemen and as many arquebusiers from the main army near Nördlingen towards Lauingen, intending to join the 5 companies stationed there. However, he had no knowledge that the Spaniards had arrived there that day. As he approached the town and saw the fires of the enemy, he thought they were the 5 friendly companies. He rode into their watch and asked where the captains from Augsburg were. By God's grace, they encountered the Italians; otherwise, they would have been betrayed. The Italians mistook them for friends and did not understand what they were asked. Schertlin did not recognize them and thought they would not give him any information. He rode through them to the gate and called to be let in. Those inside the city thought they were enemies and fired upon them. Schertlin shouted that it was him, which astonished the citizens, as they could not believe he had come through the enemies. They did not want to believe him, so it took so long that, if God had not specially protected them, they would have been killed by friends and foes. He had to wait for two hours in front of the city and finally managed to be shown a secret entrance. Schertlin had to enter alone first. Once inside, they let the others in. This happened around three in the morning on the 13th.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Then, around six on the 13th of October, he rode away again. They opened the Donauwörth gate for him. Meanwhile, they realized they were in the Emperor's camp and a squadron of cavalry was sent against them, estimated at 300 men (he left the 90 arquebusiers in the town). As they moved in their order, they let them pass by God's special providence. Soon they saw another squadron ahead. They resolved to die bravely, and Schertlin encouraged them to stand together as honorable men. They thought the first squadron had deliberately let them pass to trap them. But God arranged it so that the front squadron began to flee, and they moved on in their order. They then encountered a small hill ahead. As they rode up, they saw 8 horses at the top. Thinking they were enemies, they charged at them and found they were friends. They took them along.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Meanwhile, the Spaniards raided far in, almost reaching Augsburg, which Schertlin also encountered. However, with the help of the forests, he reached Burtenbach, where he resides.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Meanwhile, Lauingen surrendered, and the 5 companies managed to escape in time towards Augsburg, pursued by the Spaniards. They skirmished, and many fell on both sides. The Spaniards captured our artillery and provisions, but many of theirs also fell. Without the forests, few of ours would have survived, although they held their ground bravely - some, not all.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Schertlin was almost ambushed in Burtenbach. He left some shooters there (who were already stationed there) and rode widely through the forests to Augsburg. God brought him there miraculously. He arrived at nine at night in front of Augsburg and was let in. No one knew anything about it. When they came in, they sounded the trumpet. I thought it was an alarm; they wanted to burn the city. Heard many horses. Everyone was frightened. But it was only Schertlin!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The 5 companies outside in the forests could not come in because of the raiding parties; they also had no more lead or powder. Therefore, on the morning of October 14, Schertlin set out with 6 companies and 200 cavalrymen. He returned in the evening, bringing the 5 companies and two others that had been stationed in Donauwörth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>On October 14, the Emperor's main army moved from Nördlingen towards Ulm, leaving behind 2,000 horses, which the Landgrave encountered. He killed up to 1,000, shot them, and drowned them in a small stream.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Ulm is also said to have been attacked. However, they have a large local force positioned on a hill. There are also 8 Swiss companies there. Our main army is following closely. The Württemberg forces with a large local army and Schertlin are on our side. May God the Lord make it turn out well.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>My lords have had no news from the camp for three days. They are brave and undaunted. However, we fear traitors among us who spread all secrets here and there. Therefore, my lords have done an unheard-of thing. They have erected a gallows at the fish market in front of the town hall, so that anyone who spreads false rumors to frighten the common man, writes suspiciously, or incites mutiny shall be hanged without mercy.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Ulrich Escher came to me today.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>I hear that two ministers of the word were captured and hanged by the imperial forces. Another was cruelly tortured by the Spaniards; his testicles were extracted with a cord, and he was horribly pierced with needles, accused of not keeping his vow of chastity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Besides this, I have nothing new, except that the good man Naogeorgus thanks you greatly for your diligence. He has obtained permission from the Elector to leave with his goods from his territory. However, since it is not convenient for him to be with us until these troubles are settled, we have sent him to Kaufbeuren, where he is now staying; but I do not know if he will remain there.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>In the meantime, farewell. Lepusculus and Guntius, who are with me while I write this, send their greetings. Greet the brothers, the family, my father-in-law, Johann Heinrich Göldli, etc. Our very busy Laetus wishes you well.</p>

      <p>Vogler has imposed his son on me, but it is more disadvantageous to him than to me. If he does not shy away from the costs, I will see that we employ him as a council scribe.
