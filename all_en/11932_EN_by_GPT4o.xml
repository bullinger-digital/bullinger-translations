    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends Cochläus' book "De autoritate ecclesiae" and a letter [from Oekolampad?], which was probably addressed to the Strasbourg colleagues; he could not find the letter to [Johannes?] Zwick. Praises the planned publication of Zwingli's works; has evasively answered corresponding questions from the people of Strasbourg, who might consider such a publication inopportune during Luther's lifetime. Myconius preached the pure doctrine of the feeding of believers in the Lord's Supper last Sunday, but should have added that Christ is not physically present. The news about [Khayr al-Din] Barbarossa, Pope [Paul III], and the French [Francis I] is alarming, while the news about the false prophet in Friesland [David Joris] seems to him, given the proximity of Emperor [Charles V], not very credible. Sends the still missing parts of his Anabaptist book ["De exordio anabaptismi"] as well as, as a gift, the [Apocalypse commentary by] Primasius. [Enclosure:] News from the Diet: On March 16, [Ludwig V] of the Palatinate died; he is succeeded by Friedrich [II the Wise], against which Bavaria opposes; on March 24, the Bishop of Jaén [Francisco de Mendoza] died; due to the war, the religious matter is not progressing; it is said that the princes are ready to declare [Francis I] an enemy, while the other estates are still deliberating, but the conditions [of the Protestant estates] are unacceptable to the Emperor; he demanded 24,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry for eight months. In St. Peter's Church in Rome, the tomb of [Emperor] Honorius and his wife Maria, along with a rich treasure, was discovered on February 9; the Emperor is said to have immediately laid claim to it through an envoy, which might deter the Pope from canonization. Greetings; the news can be shared with Vadian and others. Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg is not traveling to the Emperor due to his gout.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I am sending Cochläus' book "De autoritate ecclesiae" and a letter, which I believe was written to the brothers in Strasbourg; I could not find the other letter to Zwick, even though I searched diligently.</p>
      <p>Who would disapprove of the works of Zwingli, a man of blessed memory, being compiled into four volumes and all that he published being translated into Latin and soon to be brought to light? I have often been written to by the people of Strasbourg, asking whether Zwingli's works are in the press or not. I did not want to tell them openly, but I evaded them and inquired why they wanted to know. Do they wish to hinder that most holy work, or will they advise that it should not be published while Luther is still alive, or that the doctrine of the Eucharist should be changed and covered with Bucer's gloss? Without a doubt, they will blame and criticize your undertaking! But I know you will satisfy all those to whom this edition will be displeasing.</p>
      <p>Last Sunday, Myconius very purely handled the matter of the Eucharist and almost refuted the often-affirmed opinion that bread remains bread, wine remains wine, but in a miraculous way, the faithful are fed in the supper, since Christ is present. It should have been added how He is now present, not in the way that Christ was physically with the disciples at the supper.</p>
      <p>The news about Barbarossa, the Pope, and the French is horrifying. The Lord will undoubtedly scatter all the enemies of the Gospel. I have heard nothing at all about the false prophet and do not believe it to be true due to the continuous wars that Friesland suffered last year, so that such a one would arise with the Emperor still present.</p>
      <p>I am also sending the missing parts of the Anabaptist book, e, f, g, h, as you wrote. Furthermore, I gift you Primasius and pray that you do not despise this humble gift. April 5, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>Greet Theodor and Gwalther in my name along with Frisus.</p>
      <p>This was written to me from the Diet: "On March 16, the Elector Palatine died, the most peace-loving and studious of all princes. According to the agreement, Duke Friedrich, a relative of the Emperor, who has the Queen of Denmark as his wife, was to succeed him; but we hear that Bavaria is interfering and trying to annul the agreements as void. Also, a great Spanish bishop died on the 24th of this month, who was from the island of Jaén (some think it might be Toledo). Nothing is to be hoped for regarding religion, as Mars (the god of war) desires to rage so impiously. Some say the princes have agreed to recognize the French as an enemy, while the remaining states of the empire are still deliberating on this matter.</p>
      <p>Others say it is impossible for the Emperor to enter into those conditions proposed by them in turn; for they are such that they reform the judgment of the chamber and establish equal rights for all in everything and remove all schisms, and afterwards promise them perpetual peace. The Emperor is also said to have requested from the empire's nobles 24,000 infantry and 4,000 cavalry to be maintained at their expense for eight months. Do you see what great evils are expected for all of Germany?"</p>
      <p>It was further written to us that in the church of St. Peter in Rome, on February 9, the tomb of Honorius and his wife Maria was found with a huge treasure, namely two crowns placed on their heads, in which many precious gems. Around the queen's neck was a golden necklace with a splendid carbuncle, also a little virgin made of pure gold and some other things I do not know. When this was discovered by the Emperor, he is said to have immediately sent an envoy to Rome, through whom he would claim these goods for himself as they were found in public. If he obtains this, certainly the Pope will not canonize them, which otherwise he would have done having obtained this treasure.</p>
      <p>Farewell again. You can share this with Vadian and other good brothers. The Duke of Württemberg is suffering from gout, so he cannot visit the Emperor.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most sincere and vigilant teacher of the church of Basel, to be respected.</p>
