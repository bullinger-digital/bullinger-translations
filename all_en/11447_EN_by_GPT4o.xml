      <p>I received your letter, dearest Mr. Bullinger, on the 3rd of June, from which, although I never doubted that I was very dear to you, I perceived an even greater indication of your almost singular benevolence towards me. Since your will, kindness, and benevolence towards me are such that (as befits good men) you strive to benefit me and all students as much as possible, nothing could be more pleasing to me nor, as I believe, more honorable to you. Moreover, what I requested in my last letter could not have been handled more accurately or prudently than you have done, and by Hercules, the matter has been settled according to my wishes. Therefore, nothing would be more useful to us now than to wait there until we can know from you what should be done, and I do not doubt that this will happen soon. Your admonition, so pious and holy, was most welcome to me, and I hope you will continue to use it both with me and with my companions. Therefore, as you usually do, you will look after us with your virtue; I will diligently and carefully strive to do everything that I believe you wish and that will bring you the greatest pleasure. While I do this, I will imitate your benevolence towards me, though I will not achieve your merits. Regarding me, I would like you to judge that, as much as I can, I will take care with the utmost zeal, provided the Lord Almighty favors my endeavors.</p>
      <p>Farewell now, esteemed lord and dearest father. In Tübingen, on the day before the Nones of June 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Wolf.</p>
      <p>To the renowned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, distinguished in both learning and integrity of life, most vigilant bishop of the church in Zürich, his esteemed lord. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich, to be delivered.</p>
