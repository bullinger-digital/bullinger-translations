      <p>Greetings. I have nothing else to write to you; certain matters are pressing me. I am sending your letters to Mr. Vergerius. I am amazed that the princes of Germany are so blind that they do not understand, even now, where the plans and intrigues of the Emperor are leading. If there is anything new, I will inform you. I expect the same from your kindness. Farewell, most illustrious man. Chur, 24th of August.</p>
      <p>Your Bishop of Bayonne.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, dearest friend.</p>
