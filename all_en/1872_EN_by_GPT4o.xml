      <p>Greetings. First of all, I wish to be granted pardon, most learned man, if perhaps this request seems too importunate to you; for I have long hesitated whether I should dare to write this; but finally, your readiness to support studies has increased my confidence. Among us was Mr. Johannes Herus, a minister of the church, a good and pious man.</p>
      <p>He left behind, among other children, this young man with a very small inheritance, as our condition allows, who, having been educated in letters and instructed in Paris for four years, will be forced to abandon his course halfway due to lacking funds, unless he is helped by the aid and counsel of pious men. Indeed, our churches are not wealthy enough to assist anyone; the senate's interests are so divided, especially in matters pertaining to religion, that no hope appears from there either. Nor does his age allow him to be initiated into the ministries of the churches, to which it is forbidden to approach with unclean hands; for young men are not knowledgeable in divine matters, a more mature age is required.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since no other hope remains for completing the undertaken course, he asked me to commend him to your humanity, if perhaps some assistance could be found through you for his affairs, which are now almost desperate. I therefore beg you to kindly take up his cause, as is your custom to advocate for all pious and studious people; for this is the only thing I can offer; there is no other means available to help. He will refuse no service, no servitude, so that he may at least be allowed to engage in pious studies, by which he may reach the desired goal.</p>
      <p>Even foreigners are helped among you; if therefore a poor neighbor were to implore your help, would he not have greater hope of your compassion? But if this request seems to exceed the limit, I ask you to consider it kindly; for I believe you understand the spirit in which it is made; for I am concerned about the young man, lest he be forced to leave the good work begun unfinished. Farewell. Glarus, May 16, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Valentin Tschudi.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the church of ZÃ¼rich, most respected lord and brother.</p>
