      <p>To this, Laelius wrote certain things on paper, which when he presented to me, I encouraged him to express some things more fully and clearly. From my letter, it can be gathered what kind of writing the man had: Greetings. I read your writings, my dear Laelius, a bit more diligently when leisure allowed, and you will not be displeased if I ask you to explain some things more fully; for we are brothers and children of light.</p>
      <p>You acknowledge that the terms trinity, unity, consubstantiality, union, and distinction have been used for thirteen hundred years, but you add that you would prefer if our faith were still explained with the words of Christ and the apostles. From these words, one could gather that you do not recognize those terms as evangelical and apostolic. Certainly, if you speak of the words themselves, as they sound in Latin, I also admit that they are not found in the books of the apostles; for they wrote in Greek, and those terms are Latin. But if you speak of the matter expressed by those Latin words, it is without controversy that it is indeed handed down and clearly in the books of the apostles, and I know for sure that you acknowledge this. I once demonstrated against Cochlaeus that the matters themselves are clearly taught in the scriptures and are found to be equivalent in them. Therefore, when good men agree on some matter, they do not argue about the words, whatever they may be. The Apostles' Creed could have been enough for us even today, and there would have been no need for either the Nicene or the Constantinopolitan creeds for the ancients, if there had not been men who were not very candid, and besides, slippery, who, while they believed and taught insincerely, still wanted to appear to think rightly and therefore evaded skillfully in teaching. It was necessary, therefore, to exclude the wickedness of the evasive with certain and most significant words. Such is the term trinity (used among the Latins since the time of the apostles against Praxeas), received against Sabellius and all Patripassians.</p>
      <p>For they contended that the same father is the son, and the same is the Holy Spirit, and thus the father was incarnate and crucified and sent into the apostles. Such is also the term unity, which began to be used because of those who, due to the distance or remaining property of persons, imagined three gods. To them happened what is usually said: "He falls into Scylla, wishing to avoid Charybdis; while fools avoid vices, they run into the opposite. Such is also the term consubstantiality, received against Arius; for he admitted that Jesus Christ is the son of God, but understood him to be nonetheless lesser than the father and unequal in essence and that there was a time when he was not, etc. Such is also the term union, commended to the churches because of Nestorius; for because of the remaining property of natures in Christ, he tore apart the unity of the person, dividing one Christ into two. Finally, such is also the term distinction or property of natures, invented to exclude the Timotheans and Eutychians; for they so mixed the natures of Christ, divine and human, with each other that they contended this was converted into that and thus absorbed the human by the divine, and so retained neither and finally lost Christ himself. Since you frankly admit that you are ignorant of these things and have not been involved and exercised in these ecclesiastical matters until now, I gave you, dear Laelius, a little book from which you may learn all these things more fully and yet in summary, which I truly think has its use and benefit not to be despised. Therefore, if you acknowledge that the ancients used those terms for holy and orthodox and just reasons, it seems to me that your words should be omitted: "I would approve in every way" etc. and the rest, by which you fear for yourself from the wantonness and petulance of minds; for it seems so placed that it could be referred to the minds of those saints who used those terms. Therefore, what follows immediately: "therefore I always beware of them", should be illustrated in such a way that it is not ambiguous or uncertain whom you beware of, but it should appear clearly that you rather beware of those heretics for yourself, not of the Catholics.</p>
      <p>Which indeed I think you feel completely, so I wish you to express it also in clear words and with an unencumbered sense.</p>
      <p>It seems more circumspect to also place that which you wish to be preserved by God through the man Jesus Christ, his only-begotten son, who has from God the entire nature, wisdom, and power. For you know that in Christ both natures, divine and human, are to be considered, according to that he is consubstantial with the father, according to this he is consubstantial with us.</p>
      <p>Therefore, according to the divine nature, he is in all things coequal with the father, according to the human nature he is lesser than the father and is read to have received power and the rest, but not nature. I admit that the Lord himself said: "As the father has life in himself, so he has given to the son" etc. But see how well you keep the context, Cyril rightly said: Therefore, the reason why he said these things were given to him by the father, he immediately added saying: "Because he is the son of man", so that we understand all things were given to him as a man, who, being a creature, has nothing from himself, the only-begotten not a partaker of life, but life naturally as the father is. Many other evangelical places agree with this exposition, as when we read the word is God, is light, is equal to God, and what the Lord himself said: "Truly, I say to you, before Abraham was, I am. I and the father are one. Believe in God and believe in me. Believe me, that I am in the father and the father in me. And now glorify me, you father, with yourself with the glory I had with you before the world was." To which especially the place of the apostle Philippians 2 and to the Hebrews 1 and others apply. But I know these things are not in doubt with you; I mention them only for this purpose, that you may understand why I think those things of yours should be placed more circumspectly, and certainly you can more easily (I ask you to take it kindly, that I even supply words to you; for I love you and know you love the light) speak or write thus: "Through Jesus Christ the only-begotten son, our only mediator and therefore true God and man, in whom you to me" etc. Furthermore, I also feel that heretical men should be cut off with the spiritual sword, especially those who spit blasphemies against the divine majesty, and should be avoided in every way. However, if, having been sufficiently admonished and convicted of errors, they make no end, but moreover continue to disturb the pious and stir up movements, and not only destroy themselves but also drag whole crowds with them to destruction, here I add that it is the duty of the holy magistrate to restrain such pestilent men and not to permit them to continue what they have begun, I add further that such should be punished and can and should be, especially for blasphemy, and that according to the measure of the crime and circumstances with moderation and Christian clemency, because I see this has been used and accepted at all times by all the saints in the world. About which matter I do not now institute a dispute, since it has been abundantly disputed by the ancients and moderns. I only wanted to mention in my letter, to which you then joined your writing, what you were then discussing with me, nor do I think you find anything lacking in my narration; for I have invented nothing. Meanwhile, if you with many others do not yet see that the magistrate can punish heretics, perhaps you will see sometime. It once seemed unjust to Augustine to restrain heretics by force and not by the word of God alone; but finally, having been exercised by various cases, he learned by experience that force is beneficially applied. The Lutherans themselves did not once see that sectarians should be restrained and punished; but after the Münster disaster and the killing of many miserable and deceived people, add also thousands of rightly believing people, they were forced to admit that those who not only command the magistrate to restrain petulant minds but also to consult the welfare of many thousands of people by the deserved punishment of one or another, think more prudently and better. About which the ministers of the churches of Lüneburg have testified through Mr. Urbanus Rhegius in a published German booklet. I once explained to you, dear Laelius, in a letter written to you, to what extent it is allowed to search the scriptures and inquire in matters of religion, nor do I feel otherwise today. No one, however, takes away from you the freedom of modestly inquiring and learning, no one again approves or can approve if you or another rashly express your thoughts or rather your temptations and wicked and offensive ones everywhere, not observing the choice of time, places, and persons, indeed defending them up to shouts and quarrels." The apostle says, "Evil communications corrupt good manners." The same: "Let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth, but that which is good to the use of edifying, that it may minister grace unto the hearers, and grieve not the holy spirit of God, whereby ye are sealed unto the day of redemption." Who indeed does not know that untimely and offensive speeches about religion are more pernicious than those foul and obscene ones? For now even the hearts of the simpler ones, inflamed by those wicked opinions, begin to be vexed and have learned to suspect something they had not thought of before.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the judgment of God was to be feared here, that it is better to be drowned in the sea with infamous punishment than to offend one of the little ones. Therefore, I think it is better to express such thoughts and the agitations of a wounded mind only to those who can heal, and then, joining with them in prayers to God, to obey those who advise well and not to remain perpetually in the same mire and always turn and return to the same questions.</p>
      <p>In explaining the scriptures, the rule of faith and charity is prescribed to us, to which we should refer all our expositions.</p>
      <p>The apostle also prescribes an excellent rule saying: "I say through the grace given unto me, to every man that is among you, not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think soberly, according as God hath dealt to every man the measure of faith," and the rest in Romans 12.</p>
      <p>All these things, my Laelius, I do not write to you to start a new dispute with you about punishing heretics, about necessary or harmful questions, and about explaining the scriptures (I wanted to advise you as a friend and confer with you for your salvation), but to show you what I wish to be written more clearly in your confession, once adapted to our words made by you in my presence, now however confirmed by your hand in my writings.</p>
      <p>However, I will gladly advocate your cause as I promised, with certain people, so that they do not continue to suspect you wrongly, but rather that peace may prevail and we may love each other mutually. "Blessed are the peacemakers," says the Lord, "for they shall be called the children of God." The words of blessed James are always before my eyes, which I wish were engraved in the hearts of all learned and unlearned: "Who is a wise man and endued with knowledge among you? Let him show out of a good conversation his works with meekness of wisdom. But if ye have bitter envying and strife in your hearts, glory not, and lie not against the truth; this wisdom descendeth not from above, but is earthly, sensual, devilish" etc. and the rest, which you know, from chapter 3.</p>
      <p>Do not doubt, my Laelius, that you are most commended to me in prayers and charity; in turn, I wish to be loved by you in Christ and to be commended to God in your prayers, that running rightly we may obtain the prize of eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord, in whom I wish you to be well. Zurich, July 10, in the year of our Lord 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
