      <p>To Wolfgang Rüpplin, the most worthy abbot and patron, grace and peace be multiplied. Regarding the passage from Matthew 20 [1 ff], which you requested from us, and which we understand without prejudice, accept the following in a few words.</p>
      <p>Peter had heard that among men it is not possible for anyone to be saved [Mt 19,23ff], that this is fully entrusted and deposited with God alone, meaning that salvation does not come from human merits, but only from the grace, generosity, and liberality of God. Moved by this, Simon Peter said: What then, Lord? Is it in vain that we have followed you, leaving everything behind? Will we be superior to others [Mt 19,27]? We had indeed thought that we would receive a much greater reward, so now we first hear that all human works are in vain?</p>
      <p>To this, Christ responds that the reward for the saints is indeed at the beginning and occurs, but not because of works or merits, but only because of grace, which rewards all equally with an equal reward and warns not to be exalted because of the calling or the fruits worthy of the calling, whether Simon or anyone else, because many are cast down who seem to stand most firmly, and again many who go away are called and those lying down are raised up to the Lord. But he explains these things most clearly and copiously with a parable, so that there would be no obscurity in the words; and thus we have taught in our "Prophet" that parables are used. Therefore, the householder is God, who, like a diligent and faithful householder, governs and adorns all things with his providence. Furthermore, the vineyard is the evangelical kingdom, which, as it relies on Christ as the only branch, indeed the true vine, is pruned by the Father in this way, so that it may bear the most beautiful clusters in faith, charity, patience, and innocence of life. Now, just as the householder pays the same price to the first and the last, indeed he sharply rebukes the first and kindly addresses the last, so God gives eternal life equally to all and sometimes rebukes the first and the faithful and those who seemed stronger than others, thrusts them into sins, utterly confounds them, so that they may recognize themselves and not be exalted, but brings the last into the field, so that they may proclaim the mercy of God and we may praise and acknowledge grace. An example of the former is David and Peter, of the latter is Magdalene and Zacchaeus. Therefore, no one should despair, no one should be exalted. And just as the reward does not come according to the quantity of labors, but only from the agreement of the householder, so righteousness does not come to us from our merit, work, or labor, but only from the agreement, that is, from providence and grace. Concerning this, see Romans 9 [6 ff] and Ephesians 1 [4ff]. If you murmur, the Lord now responds: "Friend, I do you no wrong" etc. [Mt 20, 13]. Just as Paul also says: "Who has given a gift to him first?" etc. [Romans 11, 35]. And again: "Will the thing formed say to him who formed it" etc. [Romans 9,20].</p>
      <p>Furthermore, that most elegant parable is closed with a double γνώμαι (sentence). The first: "So the last will be first" etc. [Mt 20,16]. As if to say: Therefore, learn from this parable not to hope in works, when there is one equal reward for all, learn not to hope in yourselves; do not be exalted if you have done any good, but fear, for you can be cast down: Romans 11 [20]. The second: "For many are called" etc. [Mt 20,16]; which interprets the former, as is the custom of double sentences, as if to say: For I tell you most certainly, that not all to whom the word is preached and who think they believe and do many works are saved, but those who are chosen from eternity and who are drawn in the heart. Romans 8 [29], 9 [6ff], John 6 [44], 2 Thessalonians 3 [5].</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
