    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Vadian has returned Bullinger's writing ["Contra scandala ex bello infeliciter gesto oborta Apologia"] early enough and does not need to apologize [for keeping it a little longer]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger was very pleased with the sending of the English Reformation decrees ["Mandatorum epitome"]. The noble Englishman [John Hooper] residing in Zurich had already received the detailed English version of these decrees and briefly presented them to him. Thanks to Vadian's copy (which he will return), the whole matter has become even clearer to him. The same [Hooper] learned new details about the battle from an Italian [...] who traveled through Zurich with 15 horses on his way to Italy and had participated in the battle between the English and the Scots. [Hooper] also received a description of it made in Antwerp. Both reports agree with Vadian's account [in No. 3058], except that there were two battles: In the first, about 14,000, and in the second, about 3,000 Scots lost their lives. In the second, noble Scottish leaders were also captured. However, the English also suffered losses. In London, peace is now being negotiated between the two kingdoms. Meanwhile, the French have captured an important ship from the English King Edward VI not far from England. If they do not return it, it will lead to a new bitter war between France and England, caused by the cunning machinations of Emperor Charles V. By setting the kings against each other, he breaks their power to establish his sole rule.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Nothing great is to be expected from the Diet of Augsburg. Here is the relevant statement from the letter of the Augsburg city clerk Georg Frölich from October 25 [No. 3055]: "I no longer have hope regarding the freedoms of Germany and the public preaching of the Gospel, as all the papal supporters, who prevail in the votes, speak in favor of the already made and future decisions of the Council of Trent and strive [for a cessation of the proclamation of the Gospel]. The imperial cities are also so drained that they can hardly remain free and will soon be imposed with city bailiffs and tax collectors. King Ferdinand, this son of the devil, who has terribly devastated Bohemia and killed its best men, has now arrived in Augsburg and will destroy the little remaining fortune. God have mercy on us!" Blarer wrote in agreement on October 28 [in No. 3059]: "A letter has just arrived from Augsburg. It states that King Ferdinand has arrived, and that the Emperor has forbidden a preacher [Johannes Weiß] of Duke Maurice of Saxony to preach because of his outspoken speeches. Everything will get even worse."</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The documents enclosed here provide information about the situation in Constance. Vadian should only share them with the most trustworthy people, not reveal their origin, and return them with the next reliable messenger, as Bullinger cannot do without them for long. Bullinger had long suspected the reconciliation of the people of Constance with the Emperor, especially since the Zurich council once sent Mayor Johannes Haab and three times Guild Master Georg Müller (a member of the triumvirate) to Constance to explore the possibility of an alliance of Constance with the Confederation, or the four [Protestant] places, or even just with Zurich, but the councilors of Constance strangely remained undecided. And when King Henry II of France sent his envoy [Sébastien de l’Aubespine, abbé de Bassefontaine] to the people of Constance and showed himself very accommodating to them, they could think of nothing better than to emphasize in their response that they still want to recognize the Emperor as the supreme head on earth and do not intend to leave the holy [Roman] Empire. But no one had asked this of them! It was only about agreeing on an arrangement to prevent the stationing of imperial troops in Constance. Vadian can gather from the enclosure how things stand with the people of Constance now.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The people of Zurich have tried everything, and this despite the fact that the people of Inner Switzerland have always made them feel the aversion they have towards the people of Constance. Now envoys of the Emperor, the King of France (if the delegate [Louis Daugerant, Seigneur de Boisrigaut] has not already returned to Solothurn), and Pope Paul III are in Lucerne; and it is said that the people of Inner Switzerland have received money from the envoys. But the latter want to divide the already discordant Confederates! And no one thinks of the welfare of the fatherland! All or many are only chasing after the money of the princes. But eventually, even a Crassus will have enough of foreign gold! Bullinger expects nothing good from these people. They will one day cause the fall of Helvetia, as they not only oppose the word of God but also let themselves be driven by their desires, their recklessness, and their unbridled passions, so as not to have to live reasonably and decently! Surely God will not tolerate such behavior in the long run and will also bring those who ally with them to ruin. A trustworthy man [...] said today that high-ranking people of Lucerne said: "We hear that the people of Bern have made an alliance with King Henry II. We will not allow that! For many reasons, they will have to revoke it!" In short: These people want to have the say and control. They are so evil, arrogant, and rude that this can only have the worst consequences for the Confederation. May the Lord save all who call upon him! Some people of Inner Switzerland say openly: "You may hope for our help if you are attacked; but you can only count on that if you give up your new religion and return to the old faith." This is their attitude, their loyalty, and their friendship!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] It would therefore be good if the [Protestant places] did not place their hope in them, but rather strive for peace and neither engage with the Emperor nor with the King of France, even though both are now pressing for an alliance. One could respond to them kindly as follows: "We have the inheritance agreement [of 1511] with you, Emperor; with you, King, the [Eternal] Peace [of 1516]. We want to adhere to that. We do not want to take sides, but be good friends to both of you." Enough of that! Bullinger is probably boring Vadian with his considerations. But all this burdens him greatly because the welfare of the common fatherland is close to his heart, and he has to watch as these people, over whom he has no power, endanger it. May the Lord save his church!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Bullinger sends Johannes Bugenhagen's report ["How it went with us in Wittenberg"], which he recently received from Count Georg of Württemberg-Mömpelgard. Vadian should return it along with the copy of the letter from the people of Constance (perhaps he has already received it from other friends). Through the report, Bugenhagen's nature is revealed better than any painter could have done! Not even a Beguine could have acted more foolishly in such a serious matter! With this, these people expose themselves and the [evangelical] faith to the mockery and contempt of the enemies. Their description of Luther's death ["Doctor Martin Luther's Christian departure and death"?] was just as foolish. May they be granted a better death!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] With this letter, Bullinger hopes to have made up for his long silence. Vadian should receive it with indulgence. Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] [P.S. from November 4:] A messenger [...] from Schwyz brought a letter from the Five Places. It states that the Zurich councilors may have wondered what the Five Places have discussed among themselves several times. It was always about the Emperor, who, according to serious warnings, is planning an attack. In view of the danger, they propose [to the leading place] Zurich to call for a Diet. And so one was convened for November 20. Yesterday a messenger [...] was dispatched to St. Gallen to inform them there. Bullinger fears some kind of trick behind it.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You have returned the apology quite early, most illustrious man. Therefore, there is nothing for which I need to forgive you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>You have greatly gratified me by sending the Epitome of the English Reformation. A certain noble Englishman, who resides with us, had indeed told me the summary of the reformation. He had received the complete version, written in English. However, I understood everything more clearly from your book, which I will return at some point. The same Englishman learned about the entire matter as it happened from a certain Italian, who participated in the war between the English and the Scots and returned to Italy accompanied by 15 horses. He also received the entire history written in Antwerp. The entire matter is indeed as you narrate, except that they fought twice. In the first battle, about 14,000 Scots and Scottish mercenaries fell, and in the second, 3,000, in which also the principal Scottish leaders were captured. The victory was not bloodless for the English either. Now a diet is being held in London, where peace and the composition of the kingdoms are being discussed. Meanwhile, the French, not far from England, have seized the most excellent ship of the English king; unless they return it, a new and very bitter war will be waged between the two, which will be due to the cunning plans of the Emperor. For he will wear down the strength of the kings by mutual collision, so that he can more easily break them when they are weakened. It is certain that this corpse is contemplating monarchy, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Do not expect anything remarkable from Augsburg and the diet. I will quote to you the words of G. Laetus, the most excellent man and chief scribe of Augsburg, which he recently sent to me on October 25: "I have little hope left for the freedom of Germany and the retention of public preaching of the Gospel. For all the papists, who prevail in the votes, subscribe to the past and future Council of Trent and seek it. The imperial cities are so exhausted, so they tremble and are oppressed, that it seems impossible for them to remain free. Soon you will see them having received both governors and tax collectors. King Ferdinand, the son of perdition, has miserably devastated Bohemia and, having slaughtered every good man, has come to Augsburg to destroy the remaining happiness. May God have mercy on us!" etc. These words agree with what Blaurer wrote to me on October 28: "Now I have a letter from Augsburg, stating that the king has arrived and the emperor has forbidden Duke Maurice's preacher to preach because of his boldness. But worse things will follow." This is what he wrote.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You can understand the situation of the people of Constance from what I am sending, but I send these under the condition that you only share them with the most trustworthy people, who should not even know from where you have them. You will return them with the next reliable messenger you find, as I cannot do without them for long. I foresaw this long ago, especially when our most honorable council sent Mayor Haab once, and Tribune of the People and Triumvir Georg Mülner three times, to explore how the people of Constance could be united with either all the Swiss, or the four cities, or the people of Zurich. However, they strangely hesitated and procrastinated. And while the French sent their envoy to the people of Constance, almost promising them their crown, they could not elicit any other response than that they recognize the emperor as the supreme head on earth and never want to defect from that holy empire - which no one demanded, but only some agreement to ensure that they would never accept imperial garrisons. Now the situation is as you will understand from my attached notes.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Nothing has been neglected by our people, although the people of Inner Switzerland have always shown their ill will towards the people of Constance. They now have imperial, French (unless he has just returned to Solothurn), and papal envoys in Lucerne, from whom it is rumored they receive benefits. These people want to divide us with factions, and indeed we are divided, while no one thinks about preserving the fatherland, but all or most are concerned with extracting gold from the princes. Believe me, most illustrious Vadian, Crassus will eventually be satisfied with foreign gold. I have no hope left regarding these people. Indeed, they will be the ruin of Helvetia, as they not only oppose the word of God but are not guided by any reason or decency; pleasure, frivolity, and unrestrained passions drive them in any direction. Divine justice will not tolerate the most pestilent and extreme wickedness. It will also destroy those who join them. Although today a man of not fleeting faith reported to me that some leading people in Lucerne say: "We hear that the people of Bern have allied themselves with the king of the French by some treaty. We will not allow that! They will be forced to renounce that treaty, and for many reasons." In short: These people want to rule and prescribe to everyone! Their malice, arrogance, and barbarism are so great that it cannot be borne or go out without great detriment to Helvetia. May the Lord preserve all who call upon his name! Among them are people who openly say: "You may hope for help from us if war is brought upon you; but you should not expect any help from us unless you first renounce your new religion, recall and accept the old one." These are the plans of these people; this is their faith, this is their friendship!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I would consider us abundantly happy if we placed no hope in them, pursued peace, and, since the emperor and the French king demand alliances, allied with neither. It would be a friendly response if we said: "We have an agreement with you, emperor, a peace with you, king. We want to remain by that, not take sides, but be good friends to both of you, etc." But perhaps I am being too bothersome to you with this. However, these things trouble my mind, as I desire the common fatherland to be safe, which I see being lost by those over whom I have no power. May the Lord preserve his church! Amen.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I am sending the description of the dangers and surrender of the city of Wittenberg by Pomeranus, which the most illustrious Prince Georg, Count of Württemberg, sent to me in recent days. You will return it along with the letters or copies of the people of Constance. Perhaps you have already received such a description from friends. Pomeranus depicted himself in this description better than any painter could have. He could not have described a serious matter more foolishly, ineptly, dissolutely, or stupidly! These people present both themselves and our entire religion to the enemies for ridicule and contempt! They described the death of Dr. Luther with equal foolishness. I wish them a better death, etc.!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I have not written to you for a long time, most excellent Vadian. With this, I make amends for my fault. Forgive my foolishness. Live and farewell. October 31, 1547. Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The people of Schwyz are sending their messenger. He brings a letter from the Five Places, stating that my lords may consider what they have discussed alone several times: It concerns the emperor, from whose plans they have received many warnings. Now they say, "Speak of the devil long enough, and he will appear," etc. They leave it to my lords to decide whether it is useful and necessary to call a diet in such dangers, etc. This happened on November 20. However, yesterday a messenger ran up to you, so that you know everything, etc. I fear, I fear delay and deceit! May God protect us. November 4.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Joachim Vadian, his lord.</p>
