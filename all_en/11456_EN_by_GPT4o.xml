    <p xml:id="regest1">Refers to his earlier reports about the Marburg school. The Zwinglian doctrine is disreputable here among everyone except Geldenhauer; Gwalther lives in seclusion to avoid discussions. Not only the students, but also the professors live licentiously; except for Eobanus Hessus, he does not associate with any of them. He would like to receive instructions from Froschauer on what he should do, as he does not want to stay here. Sends poems by [Johannes] Pollius; the poem "Ecclesiastomoria," which he sent to the student Georg Honderlage, might perhaps be printed in Zurich. Includes his own poems about Zwingli and reminds Bullinger of the promise to suggest a topic for a poem. Confirms the rumor of the Landgrave's morganatic marriage; Hessian theologians under the leadership of Dionysius Melander have approved it - Bullinger should reprimand the latter -, and Bucer is also said to have agreed, while Duke [Heinrich] of Saxony will hardly tolerate the dishonorable treatment of the Landgravine and Luther has also criticized the responsible theologians. Arsonists have plagued Einbeck and Bingen. His criticism of the Landgrave's morganatic marriage should not become publicly known. Points out his insufficient financial means and wishes for a response regarding Pollius. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>I am sending a third letter now, most kind father, so that you may not find me lacking in the duty of writing. However, whether you have received the previous ones or not, I am completely unaware; for I sent both to Frankfurt, so that they might be carried from there to Basel. In them, as much as the opportunity of time allowed then, I described the customs of this academy. Desiring a fuller understanding of which, you will learn everything exactly from Ammianus's letters; for I did not want to delay you longer now, as there are many other things I have to write.</p>
      <p>Let this one thing be certain to you, that our religion is considered here as new, perverse, and plainly seditious. However, I have understood that none of the professors publicly rages against us except one, whose name I now omit, yet he is not a theologian, but the head of another lecture. I presented your letters to Noviomagus upon his return from Hagenau, as well as to Bedrotus, who had also recommended me to him; he promises all good things, nor do I doubt his humanity, which I hear praised by many. For he is, as I hear, the only one who is more inclined to the customs of our church. However, since I have not at all decided to stay here longer, I abstain from all commerce, lectures, and disputations both public and private, so as not to be involved in quarrels and tumults stirred up over religion. Yet often I grieve not a little and almost burst from not grieving, when I understand that the man of most holy memory, Zwingli, is criticized undeservedly. But what can I do? It must be endured, what cannot be changed. For these are now the customs, these are the times, that whoever intends to please Luther (whom many venerate as a god) believes the easiest way to gain this favor is by criticizing Zwinglian doctrine. To defend his authority here is neither my place nor, if it were, would it be safe; for I would involve myself in inextricable labyrinths, dangers, hatreds, and envy.</p>
      <p>The discipline of morals here is such as Bacchus (Bacchanten) prescribes to his followers and Venus to her Cupids: to be drunk, to vomit, to be seen staggering here and there through the streets is not shameful, indeed it is a matter of praise, laughter, and jest. If you see a student, you will doubt whether you are looking at a soldier or someone initiated into the Muses. But why should the students not use these customs, when the majority of the professors are accustomed to them?</p>
      <p>The dizziness of the head produces a languor of the limbs. I associate with no professor's familiarity except Eobanus Hessus, who, as far as I can judge, loves me sincerely.</p>
      <p>I honor him, indeed, I delight in him. I shake off the commerce of all the rest.</p>
      <p>I ask you, please, to ensure that I am informed through Froschauer where I should go. I will go to Frankfurt myself; for I have not decided to spend the winter here, unless I am ordered by you, to whom I have resolved to accommodate my whole mind. You decide what pleases you; it will be mine to execute what is decided. Yet I hardly believe this school will please you so much that you would wish to bind me to it.</p>
      <p>I am sending you the poems of Pollius, as learned as they are pious, who acts as a minister of the word in Westphalia, which if you read, I do not doubt they will please you. He also sent here to Georg Honderlage, a student of medicine, other poems, the title of which is Ecclesiastomoria, divided into four sermons, the first of which exposes the contempt of truth, papal abuses, old heresies, the type of the old church, the morals of this age. The second is to Germany, to embrace the reborn truth. The third is to a certain Pompilianus, not to allow himself to be moved away from true piety by the turmoils of the age, the threats of princes, and the rumors and persecutions of wars. The fourth teaches that poverty is not to be shunned by Christians. There are perhaps four or five leaves, which if you think worthy to be printed by you, I would send to you at the next fair. Nor is there any need to buy a copy at great expense. For the man asks for nothing, as he seeks not profit, but piety. The poem is such that it befits both a poet and a theologian and is not inconsistent with our religion.</p>
      <p>For I have read it most diligently. From this present description of monsters, you will be able to have a taste of the other. To me, it certainly seems worthy to be entrusted to posterity, printed in the most beautiful type. You, indicate what you wish to be done.</p>
      <p>I am sending you what I have played in honor of Zwingli, the liberator of our homeland, in my spare hours, in which I order you to regard the spirit, not the elegance of the verses, nor do I doubt that these will also please you, as nothing does not please you, which the labors of students are wont to produce. I will perhaps send others also at the fair, if only I can through the brevity of time. You promised to propose a subject for a poem to me, which I would greatly desire you to do, but at that time, when I have been received into a place suitable for rest and my studies. For the Muses often flee from one wandering here and there.</p>
      <p>What I wrote in the first letters about the prince's second marriage, you should know to be plainly true. For he took as his wife a noble virgin, Martha von der Sal, who previously served her sister. Several Hessian theologians consented to this marriage, whose leader and standard-bearer is Dionysius Melander, who previously acted as a minister in Frankfurt. I would like you to treat him according to your right over him for his merits, a man worthy of any cross. No one hopes for a change and repudiation unless secretly with that second wife removed. For the mind has become callous with lust, the theologians persist in defending it for the prince's favor. She lives in a certain monastery Wisenstein with several noble virgins, whom she has from the prince to serve her, and differs in nothing from a true princess, indeed she wants to be considered worthy of that honor and name. She received as a dowry (as common rumor has it) twenty thousand florins. There are those who say Bucer consented; whether this is true or not, I do not know. I wish all the authors of this to be taken to distant lands. Meanwhile, the best princess, the legitimate wife, mother of two princes and four daughters, still in form and age intact, is scorned and despised. What the Duke of Saxony will do is unknown, but he will hardly leave it unpunished. Luther certainly at Eisenach, where a meeting was recently held, received those theologian rascals with the harshest words. This, indeed, is that excellent soldier of Christ, whom all considered the patron of the true church. You should know these things to be as true as if they were spoken from the tripod (as the proverb is wont to say).</p>
      <p>In these parts, those whom they call arsonists are raging in a remarkable manner; several villages and towns have been burned. Einbeck, a most famous city, was entirely consumed by fire with three hundred citizens. In Bingen on the Rhine, 150 houses perished in a similar disaster. There is such a great abundance of robbers, thieves, and most wicked men everywhere, that you might rightly say all the furies have conspired against the human race.</p>
      <p>These are the things I have now; you only beware (if you wish me to remain here longer), that many do not learn these things reported by me. For I hear it is a capital offense, if anyone inveighs against this marriage granted by divine law, if it pleases the gods.</p>
      <p>As for the stipend, I ask you to ensure that I have sufficient expenses for living, so that I am not forced to be a supplicant to foreigners and those alien to our religion. Certainly, it would be impossible to spend the whole winter on eight or nine florins. I hope, however, that you will be such to me as parents are to a son. I will take care that you do not regret this expense. Especially regarding Pollius, make sure I receive a certain response, for I will bring the written copy with me to Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name Mr. Pellicanus, Theodor, and my other most esteemed teachers, especially your mother and wife with the whole family. Farewell, most kind father.</p>
      <p>In Marburg, the day before the Nones of August 1540.</p>
      <p>Your most observant</p>
      <p>Rod. Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most kind and especially esteemed father. In Zurich.</p>
