      <p>Greetings. I received your letters through our Löffelsperger, and if the concerns of our wedding and the hope of your arrival did not hinder me, I might have written more; for I have written to my brother these days that I have betrothed my daughter Elizabeth, whose godmother is your daughter Elisabeth Simler, to Mr. Daniel Delsperger, minister of the church in Münsingen, and we are to celebrate the wedding on the next Thursday.</p>
      <p>I have therefore asked him to persuade you to honor us with your presence, which we have been expecting for so many years.</p>
      <p>Whether you will do this, I indeed hope, yet I am somewhat doubtful in the meantime. Certainly, nothing could be more pleasing to me and our entire city; for I rejoice that you are well again and have resumed your work, part of which I would wish you to devote to this journey. As for our alliance, I am in greater anxiety than ever; for a royal envoy was here these days and has achieved so much anew that all the prefects are to be convened again at the next moon. There, the supporters of this alliance will attempt and strive anew to break through, unless God hinders them.</p>
      <p>It is astonishing that they are so blinded, when they see both God and most subjects opposing and also perceive what is already arising among the Rhaetians.</p>
      <p>But such is the power of gold, although they do not wish to appear that this is the cause. I have written more on this matter to Mr. Gwalther, who will share it with you. I have often prayed for your Daniel and am very glad that we will soon have that work. We are now expecting writings from the Heidelberg fair.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I ask you to let us know what you think about the propositions that Johannes Damius recently brought with him. The reasons noted above make me brief; therefore, consider these few words kindly.</p>
      <p>I return to you the letters of Fabritius and Zanchi and give my greatest thanks. We wish to know the outcome of the matter.</p>
      <p>The lords consuls and treasurers, Diesbach, Grafenried, Zehender, and others, especially my father-in-law, my wife, and mother, send their greetings to you. May all yours be well.</p>
      <p>Bern, April 3, 1565.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours forever.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my lord and compatriot, to be honored by me with utmost faith and respect.</p>
