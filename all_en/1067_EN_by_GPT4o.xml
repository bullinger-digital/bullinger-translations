      <p>Greetings. He came here from Straßburg, lectured for some time, but after he returned from Saxony, where he had been appointed, he was released from his duty and another was appointed in his place; thus he is now without a teaching position. He will go to his homeland, Lindau; in the meantime, he visits churches that are still intact, to receive some consolation from them. You should welcome him together with your people in such a way that he understands what kind of leaders Zürich has in the church.</p>
      <p>Besides this, Mr. Hedio wrote to Count Georg about the disaster of the people of Magdeburg from a printed booklet. It was said that three thousand were missing; the booklet states 200.</p>
      <p>However, they openly acknowledge that their pride was visited by the Lord, and they will be more cautious in the future. He can also speak more accurately about this matter.</p>
      <p>Everyone is wondering what the Emperor is doing in Augsburg; there is no mention of him, even from those who come to us from there or write. Some Swabians speak vaguely: perhaps he has died, others: he is planning something evil. It is certain that Ferdinand and the Duke of Bavaria have left and that he himself has renounced his lodging as if he will not return. There is also a rumor that many Spaniards have been ordered to withdraw and set out for Italy; there an army is being gathered to restore Savoy and thus to wage war against us.</p>
      <p>It is strange why our people, after knowing these things, are so secure; it will harm them someday.</p>
      <p>It is peculiar to the Emperor to feign and dissemble everything and, when you least expect it, to attack what he has long been weaving, and thus to oppress people. How many times have we seen this over several years? And yet we learn nothing from it.</p>
      <p>However, we might learn if we all had the wisdom of Christ. But because we do not have this wisdom, our senses are neither sound nor whole. But what is that? Surely God wants to teach us something that we refuse with better reason.</p>
      <p>They say the end of the truce between the Emperor and the Turk is approaching around the feast of Saint George; for this reason, the Turk has occupied Transylvania. If this is true, I am convinced it was done not without the consent of the Transylvanians, because in this way they are safer in body and soul than under Ferdinand, provided the Turk allows the purity of the gospel, as also elsewhere in occupied Hungary. Tell me what you think.</p>
      <p>I wish to know what is happening in Africa. The Emperor's people boast of some city there being recovered, 700 Turks killed, and new lands occupied; they rejoice and hope that the Swiss will soon be similarly oppressed due to the Emperor's perpetual success. Farewell and respond sometime. May Gwalther, Otho, and the rest of your household be safe. Basel, November 3, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
