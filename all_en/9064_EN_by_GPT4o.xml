      <p>My friendly greetings, willing service, and all good things beforehand, venerable, faithful, dear godfather. When I received your esteemed message, I inform you that our confederates from Schwyz sent a messenger here on the 9th of October and requested from my lords in Glarus that they, the people of Schwyz, want to convene a large assembly or landsgemeinde as soon as possible and set the date when this will happen; then they want to come to such a landsgemeinde with their message, as they have something to present to them.</p>
      <p>Our gracious lords were greatly alarmed, fearing great unrest. Also, a nobleman from Italy has come: he says that the Spaniards who fought against the Turks are all returning home from Italy with all their might, which makes our people wonder if they will be allowed to pass through Burgundy.</p>
      <p>A notable man from Lucerne also informs one of our people in secret that it is not the intention that the king desires mercenaries from the confederates.</p>
      <p>The king has merely made a pretense, making the cities in France weaker, should they surrender. However, the king has made the confederates cheerful, has paid the leaders, and announced that there is plenty of money available; for the confederates will soon have other matters to deal with.</p>
      <p>But what that might be, he did not want to reveal. Therefore, we need to be vigilant and pray. May God give us wise counsel, grace, and support. Amen. Whatever news you have, let me know. I will also send you all the proceedings from Schwyz as soon as possible, and if there is anything dangerous, through a special messenger.</p>
      <p>You are faithfully entrusted to the Lord, the Almighty God, along with all yours. My wife and children greet you.</p>
      <p>Given in great haste on the 10th of October, in the year 1572. Your always willing godfather Johannes Hugo of Glarus.</p>
      <p>Mr. Landschreiber Elmer informs me, our messenger, who was in Solothurn, named Vogt Hösli, says that the places are besieging the cities badly, and he thinks well, if they now mean to maintain peace, that they will not help to persecute our faith, they would do it; but since they remain silent, they will help to execute the council, etc. Also tell me, if they desire our lord's bailiff's scholar, my gracious lords would gladly comply, to give all good reports on how they are now and have been in the past, so that one would know better how to behave, which he would not dare to do without being asked. The day is set by those from Schwyz for this coming Tuesday, the 14th of October.</p>
      <p>To the pious, venerable, well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossmünster in Zurich, my faithful, dear lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
