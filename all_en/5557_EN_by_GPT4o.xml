      <p>Greetings. Although it is still somewhat difficult to write to you about uncertain matters, venerable brother, since this good young man offered his services to me in delivering letters, I did not want to miss this opportunity. It is difficult for us to conjecture what Prince Condé is planning.</p>
      <p>Around the beginning of this month, he had moved his troops up to the walls of Paris; a siege of a few days had nearly starved the city. Twice the soldiers of Guise had gone out beyond the ramparts, but having been fiercely repulsed, they began to rest. Hence, the queen mother resorted to her usual arts.</p>
      <p>The prince, in his usual easy manner, wasted time in deceitful negotiations, which should have been more devoted to conducting affairs. It was generally thought that peace had been concluded when, unexpectedly, the Spanish and the British arrived to support the enemies, whose spirits immediately rose. The prince withdrew his army further away.</p>
      <p>The Guises followed.</p>
      <p>On the fifteenth of this month, both camps were in the region of Beauce towards Chartres and Le Mans. It was written from Paris and confirmed by certain indications that they had clashed in a light skirmish and that seven hundred Spaniards had fallen.</p>
      <p>The news is credible because many wounded were brought into the city by carts and vehicles. The enemies are better equipped with infantry.</p>
      <p>The prince is far superior in cavalry.</p>
      <p>The rumor that Rouen had been recaptured by our forces is now found to be false: yet I do not think it arose from nothing, but rather that what should have been kept secret was prematurely spread by the indiscretion of some. If it is true, as I am reasonably convinced, that six thousand English have joined the prince, it will be a welcome addition.</p>
      <p>Indeed, unless he wanted to advance to meet them to encourage them, he shamefully turned back in cowardice. The Parisians themselves are rushing more furiously than before.</p>
      <p>Private individuals are accustomed to obtaining a pardon for their age from princes so that they may be their own masters. The court granted the king a pardon for his age and declared him of age, as they say.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, guardians were appointed as if he were a minor. The counselors who refused to condemn Admiral and his brother Andelot were thrown into prison. These are signs of utter desperation.</p>
      <p>Against Lyon, Duke Nemours now attempts nothing by force and arms, because he hopes it will be gradually overcome by hunger and a shortage of all things. Baron Adrets, who had previously conducted himself vigorously, was enticed by his blandishments and admitted him as governor, but, overcome by the consensus of the nobles and cities, he desisted. If Vienne, as we hope, is soon recovered, the region of the Occitan language, which today abounds in wheat and wine, will supply ample provisions. A troop of cavalry, which had been sent by the prince towards Lyon, was intercepted.</p>
      <p>We now have good hopes for Baron Adrets, and he has promised to be obedient to good and sound advice. Certainly, he had erred not out of treachery but out of foolish credulity.</p>
      <p>If Cursol, whom the cities of the Occitan language have appointed as governor, seriously bites the bit, the people of Lyon will be out of danger. I fear that Count Beauvais, who was formerly Cardinal of Castiglione, is too slow and delays him with his procrastination. Regarding the Turkish embassy, Sulcerus wrote the same as you, but the rumor was fabricated.</p>
      <p>Our friend Dr. Passius, formerly the bishop of Nevers, was at Frankfurt, sent as an envoy by Prince Condé to the Emperor and the princes. Since he had not informed me, I thought the matter was vain.</p>
      <p>But now he himself has arrived and confirms that it is nothing. He recounted how kindly he was received by the emperor, and how much goodwill the King of the Romans showed, who lamented the dissipation of France in his presence, especially because the enemies are plotting the destruction of the pure religion.</p>
      <p>Regarding the changed form of the oath, I believe the form has been conveyed to you. For he promised to be a defender not of the Roman but of the Christian church, then omitted the saints and saintesses, content with the name of the one God. In the Council of Trent, you will recognize from his speech what role Cardinal Lorraine played, to which the king's envoy, the notorious apostate, then assented. Although the copies are faulty, you will easily perceive that they are very perplexed, and find no other outcome than that religion should be free in France.</p>
      <p>I am sending back the copies of the letters I had written to the Poles: because the second response, in which I had explained the question quite fully, was lost, I refrain from dealing with that matter. I suspect it was lost due to Beza's negligence or forgetfulness.</p>
      <p>I wish to hear something more cheerful about your health. God keeps me bound in chains.</p>
      <p>The acute pains have indeed ceased, but I can barely crawl from the bed to the table through the room. Today I gave a sermon, but I was carried into the temple.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man and brother, to be cherished from the heart. I pray for much health for the fellow ministers and brothers.</p>
      <p>My colleagues and all friends greet you: among others, the scribe whose hand you recognize, may the Lord keep you safe for a long time, sustain you with virtue, and bless your labors. Geneva, December 27, 1563.</p>
      <p>What you wished for me to meet with Brenz, I cannot do at this time. Other studies are so pressing.</p>
      <p>If a little more leisure occurs, a favorable opportunity is now offered, because the ministers under the rule of the Counts of Mansfeld have urged the French to repentance in a tasteless pamphlet, whom they recognize and name as brothers except for this one point. If I am relieved a little from other occupations and the illness also gives some relaxation, I will attempt something. Brenz's error can be briefly refuted, because the principle he takes from the immensity of the glory and power of Christ is wrongly applied to the essence of the body. Certainly, the hinge turns on this: although the flesh of Christ is in heaven, yet we are truly fed by it on earth, because Christ, by the immense power of his spirit and diffused everywhere, makes himself ours in such a way that he dwells in us without changing place. In this question, it has always been enough for me to exclude both immensity and local descent or presence; for I see no absurdity if we say that we truly and really receive the flesh and blood of Christ and that they are substantially our nourishment, provided it agrees that Christ descends to us not only by external symbols but also by the secret operation of his spirit, so that we may ascend to him by faith. Your John Calvin.</p>
