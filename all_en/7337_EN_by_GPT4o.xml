      <p>I kindly ask you, dear Mr. Tobias, to intercede with my esteemed lords, the mayors Willy or Tscharner, or wherever you think it is appropriate, so that they may assist me in ensuring that this letter, written to Johann Wilhelm Stucki, is sent to Padua in the Venetian territory through their acquaintances and good friends. And if they do not know anything specific, I have written to Mr. Franz Ponet, a merchant, and requested that he send the letter for me. Therefore, if my esteemed lords do not know, please ask them to assist you in ensuring that both letters, to Ponet and Stucki, are sent as quickly as possible, and let me know how you have arranged it.</p>
      <p>God be with you, and do not be angry that I trouble you so; I will, where I can, also serve you.</p>
      <p>To my Tobias Egli.</p>
