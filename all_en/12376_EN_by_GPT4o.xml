    <p xml:id="regest1">That Borrhaus admonished Bullinger regarding [Kaspar] Schwenckfeld, he can justify with a clear conscience. He had only one aim: to advocate for harmony among those destined for the Kingdom of Heaven. Therefore, he does not need to further apologize in this regard; however, he would like to clarify here that, contrary to Bullinger's opinion, he is not secretly mediating for Schwenckfeld in the dispute over the [human nature] of Christ. For sixteen years, he has had no contact with him, nor has Schwenckfeld asked him to intervene as an arbitrator. Rather, Schwenckfeld regards him as an opponent and not as a friend. So, if he wrote to [the Zurichers] [HBBW XV, No. 2254], it was on his own initiative as well as that of a friend [Jakob Held?] (who appreciates both Schwenckfeld and the Zurichers).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Should Schwenckfeld indeed think that the human nature and its properties in the glorified Christ are suppressed or even absorbed by the divine nature, one would rightly have to be wary of Schwenckfeld's doctrine. But if the view he holds of the dignity and power of the glorified human Christ is in accordance with the Holy Scripture, without nullifying or weakening either nature of Christ, Bullinger would need to change his stance towards Schwenckfeld. Bullinger will probably not deny that in the current dispute, much has been claimed that is more due to linguistic misunderstandings than to incompatible content, and that the disputants may not have properly understood what the other side really thinks. Bullinger will also know how much the emotions impair the judgment of the opponents; the saying of [Publilius Syrus], "In much strife, the truth is lost," is well known! Therefore, those who dispute over divine matters should be wary of themselves, especially since [Paul] also warns against "word quarrels" and complicated debates (as can sometimes be found with Schwenckfeld).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- It offends Borrhaus that Bullinger compares Bucer's failed attempts to mediate between the Zurichers and Luther with his own efforts. It was not his goal to mediate between the Zurichers and Schwenckfeld. Moreover, he would have refrained from such an attempt because he was aware that it might upset others. Borrhaus only wanted to offer Bullinger the opportunity to participate in resolving a dispute harmful to the Church. He himself was ready to contribute in this direction, especially since he heard that Schwenckfeld offered to present his views in a peaceful manner. Even if Schwenckfeld were as Bullinger describes, it would nonetheless have been Borrhaus' duty to inform his friend Bullinger about Schwenckfeld's intentions. But if Bullinger's judgment of Schwenckfeld is not accurate, Borrhaus has fulfilled the role of a peacemaker, which is the duty of every righteous person.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The Zurichers must now see for themselves what they could do in favor of harmony. As for Bucer and his peace efforts, God will judge. Borrhaus, for his part, can only rejoice that he is in accordance with God-pleasing advice. The Zurichers should not be displeased with him either, if they judge him correctly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- His concern is to give the human nature of Christ, which was raised to the right hand of God, the same honor as the almighty wise Father; an honor of which the resurrected Christ himself testified when he said: "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me."</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Borrhaus' concern is also that people endowed with the spiritual gifts of God are truly appreciated. Bullinger and his colleagues are among these people; perhaps Schwenckfeld as well. If this is the case, Christ [also] will be revealed to the world through Schwenckfeld. If not, one should pray for him.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. What I have advised about Schwenckfeld, dear Bullinger, I believe to be such matters in which I can satisfy both my conscience regarding good faith and you regarding sincere intent. For I have desired nothing other than to reconcile harmony among those whom the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ has inscribed in the one kingdom of heavenly tranquility; which I knew would be both an ornament to the pious and necessary in this confusion of times. Therefore, I do not think I need to labor greatly to excuse myself to you in these matters I wrote about Schwenckfeld. Rather, I consider it necessary to take pains to clear myself of the suspicion that you think I wanted to act as a mediator in his name. You complain that Schwenckfeld uses me familiarly, as if I were appointed by him as an arbitrator in this very dispute and cause concerning the flesh of Christ. You are mistaken here, if I may say so with your permission, my Bullinger. For neither does he use me familiarly, with whom I have had no association of life or letters for more than sixteen years, nor has he ever asked me to interpose myself as an arbitrator in such a grave controversy, but rather, believe me, he has regarded me as suspect, more as an adversary than as a faithful friend to whom he would entrust his matters. Therefore, what I wrote to you about this man, I wrote of my own accord and at the request of a certain friend, who is devoted to both of you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Therefore, if what Schwenckfeld holds singularly about the origin of the flesh of Christ and its transformation to the glory of the divine nature are such that they seem to either abolish the human nature and its properties, which necessarily follow it, or rashly mix both natures with each other, this doctrine would indeed be worthy of abhorrence by all the pious. But if what he teaches about the glorified flesh of Christ, now exalted to the majesty of the Father, proclaims the dignity and amplitude according to the sense of the Holy Scripture and in agreement with the analogy of faith, with neither nature abolished nor both disturbed with each other, you yourself will be able to judge what should be decided here, and I think you will not deny that many things could have been thrown around in this controversy during the disputation, which clashed more in the contention of words than in the matter itself. And although it has been contested with great forces in this cause by both parties, I do not think it will follow that both clearly know what the other thinks. For you yourself, as a man skilled in these matters, understand well enough what emotions can do in a fight, how they sometimes disturb true judgment and cast the mind down from its position, from which spectators, when they are free, often weigh the matter more sharply and judge more truly than those who are involved in the struggle and dust. For it is well known, as the comic says: "In too much arguing, the truth is lost." Therefore, it will have been more necessary for those who wish to contend about sacred matters to bring a mind free from ambition, hatred, envy, the desire for revenge, and the desire to win, which almost always falls into the greatest minds. For unless we are cautious in this matter, so that the truth, which we have undertaken to defend, is purely defended, it can in no way be done, but from there arise word quarrels and obscure disputes, which I reproach somewhere in Schwenckfeld.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>As for what you write that you are reminded by my letters of that composition, in which Bucer played a role as mediator between Luther and you, I must admit, I took it somewhat gravely. For I never assumed for myself the task of reconciling you, as I was not asked by anyone to attempt it. And being aware of my own limitations, I willingly abstain from such matters, in which there is a certain danger of undermining grace, with no gain. But in my letters, I only aimed to advise you on how you might, with your prudence, foresee how the recent disturbance could be settled in time, lest it spread more widely and become greater than would be convenient for both your churches and others. For this purpose, if it seemed so, I would also apply my effort and zeal to the best of my ability, as I had heard that Schwenckfeld desired nothing more than to be given a place where he could calmly and peacefully give an account of his entire doctrine. If this is the disposition of the man, as I wrote, I think I had a just occasion to advise you on this matter, especially as my friend and bishop of your church, whose interest it is to know and judge these matters. But if the disposition of that man was less than what was proclaimed, my zeal for peace and glorifying Christ with a concordant mind frees me from any deceit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>But since I have left all reason and counsel for establishing harmony under the word to you, I should not be accused of any unfair composition than I have presumed in my mind. If Bucer lost his effort and expense among you as an inauspicious mediator of repairing harmony, he will find his judge, before whom he will give an account of his endeavors. As for me, I rejoice to be conscious of those counsels that are approved by the Lord; and they cannot displease you either, if you wish to judge truly of my mind.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>For I strive that the human nature of Christ, exalted to the throne at the right hand of God, be attributed equal glory of wisdom and power as the Father, as this very nature, now raised from the dead, attributes to itself with these words: "All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me," and that there be nothing good in that august kingdom which the human nature in Christ does not possess from the royal and priestly anointing of the holy spirit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Then my endeavor is that those whom the spirit of God the Father in Christ, the head of all spiritual perfection, adorns with divine gifts, be sincerely loved. Among these, as I recognize you and yours, dearest Bullinger, I venerate you as ministers of the gospel and love you as brothers. As for Schwenckfeld, if he thinks rightly, I consider the Lord to be proclaimed in him; if not, I will pray to Christ that he may return to the way and be reconciled with good men. This will be the reason for both avoiding and embracing this man, as Christ teaches.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, with all the brothers there, whom you will kindly greet in my name.</p>
      <p>In the year 46, on the second day of Epiphany.</p>
      <p>Martin Borrhaus.</p>
