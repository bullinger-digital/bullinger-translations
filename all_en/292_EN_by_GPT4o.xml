      <p>Greetings in the Lord, I believe you have received the letters sent through Ulrich, who was carrying grain, in which you will see what is happening in the lower regions. Brentius came to us on October 1st, having been kept for a long time by Duke Ulrich in the castle of Urach; he was provided with his own courier and a horse. He will stay with us through the winter until he is recalled by the prince. Our bishop has called all the priests to a synod in Altkirch to present them with the Emperor's decree and to exact money; they deserve a greater punishment and fine.</p>
      <p>Brentius told us various things about the state of Germany, which I cannot explain now due to business, but I will discuss this matter another time.</p>
      <p>Jodocus Willichius wrote to me: "Islebius is causing us a lot of trouble because of the Interimists, who are called so because of the Interim; he tries to defend it with a milder interpretation, but in some matters, he advises turning a blind eye. However, there is no one who obeys his advice and pleas, along with his prince.</p>
      <p>So far, the princes in our regions remain steadfast by the grace of God and are not moved by the Emperor's threats. Magdeburg, already well fortified, is expecting a siege; but now, by publishing a German pamphlet, they reveal their innocence to everyone. There is a new confederation among the maritime cities against the decision and edict of the Emperor; for they prefer to obey God even at the risk of their lives.</p>
      <p>Sarmatia, our neighbor, has adorned its churches with evangelical reformation. In Danzig, too, the gospel is preached holy and pure. The Muscovites are attempting the same in their region. God will undoubtedly protect His church as the apple of His eye.</p>
      <p>Silesia still professes the purity of Christian theology. Wrocław fears somewhat for itself because of Ferdinand's intrigues.</p>
      <p>There is now a convention in Piotrków in Poland for the restoration of purer doctrine, which is already completed in Lithuania. In Vilnius, which is the capital of that region and where there is a mix of many nations, the gospel is proclaimed from the public pulpit by learned doctors; for the young King Sigismund Augustus fervently favors the piety of the doctrine. This is what Willichius wrote on the Friday after St. Lawrence's Day, 1548, in Frankfurt on the Oder. Three academies refuse to accept the Interim: Leipzig, Frankfurt, and Wittenberg; the scholars are unanimous in this matter and oppose all who have papist sentiments. May the Lord be with them in spirit of strength and enlighten their hearts so that they may think piously and not deviate from the truth.</p>
      <p>Brentius was called by the people of Magdeburg to be the pastor of their churches, but he has not yet given a response; he wants to finish his homilies on Isaiah and some other things first; for they will be useful to the sad and afflicted churches.</p>
      <p>There is something else I would like from you; I hear that you have given a public speech in which you refute all the articles of the lost Interim; I would love to read it and absorb those arguments and add my own.</p>
      <p>Brentius is staying in the house of the late Grynaeus with the widow, who has taken him in as a housemate. He has a very convenient place, suitable for his studies, with a very well-equipped library. Farewell. Please greet all the brothers in my name, Dr. Theodor, to whom I will write shortly, Pellican, Gwalther, etc.</p>
      <p>Basel, October 3, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius. Dr. Peter Tussanus, who arrived while I was writing this, asked me to add his greetings to you and all the brothers in his name. He tells favorable things about his prince Christopher, who approves the Interim in such a way that he does not lose Christ and does not obscure His merit. I wish to know where Dr. Musculus is, and it is surprising that he left Basel and Dr. Hervagius, with whom he could have lived very comfortably with his wife and children.</p>
      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most steadfast herald of evangelical truth. Zurich.</p>
