      <p>To the Reverend man and most renowned in all kinds of learning, Mr. Philipp Melanchthon, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother, H. Bullinger sends greetings. Reverend man, most esteemed lord, and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>In these days, I have received three letters from your kindness, more precious and dearer than any excellent matters. In the first, you indicate that you have received my Apocalypse with a kind spirit and have examined the place concerning Gog and Magog, and will soon consider how I accommodate the series of the whole book to the times and to the various struggles of the church. I indeed congratulate myself not a little, that I have not only pleased such a great man by submitting this book, but also gained a reader who undoubtedly observed diligently those things which seemed to be indicated by a friend to a friend and brother. I also pray you, dearest brother, to freely write to me your judgment about those labors of mine, especially concerning chapters 4 and 5, 9, 13, 17, and 20. Otherwise, I would not wish to cause you any trouble, being so occupied, nor do I expect lengthy letters, but only brief ones, in which you explain your opinion in a few words. Concerning my son Heinrich, about whom you wish me to write to you, I have nothing certain, except that I hear he has gone to Vienna in Austria, from where I am recalling him home with written letters. I give immortal thanks to your piety for the benefits bestowed upon him.</p>
      <p>In your later letters, you recommended to me the excellent man Mr. Tilmann Mumer from Cologne, whom I received with as much kindness as I could and did what I could for him, both because of the love and hospitality which Christ our Lord requires from us, and because of your recommendation, which I rightly hold in the highest regard. However, it pains me that I could not confer greater services upon him.</p>
      <p>He himself will explain the rest.</p>
      <p>In your last letters, you tell me a truly unfortunate matter, namely that our brothers, your colleagues, after having deposited the condemnation of our churches with the president of the colloquy, have separated themselves from you and departed. Indeed, that condemnation, by which they condemned us, does not make us very anxious, as we are well aware of ourselves before our Lord God and before His holy church. What pains us more is their imprudence and inflexible and unfortunate obstinacy, which, unless the Lord prevents it, has laid the unfortunate beginnings of great struggles even among yourselves, to both cheer and strengthen our enemies, and to gravely wound the weak consciences of many. We acknowledge that we owe much to you and the other brothers and give you immortal thanks, who did not wish to consent to the unprecedented condemnation of us and our churches. We accept all the canonical scriptures and their catholic and orthodox sense. We accept the Apostles' Creed, the Nicene Creed, and also the Athanasian, Constantinopolitan, Ephesian, and Chalcedonian Creeds. We abhor all heresies and heretics condemned by the authority of the scriptures by the church. We invoke one only God the Father, through His only-begotten Son Jesus Christ, the mediator and intercessor of the human race with the Father. Him alone we adore and worship; we abhor all superstition and idolatry.</p>
      <p>We confess that all men are corrupted by original sin and liable to damnation, but are liberated and sanctified by the grace of God alone through the blood of Jesus Christ. We believe that we are justified by faith alone, not by any works, so that God does not impute our sins to us, but imputes the righteousness of His Son to us. We say that truly good works are neither useless nor to be rejected if they are done by the saints from faith, although we do not attribute justification to them. We retain in our churches sacred assemblies, legitimate ministry, the reading of sacred scriptures, public and private prayers, repentance, and discipline with catechism and schools. We acknowledge the magistracy as a good and necessary ordinance of God and abhor all seditions and tumults. We believe marriage to be holy, but we abhor monasticism and all impurities.</p>
      <p>We confess the sacraments of Christ, holy baptism, and the mystical supper of our Lord to be divine symbols of the grace announced by the gospel and seals of the righteousness of faith, which have other purposes as we have explained. And although we have hitherto opposed and still oppose the bread-worship and that corporeal and thus papistic presence of the precious body and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ in the bread and the promiscuous eating in the holy supper, we have never denied that Christ is present to His faithful who legitimately celebrate the supper, we have never asserted that the symbols are empty and profane, we have never denied that the true flesh of the Lord and His true blood are true food and drink, which are otherwise spiritually perceived by true faith by the saints unto eternal life. To this, we have never reached such obstinacy that we were unwilling to hear, learn, and accept better things from the scriptures. And although there have been some disputes between us and some Saxons, as the books published on both sides testify, we have never renounced friendship and brotherhood with them, we have never repudiated them as enemies and persecuted them. What we have written against them, we have written compelled by a certain necessity, nor do we in the churches, in which the Lord has willed us to minister, pursue, accuse, and condemn either the blessed memory of Mr. Luther or the churches of Saxony or even their ministers in public sermons, as we hear it has been received among them against us. Rather, we have made honorable mention of them when the opportunity is given, and we testify that we are sincerely grieved that the sacramentarian contention has been stirred up, which we would prefer to be settled in a Christian manner, and if nothing else can be obtained, we would at least wish that peace be maintained and cultivated on both sides until the Lord grants greater and better things.</p>
      <p>What then do those good brothers condemn in us, why do they persecute their friends, why do they join themselves to common enemies? I beseech you by Christ, my lord and brother, that, since you understand, by the excellent gifts you have received from God, where the iniquity and obstinacy of our brothers tend, you interpose your authority, which is very great among the pious, and openly and clearly explain to the pious and holy, who uniquely expect this from you, what they should follow in this contention, lest many through imprudent zeal defile themselves, while they hate and turn away from and even persecute those who have deserved no evil and assert the truth.</p>
      <p>Moses, a great man in the house of God, did not disdain to join himself to his afflicted and endangered brothers. A short time remains, in which we are still to live in this world; that day of the Lord is pressing upon us, nor will the powerful and good Lord ever be lacking to those who are upright in heart and call upon the Lord in truth, etc. Would that we might obtain, that you, excellent Philipp, before you return to Saxony, might see and embrace us at Zürich, that you might visit us who are most loving of you. This we ask of you and strive for with the greatest of all prayers.</p>
      <p>Come, come, longed-for brother.</p>
      <p>We will accompany you some way towards your homeland.</p>
      <p>May the Lord protect you and bless you all, which we ask of Him with perpetual prayers. May the Lord preserve you in the midst of a crooked nation.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell always happily.</p>
      <p>All the brothers and fellow ministers greet you, Gwalther, Wolf, Bibliander, Martyr, Gessner, Lavater, Haller, Wiccius, Zwingli, Simler, Frisius, Ammianus, Collinus, and all the others. Commend us to our brothers, your colleagues, Mr. Brenz, Pistorius, and all the others, whom you will greet most amicably. Zürich, October 27, 1557.</p>
      <p>I sent these letters to Worms through Mr. Dr. Johann Eewych from Jülich, a doctor of medicine, coming from Padua, and through Mr. Tilmann Mumer from Cologne, who brought letters from Philipp.</p>
