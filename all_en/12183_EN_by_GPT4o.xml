    <p xml:id="regest1">Amerbach recently received Bullinger's [“Orthodox Confession of the Zurich Church”] against Luther's [“Short Confession”]. Even though he had no time to read the writing, he does not doubt that it shows the usual scholarship and piety of Bullinger's other works. Such disputes pain him greatly, yet he admits that [the people of Zurich] were forced to defend their honor. May Christ cause that, just as there is only one faith and one baptism, people unite in harmony and seek only what is His! Bullinger must not doubt Amerbach's grateful disposition; he can expect anything from him. Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, [Theodor] Bibliander, and the others.</p>

      <p>Greetings and Peace. I recently received your booklet, most learned Bullinger, in which you refute Dr. Luther's accusations with the confession of your church. Although I have not yet had the leisure to read it, I have no doubt that it is a genuine work and indeed bears the mark of the scholarship and piety of your other writings. It pains me greatly that such disputes provide ample material for many to slander and mock. But what can I do against necessity, when I see you driven to defend and protect both your own reputation and that of your church with this, as if it were the last and greatest weapon? May Christ the Savior grant that, just as there is one faith and one baptism, we may at last, imbued with His most holy spirit, unite in harmony and, setting aside our own desires, seek what is His! I thank you immensely for the booklet you sent and I ask you not to doubt that I have a grateful heart for the gifts received and a willingness to reciprocate and show gratitude, although I am not quite sure how to accomplish what I have long been contemplating. In short: you should confidently expect anything from me, whom you will find everywhere to be a most devoted admirer of your name and a sincere herald of your virtues. Farewell, most learned man. On the seventeenth day before the Kalends of May, in the year 1545, in Basel. You will respectfully greet the most distinguished gentlemen Pellikan, Bibliander, and the others in my name. Yours sincerely, Bonifacius Amerbachius</p>
