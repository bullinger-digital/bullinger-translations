      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I received your second letter after the first (most Christian man), to which I responded three days ago. But because they might be delivered more slowly by the courier, I wanted to inform you again that I have satisfied both the pharmacist's importunity and others, and no one, unless he is foolish, will bother you about this matter or any other with me intervening, knowing that you are otherwise very busy with far greater and better matters.</p>
      <p>I would gladly see what you wrote to the Genevans regarding the case of the heresiarch Servetus, as our Vergerius advised me. I hear nothing more about anyone murmuring about him. I have nothing new worthy of your attention. Farewell. From Basel, on the third day before the Nones of November 1553.</p>
      <p>[Yours, if anyone's,] Wilhelm Gratarol, physician. To the best master Bullinger, pastor, etc., in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
