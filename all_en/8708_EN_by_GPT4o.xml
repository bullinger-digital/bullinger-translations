      <p> Greetings. I received everything you recently sent to KÃ¼ngsfeld, namely the Wittenberg Catechism and the other booklet attached to it. I had seen these before; but since you wish me to keep them, I thank you as much as I can. I also saw what the Wittenbergers wrote to you, in which matter I not only congratulate you all, but I praise the most good and great God and cannot marvel enough at His wonderful works, who has made these bitter waters of Jericho so sweet. We have nothing new, except that favorable news is being announced to us from France. I saw letters from the Admiral and the Queen of Navarre to Beza, in which only good and favorable things are reported. It is also said that the king wrote intercessory letters to the Duke of Savoy on behalf of his subjects, who, having aided the evangelicals in the past war in France, were deprived of their goods by the Duke. The king now commends them to the Duke as his greatest friends and wants their possessions to be restored to them. We do not believe the victory of the Venetians is as great as they boast it to be, and even if it is so great, we fear that the most ferocious enemy will take even graver revenge. The Genevans and the Savoyard envoys have been here for a long time; but what has been done or concluded, I do not know at all, except that I hear it has been about the scarcity of provisions, which the Genevans suffer because the Duke has forbidden his people to transport anything there or to have any trade with them because of the plague. He uses this as a pretext. They can no longer bear this, and many fear that some tumult may arise from it, indeed they think that if the Genevans had as many Frenchmen with them as they once had, they would break out and take grain for themselves by force. The Savoyards show themselves to be very harsh here; our people, however, interpose their authority with the prince; but they have not yet received any response; for the matter was left unresolved. You know, of course, what other disturbances have arisen in Geneva among the ministers, so that Ganeus fled to France; Coladon, after being detained in court for some time, was also deprived of his office. Ganeus, having recently returned from France, summoned Beza to a meeting at the Arve bridge not far from the city. Beza went out; but since he did not want to cross the bridge and enter the Duke's territory, and Ganeus likewise did not want to commit himself to the land of the Genevans, they parted without a meeting. I am once again going out and performing my duty again by the grace of the Lord. I have nothing else to write now, and I am also brief because of the market day occupations; therefore, I will write more next time. </p>
      <p> Our consuls and treasurers greet you, as well as all friends and brothers, especially our Samuel Telamon and Blasius, my son-in-law, who were with me while I wrote this. </p>
      <p> Farewell. Greet all yours in my name. Bern, November 12, 1571. </p>
      <p> Especially Diesbach. </p>
      <p> Johannes Haller, always yours. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot. </p>
      <p> Zurich. </p>
