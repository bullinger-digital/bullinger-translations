      <p> Greetings. I recently wrote about the election of our deacon, who barely surpassed Musculus by two votes. All the good and sensible people, who have some brains, stood on our side, and there have been great disturbances in the city because of this election, with some approving it and others disapproving it. Most of the senators gave their votes to Musculus; but the multitude of the ignorant common people prevailed. Musculus himself was summoned to the senate and severely admonished to beware of Buceranism; thus, he seems to lower his crest somewhat, so I think he will be peaceful. I only fear that Weber and he, who are both quite vehement, may not be able to remain in agreement. However, there is another thing that also comforts me not a little in this matter, namely the election of Michael Schlatter; for he has been appointed as a substitute for the deacon, although not yet completely confirmed; for he will first preach here for a few weeks. I do not doubt, however, that both his doctrine and speech will be approved by all, as he speaks very eloquently and clearly. I am now moving into the house of Jodocus by order of the senate; although I am leaving more elegant ones, because these are parochial, they have therefore been assigned to me. </p>
      <p> I think Musculus will move into mine. </p>
      <p> As for new matters, we have absolutely nothing; I wish to know something from you and learn. Almost my entire family is suffering from a cough, and the youngest infant most of all, so that I almost despair of his life. May the Lord preserve him mercifully! Musculus with his family, and also my wife, send many greetings to you and yours. Farewell well. </p>
      <p> Bern, December 2, 1552. </p>
      <p> Yours, Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his honorable lord and compatriot. </p>
