      <p>Greetings. Lord Richard Hilles, an Englishman, promised a month ago in good faith to send my letters to you. If you have received them, all is well; if not, I hope you will receive them. I ask that you do not attribute the interruption of letters to either ingratitude or forgetfulness, but to serious and grave matters, by which I am perpetually distracted, and to other reasons, which I withhold until the time comes when I can more freely correspond with you. I know that you are expecting a response to your requests, which you have earnestly asked for in your letters; wait a little while: it is enough if you obtain what you desire, as well as you wish. If you have the Decades, which many pious people expect from you at each fair, prepared for the press, I ask that you dedicate them to the Duke of Northumberland; he loves you greatly and diligently promotes the glory of Christ. I left Master Martyr on the 20th of this February in Oxford, suffering from a fever; may the Lord be with him and restore him to health. His wife passed away on the 16th of this month. My wife, along with my entire family, sends greetings to your excellency. In my name and hers, you will greet yours, and we pray for all good things for your sons and daughters.</p>
      <p>Greet Lord Consul, Lord Bibliander, Lord Gwalter, Lord Pellican, with their spouses, Lord Butler and his.</p>
      <p>London, the last day of February, 1553.</p>
      <p>Always most devoted to you, John Hooper, Bishop of Worcester and Gloucester.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most pious and vigilant overseer of the church in ZÃ¼rich, and his most beloved compatriot.</p>
