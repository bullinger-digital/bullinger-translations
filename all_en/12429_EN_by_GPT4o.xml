    <p xml:id="regest1">Hochholzer does not want to delay Bullinger, who is burdened with more and more work, with many words. He and his colleagues were pleased with Bullinger's letter [not preserved].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Hopefully now, after Luther's death, the prudent and faithful [Philipp] Melanchthon will reform what serves the restoration of truth and the strengthening of church unity according to the apostolic rule.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger should send Hochholzer his notes on Theodor [Bibliander's] Genesis lectures through the [letter carrier, the Aarau] bookseller [Hans Stuber]. Hochholzer would return them after a few days. However, if Bullinger cannot spare the entire volume even for a short time, Hochholzer asks for the corresponding notes of [Rudolf] Gwalther. Hochholzer would have written to him if he were not convinced that Bullinger would lend him his notes. Hochholzer plans to preach on the Book of Genesis. For this ambitious endeavor, he is willing to spare no effort. Perhaps he will even achieve more success than before, although he has already earned some praise from the church.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings to Gwalther, to the other [colleagues], and to Bullinger's family. Hochholzer's wife [Agathe, née Näf] also sends her regards to Bullinger's family.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Since I am aware that you are increasingly burdened with business daily, my esteemed lord and father, I do not wish to be verbose, especially as there is nothing particular to write to you about. Your recent letter was very delightful not only to me but also to other brothers.</p>

      <p>We hear that Luther has died. We hope that with his passing, Melanchthon, with his unique prudence, faith, and sincerity, will now do much to restore the light of truth and strengthen the unity of the church, which he has so far, as a faithful steward in the house of the Lord, either borne or overlooked according to the needs of the time, and will reform it according to the apostolic rule.</p>

      <p>But you yourself have long known what he is like. I will omit this. I now come to that clause, which I always or mostly use when I write to you, namely, to ask something from you; and I do this with more confidence, as I am more certain that you will deny me nothing due to your usual humanity and kindness towards me. I therefore ask, if it can be done with your peace, that you send to me through our bookseller, what you have collected recently in the lectures of Theodor on Genesis. I will return them to you after a very few days, postponing all other matters. But if you cannot spare the entire volume for a few days, I would like to have the collections of Mr. Gwalther from the same lectures, to whom I would have written about the same matter, if I had not been convinced that you would give me yours. If it can be done, I ask as much as possible that you do not want to fail me in this as in other matters so far. For I have decided to explain Genesis to the church for public sermons to the best of my ability. I am attempting great things. However, I will spare no effort with the Lord's help for the gift granted to me by the Lord's generous kindness. I will do what I can, as I have done so far, and perhaps now with more success, although I have worked in the vineyard of the Lord with the grace of God present, so that, if I have not deserved the greatest praises, I have nevertheless obtained not the least in the judgment of the church.</p>

      <p>More is not allowed now due to the shortness of time, nor does the matter require it. Farewell in the Lord. Give my greetings to Mr. Gwalther and the others and to your whole family, whom my wife also wishes well. Aarau, March 17, 1546.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your humanity, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Zurich church, as to a father to be greatly honored.</p>
