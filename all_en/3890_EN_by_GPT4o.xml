      <p>Greetings. A booklet against the Bavarian articles was presented to me, most honorable Bullinger, which I received with open arms, worthy of great reverence in itself. Our marshal is grieved that he has no copy; it will be your task to send copies for him and his friends. The diet is in the state I previously described to you; there was a long debate on whether to hear the French envoys, and there were those who thought they should not be heard, namely so that they would not have an offended France as an enemy nor would France be a refuge for the afflicted in the future; but after much discussion, it was decided that they would be heard. Meanwhile, nothing has been done in the imperial senate.</p>
      <p>The merchants consistently affirm that a truce for three years has been made between the Turk and the emperor, which the imperialists deny. If a truce has been made, it will be difficult for the Austrian to obtain money.</p>
      <p>Nothing certain is yet known about the peace between Philipp and the French. There are few envoys here, and besides the bishops and the Bavarian prince, none; he who offers you these things knows much.</p>
      <p>Let me know if the booklet on papal sects has been presented to you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly, March 12, in the year 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Gereon.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my dear lord and brother.</p>
