    <p xml:id="regest1">Praises Gervasius Schuler, who was unanimously elected as pastor in Memmingen and is now returning to Switzerland for a short time. Kaspar von Schwenckfeld has published a booklet "On the Edification of Conscience," with which he intends to deceive the simple believers. Therefore, he also seeks the friendship of the Evangelicals, although he is actually an enemy of unity. It is to be feared that he will spread his "sweet poison" not only in Augsburg but also in Swabia; vigilance is necessary! Blarer expects more information about Schwenckfeld from Hans Friedrich Thumb von Neuburg. Bullinger's manuscript "De Testamento" was very well received. Greetings. Concern about the peace agreement in Solothurn, which is unfavorable for the Evangelicals. In response to Bullinger's words of thanks, Blarer expresses his gratitude for all the benefits he has received, especially for Bullinger's gift to his sister Margaretha. Schuler should manage better, his patrons wish it.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>Here returns to you again our Gervasius, dearest Bullinger, who was recently sent here by you and, after having delivered more or less six sermons to our church, was dispatched to Memmingen with many of my commendatory letters. He then, with his rare grace of speech and learned eloquence, in which he is second to hardly anyone, and with his innocence of character, so commended himself there that he was soon unanimously elected as bishop of the church by common vote and with one voice of all. Returning, he brought back to me no fewer letters, most candidly proclaiming his praise, than he had received from me to be delivered there. They certainly believe not now because of my speech, but because they themselves saw and heard this divine instrument, and they, affirming themselves bound to me by this new and great benefit, give greater thanks, because by my effort such a sacred overseer has befallen them, although it is also fair that they attribute this great good to you, who first indicated to me this truly excellent little man. Thanks be to God, who has so kindly provided for the church of Memmingen and for Gervasius, whose affairs were almost returning to famine. He himself will tell you better how the rest has been accomplished.</p>
      <p>About Schwenckfeld, my brother, your mind has foreseen what the matter is. I dare to call this man a most harmful pest of Christian simplicity and unity, and one who is most apt to deceive and bewilder with his uncommon gifts and insidious flattery. He has now published a booklet, which he has titled "On the Edification of Conscience and the Increase of Faith," seemingly more than Christian. For it seems to breathe nothing but Christ and a life worthy of Him. But oh, the most cunning fox, lying in wait with marvelous arts for the evangelical hen, which officiously gathers her chicks under her wings, until he seeks the throat. Thus he paves the way for himself to the minds of the simple, so that, gradually confirmed by the persuasion of sound doctrine, he may later impose his poisonous dogmas with greater authority and disturb concord. In this, too, he so eagerly seeks the friendships of our people, that relying on them, he may be less suspected by them and impose on the less prudent with less difficulty, while in truth he agrees with no one and acknowledges no church of Christ either among us or among the Anabaptists or among the Papists, and there is no congregation of Christ's faithful anywhere with whom he wishes to break Christ's bread. He is still acting in Augsburg and finds there those who greatly admire and venerate him, lest anywhere his lid should be missing for his pot. However, I fear that having set out from there to Swabia, he may also offer his sweet poison there, as he is wont to spew this poison of his everywhere. May Christ, the best and greatest savior, timely ward off with His mighty hand these wild beasts grazing on His vineyard and make us more vigilant, the more serious and present are the dangers of thieves and robbers!</p>
      <p>I grieve more than I can write, and indeed it grieves me most that I cannot sufficiently grieve for the church of God, except that it consoles me in the meantime that this church, resting on its foundation, cannot be shaken by the winds of foreign doctrines from the right nor by the storms of persecutions from the left. I was about to send some Schwenckfeldian writings, but the noble Friedrich Thumb von Neuburg, to whom Schwenckfeld, after having feigned and dissembled everything, mixed the poison with the most subtle reasoning, has not yet returned them, so that he almost drew him away from our people, and I had to timely remedy it. As soon as I receive them, I will ensure that you have them.</p>
      <p>What you recently sent through our Gervasius, written "On the One Testament," was very well received. Let me know whether they should be returned to you or whether you wish me to keep them. If you permit the latter, you will have me bound by a doubled benefit, both for what you sent and for relieving me of the labor of copying, and you will in turn feel our gratitude as soon as some occasion arises. May Christ, for whom your studies sweat with such great success, keep you safe for us and His church for as long as possible. To Him, we also diligently commend you with pious prayers.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you, especially my wife, sister, and cousin, who also ordered me to write greetings to your most holy wife. Many commend themselves to you in Zurich with my brother. To Pellican, the most sincere and best man, to Leo, the holy and truly learned brother, to Theodor, the incomparable young man, and equally to those two most courteous men, your companions, Utinger and Wernher, make sure to convey our many greetings and commend us to them accurately.</p>
      <p>We hear that the internal dissension of the Solothurners has been somewhat settled, but on unfair terms. As for our people, prudent men truly fear that this evil may soon break out again. May the Lord firmly and perpetually bind your people with the bond of His peace and the ties of true charity!</p>
      <p>Farewell, my soul.</p>
      <p>Constance, December 2, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To what end, Bullinger, at the end of your letter, do you so anxiously give us thanks, as if indeed we had bestowed any office or benefit upon you worthy of your humanity, learning, and piety, and that of those who were present with you, as if finally you had not abundantly returned thanks with your most elegant gift, with which you so magnificently adorned our sister, that the burden of giving and returning thanks now inclines upon us?</p>
      <p>Remind Gervasius to be a little more attentive to the matter than he has been, or certainly to entrust the entire management of the household to his wife. For although they otherwise favor the man exceedingly, yet they desire many things in him.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious bishop of the church of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable brother in Christ.</p>
