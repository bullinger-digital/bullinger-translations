    <p xml:id="regest1">News from the [Frankfurt] Diet is expected soon. It is said that Turks and Tatars have allied against Poland; Germany is also in danger if God does not grant sober minds. The murder of an evangelical [Imperial Chamber Court] prosecutor [Ludwig Hierter] in Speyer might be intended to intimidate [the Protestants]; Bullinger may have already heard of the treacherous machinations against [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse. Benedikt Euander visited Zwick and reported from Kempten that the dispute between Simprecht [Schenck] and [Paul] Rasdorfer has been settled. Ambrosius [Blarer] is busy and sends his regards.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>We are expecting news daily from the Diet, hopefully favorable. It is said for certain that the Turks have reconciled with the Tatars; the terms of reconciliation are that they will jointly attack Poland. If the Lord stirs up these servants of His against us, you can easily imagine the state of the extremely drunken Germans. May the Lord be with us; He will be present if He grants us a sound mind.</p>
      <p>In the public square of Speyer, a distinguished doctor of law and prosecutor of all the evangelicals was killed by a certain noble robber; however, it is not known what this means. For immediately after committing the murder, the murderer fled on horseback. Perhaps with such examples, the conspirators of the Pope are trying to frighten our side. May the Lord protect us! You may have already heard about the treacheries of certain princes against Hesse.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your whole household and all the brothers. Benedikt Euander was with me today and reports that the church in Kempten is now calm; for Simprecht and Radocomus are in agreement.</p>
      <p>Given in Konstanz, March 18, 1539.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius is busy and does not write, but sends many greetings through me.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most upright pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, my chosen brother.</p>
