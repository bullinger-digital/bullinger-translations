      <p>Greetings. I send you, most excellent man, vegetables, and those small ones, in return for your great and silver gifts, yet I did not dare to send them unless I hoped you would gather from them this: If he could, he would have given greater things. You will see from the letter of our council the plan of those attempting to strengthen letters through exercise. There are those who do not approve, but I could not resist the command, especially when it is aimed at the increase of letters, and since they have instructed me in such a way that I must obey or lose the position from which I now live. I would have invited you to the same disputation, had the harshness of winter not stood in the way. Yet it is still being considered whether they wish to invite many. For thus I offered myself, but by no means out of confidence in learning or strength. If I had them, I either lost them in such exile or have them so weakened that I plainly know them to be weaker than to place any hope in them. Whatever I did, I did for the benefit of public study and in the hope of regaining strength, with trust placed in God, who in His wisdom and goodness is accustomed to be present to His word and to those who search it and desire to know and learn from Him. What I inserted about hypotheticals, if you have time, discuss it with Dr. Theodor. In this, I was plainly so that they might finally study dialectics more diligently, without whose support they can neither rightly handle any theme, any text, nor see the places that are within.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily. Greet Dr. Theodor, Dr. Peter Tossanus. Also, in my words, ask him to deign to write to me about the place in Genesis concerning the image of man. Do not be reluctant to distribute these pronouncements. Greet Leo, Dr. Heinrich Utinger, and all the neighbors above and below.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 11, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your Carostadius [!].</p>
      <p>To the most prudent and learned man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiast of Zurich, his dearest superior.</p>
