    <p xml:id="regest1">Evaluates Kaspar [Baumgartner] at Bullinger's request, although this is not easy for him. Not untalented in studies, with room for improvement in writing, he - being diligent and quite devout - gives cause for the best hopes; he is uncorrupted, and his bold, irritable, and talkative nature - not uncommon nowadays - is balanced by his intellectual abilities.</p>

      <p>Greetings and best wishes.</p>
      <p>Indeed, venerable teacher, you impose a difficult task, to write my opinion on Kaspar's talent, which I believe your keen judgment is not unaware of, as you have seen from his speech with infallible conjectures. But mindful of my duty, I will outline the observations of our mind, partly how he has studied, partly how he has lived, from which you will judge as if from the fringe of the fabric. He seems to have the Muses not unfavorably; for he did not want to be considered the last in delivering a lecture nor to be surpassed by his peers in cultivating memory. Then, in exercising style, he has been found more diligent than fortunate so far, and I dare to affirm that this can be easily remedied, once he combines frequent reading and practice with skill. It also makes me hope for the best and conclude that he will be suitable for study, because he is an admirer of the most learned, and not at all alien to the business of piety, as if his nature reflects a certain affinity. This about his studies. Now, so that his morals and way of life correspond to these, I will add a few words: I can report nothing else for certain than that he is an upright young man and not at all deceitful, otherwise confident, irritable, talkative, and who almost wipes his face with his hand, as our age holds, which, however, are restrained by his prevailing intellect and growing learning; for I have also noted a tincture of virtue in him. Accept these with a candid mind; I wanted to make you, as far as I could, a participant in my wish, and I do not want anyone to be undeservedly ill-spoken of, much less a student.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily in Christ. 1539, from Kappel am Albis, 18th of September.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient Johannes Frey.</p>
      <p>To the venerable Antistes of the Zurich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, greatest patron.</p>
