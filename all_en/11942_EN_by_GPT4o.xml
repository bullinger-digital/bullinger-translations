    <p xml:id="regest1">Mentions an expert opinion from Konstanz [above No. 1890, Appendix 1]; Mayor Johannes Haab and Treasurer Hans Rudolf Lavater have been elected as envoys to the assembly tomorrow [April 20] in Baden; at this hour, the public council is deliberating on the response to the imperial estates; [Hans Konrad] Escher can inform Vadian of the advice [of the Zurichers], and also what the people of Basel wrote to the Zurichers about the consensus of the cities. Bullinger has received written information from confidants that the [imperial] cities have promised assistance to the Emperor. What Bullinger recently reported about the discovery of the grave [of Emperor Flavius Honorius and his wife Maria; above No. 1892, 56-59] has now been confirmed by eyewitnesses, two canons [Cornelius Wouters and Georg Cassander; see Pellikan, Chronikon 162] from Bruges, according to whose account Bullinger wrote the appendix. Froschauer has not yet returned from Frankfurt; the first returning merchants brought Bullinger three letters: from the Zittau resident Oswald Pergener from Silesia [above No. 1857], from Johannes a Lasco from Friesland [above No. 1871], and from Philipp Melanchthon from Wittenberg [above No. 1881], to whom Bullinger had sent his commentary on John [1543; HBBibl I 153f] for the last fair. Pergener writes that the Turkish-occupied Blindenburg [Plintenburg, Visegrád, Hungary] is considering surrendering [the information comes from Ambrosius Blarer's letter, above No. 1875, 36-39; Pergener reports on Stuhlweissenburg and Gran, above No. 1857, 42-46]; in Prague, the evangelical scholar Wenzel [Václav Mitmánek] has been imprisoned because he preached evangelically in the Czech language [see above No. 1857, 18-25]; there is wonder why [King] Ferdinand does not proceed against the Turk [Sultan Suleiman I.] despite the favorable situation; in Lusatia, Moravia, and Silesia, the Gospel is gaining considerable growth. Johannes a Lasco elegantly and eloquently expressed his admiration for the simplicity of the [Zurich] doctrine; Bullinger reproduces the end of the letter verbatim: Who he is, Bullinger can gather from the letters that Erasmus [of Rotterdam], his teacher in the true faith, wrote to [a Lasco]; the titles and benefices he held from youth, he has given up as well as his homeland and his friends, to preach the evangelical doctrine here in a foreign land as a servant of Christ. He asks to be accepted as a friend and brother. Verbatim reproduction of Melanchthon's letter: Melanchthon has almost entirely read Bullinger's commentary on John, also because his friend [Kaspar Cruciger] likewise comments on the Gospel of John and seeks his advice; Bullinger's [John] commentary is appropriate for the true church, salutary, and remains close to the given content; urges Bullinger to continue to make himself useful to the church with pious, useful, and moderate publications. Saw in [Bullinger's commentary on] the Gospel of Matthew the passage on monogamy [to Mt 5, 27-32; 19, 3-12]; the dialogue [Johannes Lening's] in defense of polygamy ["Dialogus ... whether it is... right to have more than one wife at the same time", also: "Dialogus Neobuli"] should not have been published, Melanchthon had expressed his opinion on it to the responsible parties before its release; silence on such errors in otherwise good people would be appropriate. Consensus and spiritual connection must not be destroyed; wants to strengthen the connection to Bullinger and asks for a response. Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, whose letter to Markus [Crodel] he accidentally saw and took to prevent the situation from worsening. Thanks to the printer [Christoph Froschauer] for the sent Bible ["Biblia sacrosancta"]. Recommends the bearer [Jakob Röist], the only son of the famous mayor [Diethelm] Röist, Bullinger's godchild, who resembles his father, is pious and diligent; he probably anticipates Bullinger's recommendation, which Vadian may approve.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [Appendix:] On February 4, 1544, during work on the foundation of the newly begun Basilica of St. Peter a Julio, not far from the rotunda, the presumed mausoleum of Emperor Honorius, a marble grave was found containing two corpses, presumably of Maria, the wife of Honorius and daughter of Flavius Stilicho, as well as of Thermantia, also wife of Honorius and daughter of Stilicho, whose deaths historians report. The bodies were wrapped in golden cloaks, their heads bore golden diadems, but upon contact with air, bones and garments crumbled to dust; the collected and purified gold weighed about 80 pounds; on the chest of one corpse was a grape-shaped ornament made of gold and gemstones; included were: some perforated vessels for aromatic essences, 53 rather large pearls that crumbled upon touch, more than 100 gold rings set with gemstones, some gold snails, gold branding irons, a silver urn, some crystal vases, a shell-like vessel made of agate; a bread-shaped ornament made of carnelian and agate with a gold, gemstone-studded circle or belt, in whose stones names were engraved on both sides: [Drawing; the following words crossing in a circle:] Stilicho, Honori Maria, Vivatis; on the other side the names of Honorius and Stilicho, Thermantia and Serena. Soon after, everything was brought to the nearby Palazzo to the Pope, where it is now kept. Follows a quote from the "Chronicon Urspergense".</p>

      <p>S. D. Your advice, recently sent to me, has already been received by us, most esteemed and always venerable man, sent by the people of Konstanz. However, your diligence was not unappreciated by us. The distinguished men, Mr. Johannes Haab, the mayor, and Mr. Johannes Rudolf Lavater, the treasurer, have been chosen as envoys to the assembly to be held tomorrow in Baden. At this very hour, the public and frequent council is deliberating on what needs to be done and what should be appropriately responded to the imperial estates. I do not distrust the matter, I do not greatly fear the threats of foreigners, the Lord will not fail those who invoke His name; yet I see that true repentance, solid faith, and fervent prayers are needed. Mr. Escher, your relative, a truly good man and a lover of ours, will be able to explain our advice to you. He will also add what the people of Basel have written to us about the consensus of the cities, etc. I have written from trusted people that the city, with weak hearts and many concerns, has also agreed to provide assistance to the Emperor, and that no one from the Emperor is likely to think of these concerns, etc. In summary: he has the people in his pocket; fear and vain worry will bring them further back than anyone can now imagine. It is desired to be so; perhaps it is God's punishment. - What I recently reported to you about the discovered mausoleum, I have meanwhile received much more certain information from those who have seen it. For during the recent Easter holidays, two very learned men, citizens and canons from Bruges, who sincerely favor Christ and the truth, passed through here, who had still been in Rome at the beginning of March. From their indications and explanations, I have written this, which I send here, to please you. They stayed with us for a few days, discussing literary and religious matters with us. They restored their weary strength from the journey, and we refreshed them with friendly conversations and banquets, etc. - Froschauer has not yet returned from Frankfurt. The first merchants who returned brought me three letters: from Oswald Pergener of Silesia, from Zittau, from Mr. Johannes a Lasco of Friesland, and from Philipp Melanchthon of Wittenberg, to whom I had sent a copy of the Commentaries on John at the last fair.</p>
      <p>Pergener writes that the fortress of Blindenburg, surrounded and weary from the Turkish siege, is contemplating surrender; everything is full of fear and despair; in Prague, the most noble and learned man, Mr. Wenceslaus, has been thrown into chains because he sincerely preached Christ in the Bohemian language. And we still wonder why Ferdinand does not use the not very favorable fortune against the Turk, who is a public enemy of Christ. Nevertheless, he adds that in Lusatia, Moravia, and Silesia, the Gospel is growing with just growth.</p>
      <p>Mr. Johannes a Lasco, a most noble baron of Poland, formerly a provost of Gniezno and illustrious in the kingdom of Poland, writes to me a letter that is copious, elegant, and beautifully friendly, in which he commends the simplicity of our doctrine and explanation of the sacred scriptures, which he says he does not find so clearly in the writings of others, who entangle certain matters of religion more than they explain them. For this reason, he confesses that he is completely captivated by love for me, etc. After many things, he finally writes these words at the end of the letter: "But it is enough that I have declared my mind towards you in this letter, that I love you vehemently and therefore also wish that all my things may be approved by you, even if I do not know you. Now if you wish to know who I am, you can easily learn it from the writings of Erasmus of Rotterdam. For there are several letters of his to me, who was also my advisor to turn my mind to sacred things; indeed, he was the first to begin to instruct me in true religion. Briefly, to proclaim the benefit and virtue of Christ the Lord in me: I was once a distinguished Pharisee, adorned with many titles, and from a young age beautifully stuffed with many and opulent benefices. But now, having voluntarily left all these things by the grace of God, having also left my homeland and friends, among whom I saw that I could not live as a Christian, I am naked among foreigners, a servant of the naked Christ the Lord crucified for me, recently appointed here as a minister of the churches in the proclamation of evangelical doctrine according to the will of Him who called me from the folds of the Pharisees to His fold through His mercy. You have my reasons. It will now be yours to receive me into your friendship and henceforth consider me as a brother. Farewell. Emden, March 14, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes a Lasco, in my own hand."</p>
      <p>"Philipp Melanchthon to the most distinguished man, excelling in learning, virtue, and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, piously teaching the Gospel in the church of Zurich, his friend S. D. I have inspected most of what you have published and tasted it; but I have almost entirely read the explanation of John. For since a certain friend of mine, who interprets John here, often discusses many opinions with me, I frequently return to your writing, also consulting you. For I love the church and have always felt that the signs of the church must be highly valued. Therefore, I compare the opinions of both the ancients and the moderns, so that I may hold and also be able to pass on the simple, native, and proper doctrine of the church to others, and I have often testified that your explanation pleases me, both because it speaks the truth and is in harmony with the true church, and then because it is salutary. Many interpreters wander and stray so far from their authors in the works of others that they say nothing or little to the point. Your explanation dwells on the proposed argument and illustrates it. Therefore, I not only thank you in my name for the book sent but also in the public name for the edition, and I encourage you to continue to deserve well of the church by publishing pious, useful, and moderate works. I saw in the place of Matthew about monogamy, and it is useful and pious to defend it with public writings, and I wish the dialogue excusing polygamy had not been published, and I expressed my judgment on it to those with whom it was born before its publication. For it was of no use to stir up that matter; rather, it should be buried in silence, and certain things should be forgiven to otherwise good and well-deserving men, and our evils should be mitigated with skill. I ask the same of you regarding letters, if any are written from these regions that are more harsh by some. Nevertheless, let us cherish the consensus and union of minds among us, and let us not allow our churches to be more divided. Basil says, the left hand is not as necessary to the right as the concord of teachers is to the church. The zeal of the good can be more easily kindled and retained, and discipline of any kind can be defended with greater gravity if teachers agree in teaching and are bound together by mutual goodwill. Therefore, as much as I can, I wish to strengthen our union, not to dissipate it. I write these things with a simple mind and candidly, and I ask you to write back about your will. I wish health to Mr. Pellican, my old friend; whose letters written to a certain Marcus I accidentally saw and took to prevent the situation from worsening. Farewell. March 25, 1544. I thank the printer for the sent Bibles."</p>
      <p>The one who will offer you these letters is the only beloved son of the illustrious Mr. Röist, the mayor, my godson, a truly excellent young man, resembling his father in all the goodness of his character. If you bestow anything upon him, the father will consider it bestowed upon himself. Therefore, I commend him to you as familiarly as possible. He also loves me sincerely, as does his father; for both are devoted to piety and honesty. May the Lord keep them safe for us for a long time. I pray that my recommendation may have some weight with you, and take these my words kindly. Love me; for I honor you sincerely. Farewell with all yours. April 19, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
