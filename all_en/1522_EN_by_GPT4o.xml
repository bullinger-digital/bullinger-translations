      <p>Greetings. I write not without annoyance, my esteemed brother, because from your latest letters I understand that mine are delivered to you late and always after the event, as the saying goes, even though I repeatedly urge those to whom I entrust them to ensure they are delivered to you promptly. But this is the fate of our most corrupt times.</p>
      <p>I recently wrote a few things about your calling to the church in Winterthur, advising against accepting that calling; but now what can I think other than that even these have not yet been delivered to you? And as the days go by... I consider it much wiser for you to remain with those to whom you were not so long ago called, rather than to go to those who have now called you. But this is neither the place nor the time to speak of this matter.</p>
      <p>Since I understand that my Antithesis was taken from you before you could read it, here I send you another.</p>
      <p>You will indicate whether you think I have reviewed the most important points, about which we have rightly or justly engaged in dispute. We are well and live by the grace of God as always. Johannes Wolphius was recently unanimously elected as pastor of the lower college in place of Heinrich Engelhart, who has happily passed on to the Lord. From Augsburg, or about the Emperor or the council, I have nothing certain to report, which I assume you are unaware of. Strange rumors are spreading about new disturbances in Saxony and about the expeditions of the bishops of Mainz and WÃ¼rzburg; how certain these are, I doubt. I see wars and rumors of wars arising everywhere, and therefore I hope our redemption is near. Farewell to you and all yours, and to your fellow ministers and friends, whom you will greet. May God grant you all a good year. January 5, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Ambrosius Blarer, most vigilant pastor of the church in Biel/Bienne, his most esteemed lord and brother. Biel.</p>
