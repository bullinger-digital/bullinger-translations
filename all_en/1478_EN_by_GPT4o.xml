      <p>Greetings. You will understand the nature of this Geneva affair from their letters to us. They wrote and sent the same things to us as they did to you. We have not yet responded; we wish to wait for and first understand your advice. We all repeatedly ask that you communicate it to us as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Farewell and excuse the brevity; for I am very busy. May your family and all the brothers be well. Bern, 20th of November, 1551.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller in his own name and on behalf of his colleagues.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his dear lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
