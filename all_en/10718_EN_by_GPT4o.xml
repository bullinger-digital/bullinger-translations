      <p>My friendly, well-intentioned service beforehand, especially to the gracious Master Heinrich.</p>
      <p>I am sending you this letter here. It was given to me by Berchtold to deliver to you. Therefore, whatever concerns you, to send to Mr. Berchtold, whether it be letters or books, you can now send to me. I will always deliver and take care of it for you.</p>
      <p>Then I thank you greatly for your gift and comforting booklet. If I could repay it, it should be done with a good and willing heart.</p>
      <p>As for new news, I just came from Bern, and I know nothing else but that everything is well, and the road to Geneva is open. My gracious lords are now riding to the Duke in Aosta. There he wants to make peace with my lords alone and offers much good. I hope the Genevans will come to a good agreement, etc.</p>
      <p>Further, gracious lord, I ask you, if you have any certain news about the Emperor, that you also inform me. As soon as I hear what is done and negotiated between the Duke and my gracious lords, I will also let you know immediately, etc. With this, I commend us to God, our only one.</p>
      <p>Greet good lords and companions for me.</p>
      <p>Given on Tuesday, St. Otmar's Day, in the year 35.</p>
      <p>Your always well-wishing supporter</p>
      <p>Sulpitius Haller, chief bailiff in Lenzburg.</p>
      <p>Also know that our good brother Franz has passed away.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, servant and proclaimer of God's word in the city of Zurich, my especially dear lord and [...] supporter.</p>
