      <p>C[oelius] S[ecundus] C[urio] through Christ Jesus sends greetings.</p>
      <p>I wrote to you recently, most illustrious and esteemed lord, about a matter which you yourself know; I wrote, however, as to a friend, a brother, and a prudent man, and I do not think I am mistaken in this opinion; yet I seem to sense something here and I fear that somehow, without your fault, this matter has reached the ears of those people. Therefore, I am compelled to be anxious until this doubt is removed by you.</p>
      <p>I therefore beg you, my most excellent lord and brother, to write to me as soon as possible, whether you think it could have been possible for what I wrote to you about this matter to have leaked from there to here.</p>
      <p>I indeed thought that you would do something about this matter with the brothers there, but with my name suppressed, so that I would not incur the hatred of those people; for you yourself know very well how irritable and implacable they are. Farewell with all your family.</p>
      <p>It has been written to our merchants here from Antwerp that thirty ships, in which there were both soldiers and stipends, which were heading from Spain to Marseille, have perished in a storm, and likewise eight ships, which were carrying gold from the New Indies to Spain, have also sunk in the Ocean.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord. In Zürich.</p>
