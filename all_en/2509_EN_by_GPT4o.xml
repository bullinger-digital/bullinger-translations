      <p>S. D. P. I received your very brief letter, most excellent man and most esteemed brother, but it was full of kindness and duty, along with the enclosed Italian letters, for which I am grateful to your charity and consider it unnecessary to reiterate my readiness to follow your instructions.</p>
      <p>I wish to inform you briefly that a certain diligent and learned young man has come there and resides, whom the people of Bern support, named Perino, who is a sworn disciple of Castalio, namely a man (as those who wish to know) of the Servetian and Pelagian persuasion. I say nothing about Laelius the Italian, as you may know him perhaps no less than I do and could have heard about him from Geneva. However, I wish all to be well, if it pleases God. There are some here who deny that Servetus said those things which Calvin attributes to him, and they are very upset that his books were burned, which they would have redeemed with much money. But I cease to speak further, lest I, as I have done so far, provoke those sycophants and liars and hypocrites against me in vain. However, I have said nothing that I cannot legally sustain. Here I have almost no friends, because I am not a Servetian or Coelian or Castalionian or Lutheran or a hypocrite and flatterer. But enough of this, and there is no reason for you to write even a word to anyone here on my behalf.</p>
      <p>I write nothing of new matters, because you can know them better than I can, and also because I am already weary of them. May the Lord God and best Father through Christ increase you with His gifts and continually guide you with all yours. From Basel, December 24, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Guglielmo Grataroli.</p>
      <p>To ZÃ¼rich.</p>
