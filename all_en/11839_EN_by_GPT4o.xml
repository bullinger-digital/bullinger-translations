    <p xml:id="regest1">Requests to support [Hans] Wilpert Zoller, who is applying for a position at the court of [Count Georg of Württemberg], and to admonish him if courtly life should have a negative influence on him; Erb should also report on Zoller's behavior. Erasmus Fabritius [Schmid] has written to [Hans Henman] Truchsess [von Rheinfelden] on the same matter. The conditions [in Zürich] are calm; the council has severely punished some mercenaries due to the strict mercenary mandate; God will assist us in these dangerous times. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter to you, the young Wilpert Zoller, born of a most honorable family, seeks to join the court of your prince and desires to be enlisted in the service of the prince.</p>
      <p>His family aims for nothing else than for him to be honorably educated among the best. The holy manners of the prince, the temperate court, and the intact religion are pleasing. After serving the prince for several years, he will be recalled, or if the prince is pleased with the young man's service, he will be happy to serve him longer. Therefore, I ask two things of you: First, that you assist in having him received by the prince, either directly with the prince himself or with Mr. Truchsess or other noble men. Secondly, that once received, you always guide him in piety and restrain him if he wishes to be exposed to the crime of luxury through association and contagion.</p>
      <p>Finally, act as a father and write occasionally about how he conducts himself. Mr. Erasmus Fabritius has written to Mr. Truchsess on this same matter. If it will be possible to gratify you and yours in any matter, you will find me spontaneous and benevolent.</p>
      <p>Our affairs in these most dangerous turmoils are quite well, thanks to God. Our church is tranquil. Very few from the city and countryside followed the French banners and were severely punished by the magistrate, who prohibited mercenary service with a strict edict. These are grave and dangerous times, but God knows how to lead the pious out of temptation with Lot, Noah, Abraham, Jeremiah, and the apostles, and to keep the impious for judgment to be punished. Let us therefore encourage all entrusted to our faith to pursue piety. This will provide counsel in consultations, strength in temptations, and finally a happy outcome.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you and all yours. Greet the dearest Mr. Nikolaus Regius and the other brothers.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 2, 1543.</p>
      <p>Mr. Megander, your beloved godfather, greets you along with the other brothers.</p>
      <p>Especially greet Vogler and commend him. Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Matthias Erb in Reichenweier, teaching Christ at the most illustrious prince and count of Württemberg, both esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
