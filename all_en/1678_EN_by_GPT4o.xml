      <p>My entire friendly willing service, along with all that I can honor, love, and possess, is sent to you from me beforehand. Dear lord and brother, these two students, who are originally from Augsburg and have come here from Italy, but now wish to travel back home via St. Gallen, reach out to you with my very friendly request that you provide them with guidance so that they may pass through most safely, or if this route does not seem suitable to you, but another from Zurich to Augsburg seems more appropriate and pleasing, then please inform them of the same and have them entrusted to you on my behalf in this and otherwise. This obliges me to you in a very friendly and willing manner. Dated Basel, Tuesday, the 12th of July, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>Your willing Heinrich Ryhiner, city scribe of Basel. To the honorable and well-learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the city of Zurich, my dear lord and brother.</p>
