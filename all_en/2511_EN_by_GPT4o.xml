      <p>S. P. I would accurately excuse my interruption of correspondence with you, most excellent man, if I did not fear that, upon explaining the causes of my prolonged silence, you would accept it less.</p>
      <p>For up until this very day, I have been unwillingly forced to cease writing because I could find no one through whom I might send my letters to you. Therefore, I had to wait until I could entrust my letters to men of proven and known faith, lest, as often happens to us, they be intercepted midway by wicked receivers here and there. How troublesome, how grievous this silence has been for me, I thought you could understand, especially since I must act among those with whom neither faith nor piety agrees with me. Is it not understood, therefore, that there is just cause to inveigh against the injustice of such great silence, especially when your consolations could greatly help me against all the blasphemies of the evil one? Certainly, we are some who are blinder than any pagans, more restless than all the gentiles, who, though illuminated by the greater eternal splendor of the divine, yet recognize the truth less than they, but like in darkness, we grope at the eyes of the soul.</p>
      <p>The foolishness of this bewitched populace seemed strange to me from the beginning, because I had never before seen such idol worship; but in the meantime, I have learned to become more and more profane. However, in this lamentable misery of calamity, we still have one convenience, that due to the necessity of our homeland, we live more freely and reside in that city which provides us with more security than others. In recent days, we have seen some things that Theodor Beza has published about the punishment and penalty for heretics. We see a few other things, almost surreptitious, that arise in your borders.</p>
      <p>But these are hardly sufficient, for our weakness is far greater than can be remedied by so few means. Surely, it is now apparent to you why I have so often longed to be strengthened by the sight of your hand. Therefore, I was greatly pleased when I was informed of this opportunity to write to you, and I thought it necessary to inform you that, although I know you are perpetually distracted by great cares, you should know that I am greatly uplifted by the memory and recollection of you. If it is free for me to request anything from you, as I hope it is, there is one thing I would especially like to see with great ardor. I remember, when passing through your city, experiencing the wonderful humanity of you all, and from Mr. Bibliander, I heard some excellent things that our civil discipline's more sincere cohort eagerly expects.</p>
      <p>For he promised me that he would demonstrate with the most proven reasons that the main supports of our adversaries, which they seek from the Code of Justinian, have crept in deceitfully and fraudulently among its constitutions. Although this is evident to any sensible person, there is no one who can depict the crimes of those plagiarists with such great light as he himself can.</p>
      <p>Therefore, not only in my name, though I request it extremely, but also in the wishes of all who come to this hope, it is greatly desired of him as a duty, that since nothing is so necessary, nothing so magnificent as to silence the most mendacious mouths of the popes, and he knows how to do this excellently, he should gratify the entire assembly of our doctrine. It will be equally your duty to urge him, as much as you can with authority and speech, to complete this excellent work, so that finally, as it is already clear to a few of us, it may soon be manifest to all that these surreptitious patchworks are indeed so. You will indeed bind all devoted to this discipline to you with such a great benefit that you will easily achieve the palm of having deserved much from our civil art as well. For who will not have the greatest thanks for you, whoever has ever read their spurious tricks there, so that this saying of Lucillius fits more truly on them than on any thief like Dion. If Hermes were to take away the wings of Zeus, there would no longer be any man among men, but Zeus would be left alone. Therefore, I urge this, as much as my modesty does not forbid, that we should not be deprived any longer of the much-anticipated fruit of our legal study, and I especially beg you to offer my respect to Mr. Pellican, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Gwalter, Mr. Wolphius, and the other men not only most learned but also of the most complete sanctity of life, and to wish them a happy and prosperous end of the coming year. If it is not burdensome for you to bless me with your letters, I beg you to send them to Bern to Mr. Musculus, my second father due to the sacred font and regeneration service; he will ensure that your most desired letters are safely delivered to me. Farewell, most faithful overseer of doctrine and piety, and love me, as you do. From Bourges, December 26, 1554.</p>
      <p>Devoted to your humanity in all things, Raphael Seiler.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful preacher of the divine word, to be honored as a lord and as a father with every kind of observance.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland.</p>
