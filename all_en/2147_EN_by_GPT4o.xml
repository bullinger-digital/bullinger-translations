      <p>I had retreated a little into the countryside; meanwhile, your letters were brought, reverend sir, which I found at my home when I returned today. I read what you wrote about Philipp, in which I especially approve that he refrained from anything not pertaining to him.</p>
      <p>It is well when each person exercises themselves in the art they have learned and confines themselves within the bounds of their duty. However, I have not yet explained the many and indeed great reasons why not only I, but countless other good and prudent men, with whom my insignificance forbids me to be compared, have judged that it would not be to the advantage of the king nor to the good and safety of our state to unite with the king under such treaty terms as our allies were joined with the king in that last treaty, nor do I see why I should mention them even now.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, our republic is not entirely alien to the king, as it has a unique peace and friendship with him.</p>
      <p>It acknowledges these benefits received from that renowned kingdom and its most powerful kings; but it has also conducted itself in peace and war in such a way that it cannot be blamed. In bestowing benefits, the happiness of the most opulent king is greater and the capacity of our republic is lesser, than what should or could compete with you on equal terms. Therefore, as one who loves my country sincerely, I gladly read your statement: "We have always embraced you all," and that you have always strived for the welfare, safety, and honor of your country, which you hope to do more and more.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the humanity and gratitude of our people are such that it will also pursue mutual favor according to its abilities. I have never judged that all those dwelling in the courts of princes are Proteuses and that none of them have any regard. If you weigh well what I wrote recently, you will not recall that universal judgment. In the Egyptian court, Joseph is found, an incomparable man, most excellent in every virtue. In the palaces of the kings of Judah and Israel, indeed, as in all orders, there was a great rabble of depraved men, equipped with a thousand deceits and corruptions; but at the same time, there dwelt with the princes illustrious lights of all piety and wisdom. In the court of the Babylonian king, Daniel excels with his companions; in the royal court of the Persians and Medes, Mordecai and Nehemiah appear. Nor do I doubt that the Lord has his worshippers in the courts of all the kings and princes of this most corrupt last age, and I sincerely wish for you, whom I otherwise do not know closely, to be among their number, whom I judge from the letters written to me over several months to be a man endowed by God with both letters and heroic abilities in an uncommon way.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant you to use well those gifts received from God. Furthermore, in my function, I am neither Suffenus nor Mevius to myself, so that with the most sacred apostle of Christ I continually exclaim: "I am conscious of no unfaithfulness in my duty; but I am not thereby justified," not that I compare myself, a rejected man, with the most elect instrument of God, but that I freely acknowledge myself to be so much more imperfect and more prone to sins, as I am inferior to the most excellent apostle of Christ. I recognize that among those who wish to announce the gospel of Christ and appear to be excellent ministers of the church, there are more Vertumnuses than is conducive to the progress of the gospel, while they indeed incline now here, now there, and speak about the same matter not with the constancy that was fitting. However, you are not unaware from ecclesiastical histories that this is not happening for the first time now and that the apostles complained gravely about the same matter, yet they did not want this to be a hindrance to the faithful and to the very business of saving truth. "It is necessary," says the Lord, "that offenses come; but woe to those through whom they come." You, however, who admire me as a good man and strive to win me over with some honorable service, I love and will try to win over in return with honorable services; and I thank you very much for that benevolence of yours, sincerely praying to the Lord that he may grant and increase his spirit to me, so that he may approve me and my works and endeavors, and preserve me in true probity, lest I ever become reprobate. - There is nothing left to be paid to the courier, nor do you burden me with any expenses; our Vergerius made all those expenses.</p>
      <p>The Imperialists boast that England has been made theirs, and that through the betrothal of the queen and the Spaniard, and indeed the English write to me that she has married Philipp, that Coroebus. They add that these things were done through the arts and prudence of Reginald Pole, mediated by the legate of the pope, by whose same blandishments and hypocrisy the king of the French is to be led (if he is not already led) into peace terms favorable to the Emperor, and that negotiations are already underway for peace to be reconciled, and therefore, if it is not already reconciled, the rustic Swiss soldier has been sent home from the Allobroges. Furthermore, it is being consulted now about the Council of Trent being reinstated according to the will of the Emperor and the pope, which the king of the French is likely to consent to, perhaps to aid the Emperor's obstinacy. In short: all matters are to be tempered by the wisdom of the Emperor so that shortly the king of the French will be both the subduer and devastator of the Swiss, and finally the restorer of papism in full and the extinguisher of the light of the gospel, perhaps even the conqueror of the infernal regions and more beyond. I, secure in these triumphs of the Imperialists, certainly know that Christ will reign in his own, however persecutions may rage until the end of the age. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe in soul and body. ZÃ¼rich, January 5.</p>
