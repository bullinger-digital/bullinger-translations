      <p>Greetings. I was not going to write because I was sending some things to my brother, so that he could share them with you. But since I have such a suitable messenger, our very close lord and relative, Mr. Emanuel, I did not want to send him to you without my own letter.</p>
      <p>You will hear all our news from him. Meanwhile, I am sending what I have received further, but in the French language, because it was not possible to have these things transcribed into the German language in the meantime. Farewell. I wrote about the rest a few days ago.</p>
      <p>Bern, April 13, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
