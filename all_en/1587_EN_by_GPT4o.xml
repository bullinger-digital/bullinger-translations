      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, may you be well. Some friends came to us from the Curia of the Rhaetians, who say they heard that the ministers of the Grisons wrote to you to ask what you think about the case of Paravicini, whether you consider him to be admitted into the number of ministers or rather to be expelled. I wish these things were done sincerely and not rather with a spirit of slander, which I strongly suspect. I would have preferred, and still prefer, that the wounds and schisms of our churches be covered and that we take care to heal and unite them, rather than to sound the trumpet that a dissension has arisen and to exacerbate the spirits of our leaders, who are looking for an opportunity. This was my opinion. I wish that he who is now agitating the matter had followed it! I predict, Heinrich Bullinger, that from this spark a fire will arise. I know the temperaments, I know the power of the Valtellina people; I know how their spirits are stirred when they hear that their pastor has been so harshly treated. As for me, I confess that I wished for an opportunity by which I could honestly abstain from the synod and from the handling of all those matters, and I am glad that it has now been offered to me, and I will not abandon it, believe me. I advise one thing, since your piety allows me to say everything I feel freely to you: it will happen that Galitius will publish your letters everywhere, if you write even a little, by which he can boast and glory, indeed he will report to the magistrate, shouting that certain people are not to be tolerated.</p>
      <p>Nor do I disagree if you or he says that Anabaptists are not to be tolerated; but I would add that they should not be immediately expelled, but care should be taken to win them over to us and that the whole world may understand that we are not hasty in condemning. This is the state of this case. You yourself know that I do not approve of his doctrine; but I think we should act prudently and with great gentleness and love, just as our Lord God deals with us. But if we see him obstinate and no hope of salvation in him, then at last let us be severe and strict. But here it began with severity, I wish it had not been with a certain rusticity!</p>
      <p>By the grace of God, I am well and work day and night; but as the saying goes, a man of no account, I achieve little. I am now preparing a new book against the council, but in Italian; for I must serve that audience. Every day brothers from Italy warn me to beware of the Antichrist, who they say is more incensed against me than can be expressed, but it is well: I have wounded the beast and will wound it further. Farewell and be well. May the Lord Jesus bless your labors. Amen.</p>
      <p>I greet all the brothers. Vicosoprano, March 3, 1552. Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
