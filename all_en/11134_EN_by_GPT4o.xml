    <p xml:id="regest1">The hope, nurtured by Bullinger's letter, that Zurich would support a violent action against [Wilhelm Arsent and his companions], was disappointed at the [Baden] Diet; particularly the Zurich envoy [Hans Edlibach] is said to have secretly favored the Five Places through his advocacy. Myconius has been asked by the authorities to influence Bullinger to prevent such actions in the future. He himself has heard various rumors about the stance of the Zurichers and fears for the friendship between the two cities; although Basel does not seek war, the crime must not go unpunished. Capito writes that concord with Luther is assured if one adheres to the [First Helvetic] Confession. Bullinger is to destroy this letter.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I write with various concerns, because I am almost compelled, not indeed by this or that person, but by the matter itself. Your letters have cheered us not a little, in which you indicated that no one there is not grieved by the robbery through the great injustice inflicted on our city, from which we had hoped that if our senate were to attempt anything by force against the wrongdoers, the help of the Zurichers would not be the last. But I hear that the opposite has happened at this Diet; for that envoy of yours (you know whom I mean, whom I wish to be indicated to you alone) privately, as if soliciting, asked that everyone be cautious, lest war break out. It is said that he was almost solely the reason why the Five Places dared to propose their decrees to us more boldly. This has so upset the leading men here that some have been instructed to complain to you about what he has done, if by any means it can be prevented in the future, so that the same does not happen again. The only thing that sustains them is that no such mandate was given by the senate, and they rely not only on your letters but also on rumors, which said that the Zurichers would be among the first to avenge the injustice. A few days ago, someone came who said that those beyond the Elbe mountain were scarcely restrained from running here of their own accord. I was joking four days ago with a citizen of Zurich at my table, saying that I had little hope of your support if necessity ever pressed, etc. He took it very badly, affirming that he knew what his people were like towards the city of Basel, although now he spared words. For he had heard and seen what would happen openly if Basel were to attempt anything against its enemies. But if indeed anything of the sort were committed and discovered by our people, it would be feared that a large part of the friendship diligently maintained until now would be lost.</p>
      <p>The nature of ambition has never deceived me, nor does it deceive me today. You do as you know with these things. We do not anxiously seek war, but we cannot bear injustice except with the loss of goods and even of the gospel. Although this is not apparent now, the time will come when it will be apparent, but with greater loss.</p>
      <p>Regarding our concord, Capito sends these words: "Concord with Luther would be certain if we seriously proceeded according to your Basel confession." Farewell happily with yours.</p>
      <p>In haste, Basel, January 10, 1538.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>Letters read and destroyed.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his venerable brother in the Lord.</p>
