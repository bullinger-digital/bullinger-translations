      <p>Greetings and peace in the Lord. John from Ulm has often invited me before now to write to you, most excellent Bullinger; but recently he has left no stone unturned to extort these few words from me to you. And to confess frankly, he could scarcely persuade me to write even now, not because I have doubted your humanity or because that candor of your mind is not already well known from your writings and the speech of many, but partly because I have given up writing in Latin due to long disuse, and partly because I am more bashful than to dare to trouble you, who are involved in so many and such great matters of the church, with my unpolished letters. I willingly confess that I owe this duty to you, most learned man, and I acknowledge that I owe you many and great thanks for that honorable mention you made of me in your letters to my lord, the Marquess of Dorset. Certainly, I have long pursued you with the greatest love and reverence for that true religion and have considered myself greatly indebted to you in the name of all Christians. But recently, my dear Bullinger, you have rendered me so bound by my own name and that of my country that you could not do so more in the future; for you seem to be affected with a certain paternal spirit and uncommon love towards our England. In many ways, you have adorned it publicly everywhere with your excellent labors and most learned books, and hence you have obtained true and just praise among all good and learned men, of whom a great number (thanks be to God Almighty) is found among us at present, and from this you can know how not in vain you have labored among us in the vineyard of the Lord, and how much honor and grace is due to our most excellent king and how much we owe to our magistrates, who not only favor the truth excellently themselves but also show themselves to be good and vigorous patrons to all who embrace this truth. Nor have you certainly bestowed undeserved or unworthy praise in these your writings; for they rightly deserve to be praised in every respect, and we rightly rejoice whenever it happens that you inscribe your labors to men of this kind. For you add great spur and wonderful encouragement to those who are running, so that they do not hesitate to complete excellently what they have begun well, which I hope will happen soon. For they have recently convened a synod and chosen certain men to cleanse our church from the filth of the Antichrist and to abolish the impious laws of the Roman pontiff, by which the bride of Christ has long been miserably and disgracefully contaminated, and to substitute new and better and holier ones.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it will be our duty to diligently pray to God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, that not only here but everywhere in the world the true, pure, and sincere truth may finally begin to flourish. I have written more, most excellent Bullinger, than I initially intended, and yet many things remain about which I would gladly like to be informed by you if time allowed; but I will defer for the present. Perhaps I will freely impart whatever will trouble me next time. Meanwhile, farewell, most excellent man, and I pray to God that He may keep you safe with us for a long time to manifest His glory. Oxford, on the Nones of January.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Ralph Skinner.</p>
      <p>These letters will be delivered to the most excellent and learned man, Lord Bullinger.</p>
      <p>John... mere... princes</p>
