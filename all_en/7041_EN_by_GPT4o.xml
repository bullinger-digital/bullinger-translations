      <p>Greetings. I have received the booklet on the deeds of the Turks, most esteemed sir, for which I thank you. Besides what I wrote to you and to Mr. Gwalther a few days ago, I now have almost nothing to add. The Gothic war seems to be nurturing a monster, as I have long since indicated to you. The Saxon and the papists are pressing it the most; but while the others pretend to engage in it more than they actually do, they indeed make a move, but achieve nothing. It will be very difficult, if not impossible, for the Spaniard to lead soldiers from Germany into Belgium. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg, March 2, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Georg von Stetten.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, pious, and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Zurich church, his esteemed [hidden] lord and friend in Zurich.</p>
