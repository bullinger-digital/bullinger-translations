    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius should take care of forwarding the enclosed bundle to Strasbourg. It should be delivered to the Englishman John Burcher, Richard Hilles, or their wives [Adelheit, née Knüpli, or Anna, née Lacey,] by a reliable messenger. Bullinger asks for nothing more!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[Otherwise] he is eagerly awaiting a letter from Myconius.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Although he has not yet met the Zurich envoy Andreas Schmid after his return [from France], he has learned that the Swiss envoys were received in a princely manner by King Henry II of France. The baptism of Claude de France, the king's daughter, took place in the afternoon between 5 and 6 o'clock [on February 7 in Fontainebleau]. The envoys were courteously and kindly received and gifted by Henry II and Queen Catherine de' Medici: Each received a chain worth 800 crowns from the king and another worth 200 crowns from the queen! Additionally, the envoys were generously provided with travel money and clothing for their journey. Upon their departure, the king earnestly urged the Swiss to maintain unity. Bullinger cannot elaborate on the many arguments he presented here. Although he did not offer the Swiss any binding support, he solemnly declared his willingness to protect the Swiss Confederation with his own blood, even to die as a good Swiss.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">This should be added: Upon seeing the splendid and pompous appearance of the Swiss before Henry II, the imperial envoys standing among the spectators wondered what kind of princes they were! Captain Wilhelm Frölich, who was also in the crowd, replied that they were those who do not care about emperors and princes, but who give a beating to those who meddle with them. One of the imperial envoys admitted to having already learned that they were Swiss, but he had not expected such a princely appearance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Incidentally, according to reports from friends in Paris, [including probably Ludwig Lavater], the old-believing sacrificial priests of the Sorbonne are raging against the truth! Even though great hope is placed in the king, the court is full of papist scum. Oh, may [a new] Elijah appear together with a Jehu at the courts of Henry II and Emperor Charles V and act there as he once did!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Greetings. In great haste.</p>

      <p>S.D. I wish for nothing else, my dearest and venerable Myconius, than for you to ensure that this small package is delivered to Strasbourg by a reliable person who happens to be available, and handed over either to Mr. Burcher the Englishman or to Mr. Richard Hilles or their wives.</p>

      <p>I am eagerly awaiting your letters.</p>

      <p>Our envoy has returned from France. Although I have not yet greeted him, I understand that the envoys were received as princes. The queen was baptized in the evening between 5 and 6. The king himself and the queen conversed very familiarly and amicably with the envoys. The king gifted each with a chain worth 800 crowns, and the queen with a chain worth 200 crowns. Additionally, he was generous regarding clothing and travel expenses. Upon their departure, the king earnestly and amicably exhorted them to concord, presenting many arguments which I cannot now recount. He did not offer his wealth and kingdom to the Swiss, but with his hand on his chest and heart, he promised to defend Switzerland with his own blood, and that he would die as a good confederate, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I will add one more thing: The emperor's envoys were also present. When they saw our envoys being led to the king with great pomp and splendidly dressed, they asked (standing in the crowd, the imperial envoys), "What kind or who, I ask, are these princes?" Captain Frölich, standing in the courtly crowd, replied: "They are precisely those who do not care about emperors and princes, and who give a good beating to those who meddle with them." An envoy from the imperial side responded: "I hear, therefore, that they are Swiss. How, I ask, are they equal to princes! Who would have thought?", etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Otherwise, I have from the letters of friends writing from Paris that the sacrificial monks of the Sorbonne are raging against the truth. There is indeed great hope in the king, but the court is too full of papist dregs. Oh, may some Elijah come accompanied by Jehu to the court of France and the emperor and do what was once done.</p>

      <p>Farewell. In great haste. Zurich, March 14, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Oswald Myconius, his esteemed lord and brother. Basel.</p>
