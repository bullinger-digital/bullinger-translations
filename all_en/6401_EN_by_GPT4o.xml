      <p>Greetings. I have received all your letters and everything else, and I give great thanks for all of these.</p>
      <p>When I received your last letter, in which you mentioned that the castle of Ramüs was burned and that the honorable consul Martin asked me to inform our consul, I immediately went to the consul. He had already received letters on the same matter and was preparing to present the entire issue to the senate.</p>
      <p>I went straight to the inn "Ciconiae," where I heard your envoy, Mr. Johannes von Capaul, was staying, who was said to have returned from Baden in the evening.</p>
      <p>As you instructed, I explained the entire matter to him. He was shocked; I reassured him.</p>
      <p>Soon a senator came from the senate, who reported to him that it had already been decreed in the senate that the received letters should be sent to Baden to the consul; for the Swiss envoys are still here and will only leave tomorrow. Otherwise, haste will be necessary.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in the name of all the Swiss, envoys from Zürich, Lucerne, Schwyz, and Glarus will go to Rhaetia. I had a friendly conversation with the noble von Capaul; he praised you greatly, etc.</p>
      <p>The booklet he is compiling is not yet fully prepared; otherwise, I would now send it to the bishop; but better late than poorly done. I am sorry to hear that the castle, which I hear was elegant, was burned.</p>
      <p>Let us hope we do not soon hear that those madmen have devastated other places! They want to start a new peasant war. May the Lord grant us peace! Apart from what I wrote eight days ago, I have received nothing from friends. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zürich, March 9.</p>
      <p>Greet the most honorable envoy and the consuls most kindly.</p>
      <p>Do not forget to send the wine to my honorable mayor.</p>
      <p>I have read your letter; he thanks you sincerely, and for your convenience, you should prepare. First, ensure that you are avenged without delay, then that he is not harmed on the journey here; my lord Tscharner can help you with that, so that it is done in such a way that no one can interfere. 1565. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful pastor of the Church of Chur, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
