      <p>God be with us! Here you have what has come to me from Bern.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I have nothing new from elsewhere. Many rumors are going back and forth, on which I place little value; everyone says what they would like to see happen, which does not happen because of that. From Basel, our people bring nothing but also the clamor about the black riders. Also, Archduke Ferdinand is said to be in Freiburg in Breisgau, having imposed 10 gold thalers* as taxes on the poor people. When they complained greatly, saying it was beyond their means, he said he did so because it is a rich land; thus, they present themselves as beggars. And when they offered him 5 gold thalers, he left it at 10, which is a great burden for the community. He has hurried back to Innsbruck. A wealthy priest has willingly given him a gift of 500 guilders. Therefore, the prince asked what kind of lord he was, who would give him such a great gift; when he heard that he was very rich from many benefices, he offered him to give him another 5000 guilders, which he had to do. All of this is good Roman robbery. We Swiss see this before our doors and are not moved. The young Austrians would gladly desire to conquer us and take us back. We do not see this, running after foreign princes and lords, also the pension; not caring for our land and freedom. When we then lose our strength with foreign lords, then it will be time for the greedy to devour us and for the arrogant priest to climb onto our heads, etc. May God have mercy on us and take his own away beforehand, so that we do not have to see the misery; for our being demands a great punishment; unless God once again shows himself gracious for the sake of his chosen ones; for which we will sincerely pray.</p>
      <p>Just now, as I write this, letters come to me from Augsburg, dated November 1st, stating that the Duke of Alba sends from the Netherlands 1500 horsemen and 4000 foot soldiers. Their commander is von Arnberg; these are moving to the king against the Conde. The Turk is arming 270 ships; the Venetians are also arming themselves, etc. God be with you!</p>
      <p>Greet for me my lords the mayor, Captain Carlin, and Pontasella, Mr. Ganthner, and other dear and good friends of ours.</p>
      <p>Dated November 14, 1567.</p>
      <p>Yours always.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur, my kind, dear lord and brother. Chur.</p>
