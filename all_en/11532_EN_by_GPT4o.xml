    <p xml:id="regest1">The wish of the Geneva church to bring back Calvin, who was expelled by them, has already been presented to the people of Strasbourg [in November] by a delegation from Geneva; it is their duty to promote the Kingdom of God by allowing Calvin to move to the place of activity appropriate for him - on the border between Germany and Italy - just as the church of Antioch once released Paul and Barnabas for the mission to the Gentiles; if they comply with this request, they are assured of God's favor and praise among the people.</p>

      <p>To the most faithful and learned pastors and doctors, ministers of the church of Straßburg, brothers in the Lord, to be revered and beloved.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ. Concerning the church of Geneva, what it once was you know, brothers in the Lord to be revered and beloved, who have received and kindly supported the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, who was most undeservedly expelled from there, with great praise from all good people. Nor are you unaware of what it has now become through the grace of the Lord. For it has sent to you a most honorable delegation, recalling its most faithful pastor Calvin. For while he is absent from the church and acts as if in exile, the Lord so moderates the affairs of that ungrateful church that it is compelled to openly see and feel what kind of pastors it now deserves to have, and what kind it once drove away. And for this reason, we rightly give great thanks to divine goodness, which has gathered and recalled the scattered sheep rushing to their own ruin. You ought, however, to especially support this work of the Lord, which has begun, with your favor, and help with your counsel, so that it may be completed, that is, to strive with all your might that the church may be restored to its pastor, whom it seeks with so many prayers and sighs, whom it has finally requested with such an honorable delegation.</p>
      <p>This very thing is urged upon you by that just obedience to which you are bound to God. For to oppose divine calling is to rebel against God: to follow the calling is to obey. And who will deny that Calvin is being recalled by divine calling?</p>
      <p>This very thing is demanded of you by piety towards the Lord Jesus, whose kingdom you undoubtedly wish to extend. You will extend it most widely if you restore Calvin to his church. You know that the church of Geneva is situated almost on the borders of Germany and Italy, from where that man, adorned with the most excellent gifts from God, can benefit the churches of several kingdoms more, and propagate the kingdom of Christ more extensively, than if he were to teach anywhere else in the world. This very thing is demanded of you by Christian love for the brothers, which commands you to offer not only Calvin but also your own souls to the people of Geneva. Finally, your counsel is urged by the example of the apostolic church, namely that of Antioch, in which, although Paul and Barnabas were useful and indeed necessary, when they were called to preach the gospel to the Gentiles, it did not at all oppose the divine calling, but yielded kindly, helped greatly, and followed those departing with love and the most ardent prayers. If you imitate this very thing with good faith and sincere love, most esteemed brothers, you will receive grace from God and your piety and humanity will be wonderfully commended among men.</p>
      <p>We now join our prayers to these, and we beseech you, most beloved brothers in the Lord, by the name of the Lord Jesus, not to abandon the church in peril: we beseech you by the love of the Lord Jesus to restore the pastor to his church. You alone, if you wish, can save that church. But if you either refuse or do not earnestly press for Calvin, you will cast it into the greatest danger. We hope, however, that the complaints of so many saints recalling Calvin will have great influence with you, as well as our prayers, who love and honor you sincerely in the Lord, who finally, for the sake of the church of Straßburg and the brothers, would undertake anything with a willing mind, if the matter so requires. Grant, we beseech you, Calvin to his church, love us, live and farewell in our Lord Jesus Christ, brothers in the Lord to be revered and most beloved. Zürich, 4th April 1541.</p>
      <p>The pastors and doctors, ministers of the church of Zürich, yours.</p>
