      <p>Greetings. I give you immortal thanks, reverend father in Christ, and indeed so much that even if I had a hundred tongues and a hundred mouths, I could not express in words the extent of your merits towards me. Already, when your letters were delivered to me, a rumor had spread that Lyon had been captured; the same was consistently affirmed by Mr. de Rozins, who was here at the same time.</p>
      <p>But I do not trust such rumors, as I have long known that those ill-fated birds sing no good song. Nevertheless, it was very pleasant for us to have something certain and verified from your letters.</p>
      <p>Do not think that I keep these things to myself; what needs to be published and known, I immediately send to the brothers here and there, so that you should certainly be persuaded that when you write to me, you are almost writing individually to the faithful of the Three Leagues. I had someone who could conveniently carry it to Valtellina, and someone who could take it to Chiavenna.</p>
      <p>I return everything in good faith and hope that some of ours will go to the market and safely deliver everything. I would not entrust matters of such importance to anyone other than our citizens.</p>
      <p>Regarding the council, I am still waiting to know what has been done or will be done, and although I have not yet received anything from friends, I hope to receive something soon, unless their promises deceive me. You know how Mr. Traversius and Friedrich von Salis initially promised many things extensively, saying that they had a certain nephew who was at the court of the Cardinal of Mantua, from whom they could learn everything; but what they have accomplished so far, we see. I am very surprised whether those things are true, which are so consistently written and reported from many places, namely, that 10 serious men, who were on a mission to the Genevans on behalf of Condé, were intercepted and miserably slaughtered by a certain Baron of Schwarzenburg without witnesses, and that this incident has caused a great delay for us. The chief scribe of St. Gallen writes the same; I have read the letters.</p>
      <p>The same was narrated by a trustworthy man from Schaffhausen with all the circumstances; they add that their merchants heard it from German horsemen themselves. If you have any certainty, note it in at least three words; the detours are long, and the story (if it is indeed true) is known to us. Your latest letters arrived very opportunely while I was dining with Consul Tscharner, and at the table were those whom you would wish well, and along with them Gregory Carlin. To whom your letters were certainly like sweetmeats.</p>
      <p>They kindly asked me to greet you and thank you for the news you continually impart to us. Carlin, being a soldier, was very optimistic for himself, especially because Guise would guard himself after the beginnings and reserve the king for some unknown event, but would send to Breisach. I hope either a battle has been fought or will be fought very soon, and I promise myself a certain victory from God, not from those numerous troops, because I know that he has kept the same order with the French, which the ecclesiastical histories testify to have been kept from the beginning. He brings his own to the extreme, so that they may know who it is that rescues them from there and leads them from narrowness to the open. The admirable works of God are splendid.</p>
      <p>As for our affairs, you have the letters of Mr. Augustin (there is no need to return them). I was the author for our senate to write to the praetor of Tirano and the vicar of Valtellina and send their own courier to urge them to detain the scoundrel in chains. But that praetor is said to be notably avaricious, and I fear that with the intervention of money, our authority will not have a place. Perhaps this also contributes: Vogt Vogel from Glarus writes to Carlin that Frölich has written that he would gladly suffer the Confederates, who had recently broken out, to be already inside.</p>
      <p>For Guise does not dare to trust his German troops; they are to be feared, it would ultimately lie with Guise and the Confederates. I add nothing about the Bernese; I do not accuse, but (as I had done) I no longer defend.</p>
      <p>There is nothing so dire that our people do not eagerly vomit against them. It is no longer the case that if matters come to a crisis with Savoy, they should expect anything from our people; their spirits are so embittered. A certain man from St. Gallen told Carlin many disgraceful things about them, and among other things, that they had thrown the leaders of the troops into chains (which I doubt is true) and want to drag city with city. I once wrote to you that my mind foresaw what dangers they would expose themselves to unless they conducted the matter vigorously; but because they are men, nothing is not to be expected from them that is expected from men. These things are commonly said: they have won the land without any sword stroke, they will lose it without any sword stroke; they have now removed the masks so that the Savoyard knows them. I could add other ridiculous jokes: they have come home fresh and healthy, except one who was frightened to death by a sheep; likewise, they stood in order for 3 days and 3 nights against a single sheep. What more? These things are said everywhere in the streets and at banquets.</p>
      <p>I defended for a while, now I am silent.</p>
      <p>I wanted you to know this, not because I think you approve, but so that you know the judgments of the common people. Farewell (reverend father in Christ) for as long and as happily as possible.</p>
      <p>Chur, October 20th, in the morning.</p>
      <p>Our people wish you well.</p>
      <p>If you cannot write in the future because of those very troublesome Brentian occupations of yours, which is not surprising, at least give this task to one of your sons, whose letters would be most welcome to me, or to Mr. Haller, who is near you, who, for his humanity, as I hope, will not deny the duty. This is the last act, as Mr. Beza writes.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since you have been so dutiful in other matters, may you also deign to weave the catastrophe.</p>
      <p>If Brentius is so prolix, you, so as not to seem to answer a fool (as the proverb goes) according to his folly, be so much the briefer.</p>
      <p>In the previous writing, you respectfully address him as Lord Brentius; this is indeed your utmost modesty, and you undoubtedly wanted to soften the man and consult for peace. But since you see that this more than bestial ferocity is to be restrained with clubs, not words, thus repel his slanders from you henceforth, so that you seem to have completely neglected the consideration of your person and his croaking. But who am I to say this to you? But thus my eagerness to converse with you and my love for you, which bids me to dare anything, carries me away.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>In the year 1562.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his always honorable father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
