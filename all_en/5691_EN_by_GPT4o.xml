      <p>S. D. I am deeply grieved, esteemed lord and dearest brother, that such a great opportunity for establishing solid and stable peace has been snatched from us by that untimely haste.</p>
      <p>For I greatly fear that this will not be lasting.</p>
      <p>Since it cannot be otherwise, we must pray to the Lord that He may heal these diseases of men, whether induced by inertia or malice.</p>
      <p>This is the Lord's cause.</p>
      <p>Nothing happens without His will.</p>
      <p>He undoubtedly wants to exercise our faith and patience in this way.</p>
      <p>And we have seen for more than 40 years how wonderfully our God has both advanced and defended the cause of religion in the world.</p>
      <p>He will not fail us who call upon His name.</p>
      <p>It is truly remarkable that Namur does not want to abandon the dead, to whom he adhered inseparably while they were alive.</p>
      <p>Oh, how much weight of scoundrels is lifted from France.</p>
      <p>It is a great miracle that in a very short time so many serious enemies of the gospel have been removed.</p>
      <p>These things did not happen in vain.</p>
      <p>The Lord still favors France, who frees it from such monsters.</p>
      <p>He will bless it even more fully in His own time.</p>
      <p>To Him be the glory.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, in my name and in the name of all the brothers, I thank you for having written so diligently about the conditions of peace and all matters.</p>
      <p>You have done a most pleasing thing for all of us.</p>
      <p>Would that it may soon be given to write of more favorable things.</p>
      <p>But both we and all our affairs are in the hand of the Lord our God.</p>
      <p>You will understand more accurately what has been done in the case of Zanchi in Strasbourg from his own letters.</p>
      <p>It seems to me that the good man acted a little imprudently and gave too much to both the enemies and the mediators, etc.</p>
      <p>It is written from Italy that the principal legates of the Council of Trent, the Mantuan, the Tridentine, and Seripando, are dead.</p>
      <p>The fathers of the council are vehemently at odds, while some want to subject the pope to the council, others prefer him, as he is not to be judged by anyone.</p>
      <p>Julius of Milan writes that they have postponed the session to April 22.</p>
      <p>Count Martinengo writes that Cardinal Lorraine returned to France through Piedmont in great sadness and with swift horses, and that the Venetians are greatly mourning the death of Guise.</p>
      <p>Our merchants have not yet returned from Frankfurt; some have returned, but they observed nothing; we expect Froschauer in these days.</p>
      <p>How much I would like the opportunity to obtain that ancient chalice of Innsbruck, which presents those pious songs about which you relate a pleasant story in your letters to me.</p>
      <p>The Poles are said to be heavily pressed by the Muscovites. May the Lord deliver them, and indeed from the Lysmannians, Blandratists, and other Italian monsters! The most pious man Tretius writes to you again about these matters; if you can do anything, do it for the sake of so many pious men in Poland.</p>
      <p>You will not lose your effort and expense.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless you and keep you safe for us for a long time! My sons, sons-in-law, relatives, brothers, and all my colleagues and my entire household greet you respectfully.</p>
      <p>My response given to Brentius will soon be reprinted; if anything seems to need changing, please let me know in time.</p>
      <p>For when I understood from your letters that you had received the book, I hope you have glanced through it.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently, my lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Greet the brothers and friends, especially Jonville.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 17, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my most honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
