      <p>Greetings. Your letter was delivered to me by one of those young men you sent here, and shortly after, the same person also delivered the money, which will be kept with me so that it can be distributed to each one as needed, when the time and situation require it. The men seem to be prudent; for they themselves immediately voluntarily indicated that their situation is so agreeable that this sum of money can suffice for half a year, and that they will not ask anything from me unless necessary use requires it from time to time. I, in turn, have encouraged them towards modesty and frugality, which they especially ought to have as their goal, whoever wishes to live among us, where the prices of things almost daily increase. They arrived at the beginning of our fair, at which time students are accustomed to take a break from their studies according to custom.</p>
      <p>Therefore, nothing could yet be done about the lectures they should attend; however, it will be arranged within three days, I hope, when the professors, freed from other cares and duties, will resume their teaching responsibilities. As for my diligence and faithfulness, I will gladly do whatever I can for them, both because of their name, as they are fellow countrymen and I trust they will be obedient, and because of you, whom I love and respect for many reasons, even if none of you had recommended them to me, because our common homeland, if nothing else, sufficiently recommends them to me as well as all others who come. Regarding other matters that you are interested in knowing, I believe our Hedio informs you thoroughly. I ask you, in turn, to greet all the brothers and fellow ministers in my name again and again. Farewell happily. Strasbourg, on the fifth day before the Ides of July, in the year 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Petrus Dasypodius.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the ZÃ¼rich church, his friend.</p>
