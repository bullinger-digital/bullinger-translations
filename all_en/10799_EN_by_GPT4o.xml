      <p>Grace and peace from God, etc.</p>
      <p>Pious, honorable, wise, favorable, dear gentlemen, since the holy Paul very earnestly indicates how one should be who is to be appointed as a pastor, from which in an honorable synod also according to the same teaching of Paul it has been decided and confirmed by our gracious lords that no one should be accepted as a preacher unless he has beforehand sufficient evidence of his conduct and life, that he has lived honorably (decently). In this regard, it has come to us from Mr. Heinrich Stoll (who was a lord and abbot at Fischingen, now residing with us in Winterthur for three years), that we (as much as we know and can speak truthfully about him) provide him with a testimonial. Herein, brotherly love compels us, as well as the truth, to give testimony of his conduct, in case he is later required to be a servant of God's word, so that one knows what his actions and omissions have been. And thus we provide him with this testimonial: As long as he has been with us in Winterthur, he has been entirely peaceful, modest, of an honorable (respectable) conduct, well-kept in God and His word, earnestly striving, without fail to promote God's word, indeed to hear God's word every day, and also to read it earnestly, etc. In summary, as far as we know with good conscience, we know nothing to reproach in his actions and omissions that would not befit a shepherd, nor is he widely wandering, has no evil or dishonorable associations. This is in the briefest form the testimonial we give him.</p>
      <p>Mathias Hirsgartter, Heinrich Lüty, servants of the word in Winterthur.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, honorable, and wise examiners in Zürich, etc.</p>
