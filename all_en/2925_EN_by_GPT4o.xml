      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, to which I would respond more fully, were I not hindered by a headache, which continues to be too familiar to me and had also severely laid me low in recent days. It is reported for certain that the Turk is about to invade Upper Hungary with a large force, which he is already ravaging with fire and sword through his light-armed cavalry, so that urgent reinforcement is needed in Vienna. However, I greatly fear that the arms are in vain, since only arms without faith and repentance are being opposed to such a powerful and fateful enemy. I have not yet learned anything from Italy, because I have not been able to meet that Theodor.</p>
      <p>The Emperor has dismissed his troops in the Netherlands, which is evidence that the expedition of Ferdinand is not intended against the evangelicals, and this is also consistently affirmed by the ambassador of the King of France, who is amazed at the baseless fear of the German princes, as Mr. Gribaldus informed me yesterday, who says he heard this from his mouth. Our soldiers have returned from Piedmont, and the captain of the cavalry entered the city not without scandal due to the arrogance and pride, which he displayed more than that of the Moabites.</p>
      <p>I foresee from those bloodthirsty ones nothing but certain ruin for the fatherland, especially when they are supported by those who ought rightly to abhor this impiety as death. May the Lord have mercy on us and grant a better mind and eyes that see more rightly.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours. Basel, 19th of May, in the year 1556.</p>
      <p>The citizens of Strasbourg have declared a truce for a year, which I do not know from where they expect wars; there are those who say that the French are plotting something against them.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>It is reported to us that among the Zugers there are still very many who are sound in faith, who do not conceal the profession of true religion despite the persecution exercised against the pastor and books, about which I wish to be informed by you at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
