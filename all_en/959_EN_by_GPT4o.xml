      <p>Our willing service, friendly greetings, and whatever we can do to honor you, dear and good, are always ready for you, pious and faithful, venerable, highly and well-learned gentlemen and beloved brothers. We have well understood your friendly letter concerning the contentious marriage matter of Ludwig Haga and Rosina Zollikofer, along with everything you have answered to our previous letter and the further report of the matter. And although we would much prefer to avoid this and other similar matters, yet, as we have previously written to you, our dear lords and brothers, out of special love, to see if we could amicably resolve the discord or displeasure that (as we were informed) had arisen between an honorable authority in St. Gallen and you, the servants of the church there, we have now also, out of the same love, promptly responded to your so friendly and earnest request and desire, to write to you this our following opinion, with a very diligent request that you may kindly accept it from us as your well-wishers.</p>
      <p>Firstly, we are well satisfied that you agree with us that a Christian authority may, for necessary reasons, establish regulations not contrary to God and His word, and that the subjects are obliged and bound to obey certain regulations.</p>
      <p>For we have not presumed to impose anything else upon you than what is proper and fair. Accordingly, we are pleased to hear that the matter and the suspicion of the aforementioned discord have been presented to us more seriously than it actually is, and we have gladly accepted that you write, not knowing that you have ever had any dispute or displeasure with your dear lords and superiors.</p>
      <p>For in the churches of Christ, it is very well when the superiors and servants of the churches work together in good and right harmony with God. On the other hand, it causes much destruction and evil in the communities when they, without necessity, are embittered and fight against each other.</p>
      <p>But as you inform us that your lords and superiors have not accepted the forbidden degrees, especially in the second and third lines of blood relations, of the thirty-third year of the lesser count from our gracious lords of Zurich along with other Christian authorities, but have reserved them with some additions, we have not known this until now, nor have we received any other report that these regulations are equally accepted and practiced by you and us. We are very surprised that you or yours have held a special position in such a reasonable and necessary matter of this time, to which yours have also adhered in the recently passed forty-ninth year. However, we leave this to rest in all good.</p>
      <p>And now we come to the main point, where you seek our advice on how to handle the matter, as if the aforementioned persons, who had previously entered into marriage, where the prohibition of the third degree was not yet accepted or imposed by you, come to a legal recognition, to resolve their conscience, what then they should and may answer to God and their good conscience concerning themselves and their souls, etc. We consider that, since the matter has come into doubt, dispute, and question, it should be clarified, pronounced, and completed by no one more appropriately than before court and council, since God has entrusted such contentious matters to judgment and law in His word. Therefore, our advice is that you direct the persons there. The Christian judge will (God willing) know well what has been forbidden or not forbidden by you so far, whether this matter falls under the prohibition or not, what has been allowed to others or not, or why, or whether this matter is similar to the previous ones or what the present time requires, etc. For we do not want nor should we judge here. But it is customary with us: what has happened without danger and before the accepted regulation, has been left undisturbed. There your judges will also be able to assess what is appropriate or not, etc. And if it should happen that by a judgment of the much-mentioned authority the aforementioned Haga is separated from Zollikofer, as the authority dissolves the promise of both due to the third degree and other marital reasons and does not want to let it stand, we do not think that they should make a conscience for themselves in this, that they should follow the clarification of their proper authority, to which they have submitted themselves, and marry in another way.</p>
      <p>So you, our beloved lords and brothers, will have little reason to oppose the judgment that has been passed and to instill a conscience in the two persons, as if they could not marry elsewhere with God. For if you have not unreasonably allowed the authority of the past year to prohibit the third degree of blood relationship to everyone, why would you then want to involve yourselves further in this case against their judgment? Especially since the authority (as we are informed) has seriously dealt with warnings and prohibitions against these two persons for a long time and has clearly indicated to them that such a promise will not be allowed to stand, and even if the second or third degree of blood relationship is not explicitly mentioned in the law of Moses, you know well, 1 that Moses especially considered his followers, 2 also how much we Christians are bound to the judicial laws. 3 You know that the law of public decency does not conflict with the word of God. 4 You know how far the word of Paul reaches: "All things are lawful for me, but not all things are beneficial," etc. It might also come to this case (as we will also be informed in addition) that the daughter, when she first promised herself, was not of age, that she promised herself against those to whom she was bound by divine and natural rights, but you know well what fairness demands here. Therefore, it is our unanimous, brotherly advice that you amicably resolve the matter with the persons in this case, so that they do not proceed in such a marriage, which has come into serious dispute and suspicion, from which much more offense and harm than good benefit might arise, that they entrust the matter to God and, since a judgment has been passed, set their hearts at peace. With this, we hope, neither you nor they will anger God. God be with you; may He keep you in His grace, and we assure you of all services, love, and friendship at all times.</p>
      <p>We also thank you for all your love and friendly offers. Dated Zurich, the fourth day of July in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Your always willing pastors and readers of the Holy Scriptures, servants of the church of Zurich.</p>
