      <p>God be with us, beloved son, I have no news at this time. I attribute this to the usual cold and impassable roads, but we are expecting news and letters from the fair in Strasbourg, Heidelberg, and Basel any day now.</p>
      <p>For the past three weeks, I have also not received any letters from Nuremberg, nor for some time from St. Gallen, and since the day in Baden, nothing from Bern, Geneva, or Lyon. Therefore, I cannot write to you about these matters. From Chur, they write to me that there are troops in Como and Milan, which are believed to have come from the sea; for the Venetian, Spanish, and Papal fleets have returned home from the sea without accomplishing anything. Here you have a letter that came to me from Padua; you may share it with my esteemed lord Doctor Burgower and should greet him sincerely for me; but please send the letter back to me promptly, so that I may respond to the excellent man at the first opportunity; he is a Pole, a very learned man and the tutor of the young Palatine from Poland, etc. Burckart, the messenger, has come from Lorraine these days; he says there is a rumor that the king was defeated before La Rochelle and has replaced the city's coat of arms with the English one, which I do not yet believe. Perhaps these things are said to gain greater favor with the king, as if he is now forced to reclaim what is rightfully his. You have something about this in the letters of the most distinguished man, Dr. François Hotman, who was a royal law professor in Orléans. However, make sure to return these letters of Hotman to Dr. Lasicii with certainty.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor that the Duke of Savoy has made a small attack on the Bernese and has secretly handed over the three bailiwicks, which he received back from the Bernese, to the King of France, which I do not yet believe; it is now a street rumor.</p>
      <p>God be with you. All my people send their greetings to you all. January 8th, amidst many affairs, 1573.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>May God grant our Lord S. much happiness. I have not heard from him, whether he is here; if he comes, I will arrange with Josua and him what you desire. But you look and do not delay. Greet Susanna and the children.</p>
      <p>It is said to be certain that the unruly people in France have now made peace with the king within a month; he is completely innocent, and the admiral is the greatest wrongdoer. Artes. Scatter, O Lord, the people who delight in war...</p>
      <p>To my beloved son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
