      <p>Greetings. In recent days, most learned Bullinger, our mutual friend, as I see it, Johannes Vogler, the most vigilant steward of our prince, delivered to me, as he reported, in your name, the most elegant and at the same time most pious letter of the illustrious Vadianus on the conjunction of the body of Christ with the word, along with the books of the divine Vigilius, which are beyond controversy pious. Nothing could have happened more undeservedly pleasing and acceptable to me, who expected nothing of the sort from such a learned and pious man. But since the Muses are most closely joined with the Graces in familiarity, indeed bound together by an indissoluble bond, I cease to wonder that you, the high priest of the Muses, deem me, who scarcely greet the Muses from the threshold, worthy of your friendship. Therefore, lest I seem entirely unmusical and alien to the Graces, it seemed right to me to address you again with these my humble letters and, if there is anything in my meager possessions from which you might someday conveniently benefit, to offer it to you with a completely sincere heart. Indeed, you have bound Sigismund to you with this most elegant gift, so that he can never repay you, nor do I have anything worthy to return for this gift and your spirit towards me, except myself, whom, if you consider of any value, you may entirely assign to your own possession.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, most illustrious man, I earnestly ask you, as diligently as I can, to assist this letter bearer, Heinrich Hofstetter, your fellow citizen, who served as our prince's French secretary for two years, with your prayers before your council whenever he solicits you, and to have him commended in my name. He promises perpetual repentance and never to commit anything against the public decree; therefore, I consider him worthy of pardon.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man, and command me as your humble client; you will find me most ready for anything. Also, I ask you to greet my distinguished lord and friend Erasmus Fabritius and all the brothers, adamantine cultivators of the word.</p>
      <p>From Montbéliard, 26th of October in the year of the Virgin birth 1539. Yours at the altar,</p>
      <p>Sigismund Stier.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished bishop of the most illustrious city of Zürich, Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed lord and friend.</p>
