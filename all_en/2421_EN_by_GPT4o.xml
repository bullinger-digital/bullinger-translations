      <p>Greetings were pleasing to me, but very sad, most learned Bullinger, because they did not provide what I most wanted, namely the state of Swiss affairs; for what many desire, I greatly fear, that you may fall into mutual dissensions like the leaders of Germany, who have brought things to such a state through mutual distrust, that even if they wanted to, but they do not yet want to, they could not prevent the future downfall of the empire. It usually happens that when we look to private matters, we obtain neither the public nor the private; for how will the private stand if the public is neglected? This is what the leading princes are aiming for, almost all the Saxons, enticed by the sweetness of rich stipends, depend on the English, the same is done by almost all the Brunswickers, evangelicals no less than papists and several margraves.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is now over for the liberty of the empire. May the Lord grant a tolerable servitude of bodies, so that at least some freedom of consciences may remain surviving; but this is in great danger.</p>
      <p>They say the Bernese are more inclined to expand the empire and make more profit than to preserve either the doctrine of the gospel or to retain the Swiss liberty obtained with much blood. Snares are being laid for you from all sides; but perhaps lulled to sleep in both ears, you will perish by sleeping.</p>
      <p>You see before you what is to come and how close destruction is; but what remedies are being prepared for the present diseases? I very much wish to know what is threatening you; the worst opposing party threatens, desires, and prepares anything.</p>
      <p>I am sending you letters through my son, who wishes you, along with Gessner and Gwalter and the entire literary and ecclesiastical fellowship, to be very well, sent to me today from Italy. If you wish to reply, make sure I have it; they will be delivered to Italy sooner than to ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>In Worms, the state of religion is very bad; for that boar of Chaelidon, Eduard Schnepf, has remonstrated with Philipp and Brenz and almost all others and accused them of Zwinglian, as he calls it, heresy, and could not be appeased by any sounder advice, but when asked, he began to rage more and more. This schism among us, the papist plague, while they immediately thought... and they adapted this to themselves and their cause, for this reason they made a law that no one should converse with the evangelicals anymore, unless the evangelicals with one voice condemned Zwinglianism and excluded themselves from the Augsburg Confession. The envoys of the princes and all the pious were disturbed. Georg Soldin, formerly the imperial vice-chancellor, now the Bavarian counselor, wrote this to encourage the Duke of Bavaria in his purpose, and adds that the colloquy will either be dissolved immediately by the dissension of the Lutherans or will be very long-lasting, but both with great honor and benefit to the Catholics.</p>
      <p>I give immortal thanks for the most learned book on the Apocalypse; the sacramental booklet also pleased me greatly; I wish it to be read by the leading princes and this advice to be followed.</p>
      <p>I fear more for the end of the gospel in Saxony than in the middle of Bavaria. I earnestly ask you to inform me what is to be predicted about the danger surrounding the Frenchman, and whether there is any hope that he can either extricate himself or retaliate.</p>
      <p>I know the Frenchman, what his mind is towards religion, how insolent, proud, and rash the French are; but I would not want him to succumb, lest his fall cause us and the common cause to fall. I am already very sad and anxious about the future destruction of the gospel.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most learned Bullinger, and reply quickly. The Bavarian alliance with the new bride, namely the Franconian alliance, was here these days. In Augsburg very quickly. October 9th, in the year etc. 54.</p>
      <p>G[ereon] y[ours].</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, lord and friend to be honored with perpetual veneration.</p>
