      <p>Fran√ßois Hotman sends greetings.</p>
      <p>I hope that my letters have been delivered to you, which I entrusted to our Budaeus in Geneva 20 days ago, in which I informed you of my planned journey to Strasbourg. Since that time, I have brought my family here, where I am waiting for both the ship and my belongings, enduring a great delay. Basel was not known to me before, although I had often heard much about it. I especially approve of Sulcer and Mr. Amorbach, as well as our Gratarolus, and I have no doubt that there are many others whose integrity and religion are pleasing to God. But most people are so devoted and fond of Castellio that they believe religion and piety are supported by this Atlas, as it were. What I said to the printer of the French Bible about the man's foolishness, with the inept audacity or rather favoritism of the translator, is known to many. When some asked me to explain the foolishness of the preface, I dictated this little note to my scribe, which I have enclosed in this letter. If it were possible, I would greatly wish for the preface to be changed. It will seem very ridiculous to the French courtiers, especially if read casually. However, Calvin is no better spoken of here than Luther. If anyone reproaches someone for swearing or being wanton, they are called a "Calvinist" as an insult. Finally, let the church of Geneva be defended, which maintains a unique and truly Christian discipline. We have been told by the Spaniards who come from there that the King of England has come to Brussels and brought with him a great number of English nobility. The Pope is said to be entering into an alliance with the Turk, urged by Prince Sultan, and with joined forces, they are attacking the Emperor. When I left there, Mr. Calvin was suffering from severe pain in his side; from this, the doctor feared he might have pleurisy. I ask you to console him; for he is being barked at from all sides most annoyingly and monstrously; you know well enough whom I mean. Please convey my respectful and honorable greetings to the most illustrious Mr. Gesner, your two sons-in-law, both very learned and courteous men, and also to Mr. Lismanini, a man of exceptional piety and virtue. Reverend Father, farewell, most illustrious and most esteemed father. Basel, September 29, 1555.</p>
