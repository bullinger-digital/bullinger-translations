      <p>While I was writing this, my dear Bullinger, I had been confined to bed for four days, and my little body, now in its sixty-fifth year, had barely risen from the little bed, and I am compelled to write. Therefore, I beseech you, if there is any error, interpret it better.</p>
      <p>This I pray: It is enough for me; please, take my soul. Let the will of the Lord be done. To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, theologian of Zürich, his esteemed lord, etc. Zürich.</p>
