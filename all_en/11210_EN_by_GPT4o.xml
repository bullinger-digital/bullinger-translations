    <p xml:id="regest1">Writes because he feels obliged to advocate for the Concord. The reason for his previous letter was Vadian's communication that Luther's latest letter was met with concerns, upon which he wanted to find out more details. That Luther does not fully trust the Swiss should not be surprising, as they have always secured themselves with reservations and it is still preached that Christ is not present in the Lord's Supper. Calls for wise action and brotherly thinking of one another to complete the Concord.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Beloved and esteemed brothers, always dear to me, I know that when I write to you about the common affairs of the church, I am fulfilling my duty, which you are certainly not unaware of. If only we all acted in such a way as those who with zeal, faith, diligence, and utmost vigilance attend to the most important matters.</p>
      <p>I know, brothers, if this harmony turns into discord for us, Satan has not wasted his efforts in mocking us. I confess to you: There must be the utmost and most steadfast care that the truth is maintained; but equally, there must be the utmost care, brothers, that the harmony of the church is restored. Therefore, whatever I write to you so earnestly, imploring and arguing, I beseech you by the Lord, do not think of me as someone insignificant or as no one at all, who writes this. I know who moves my heart, who moves my tongue; I know who it is that contends with you through me. Certainly, if I am planning or attempting anything malicious, I know the Lord will soon bring all our plans to light, not only exposing them to ridicule but also destroying them.</p>
      <p>Regarding what I wrote recently, it did not emerge from an obscure corner. For Vadian, our mutual friend, indeed a mutual friend of his homeland and religion, wrote that he senses a new fire, a new offense, that once again the faith of those who act with us is coming into danger with you, unless the letters written by Luther find a fair interpreter among you. Therefore, I wanted to know what offends in these matters, so that by removing what offends, we could better fortify ourselves against the wiles of Satan. You have the reason for my recent letter.</p>
      <p>Regarding the offense that arose from Luther's latest letter, I will speak briefly. To be honest about what I feel, it seems to me that what Luther does, he does out of necessity. For what else have we ever done in this whole agreement of harmony, but, having little trust in Luther, guarded ourselves against him in a thousand ways? The medium for mending harmony was our confession. When did we ever send it to him without the most copious and circumspect interpretation? This was rightly done at the beginning, and I also diligently contributed to making it happen. But when this is always done, even in the very last union of harmony, what else can Luther think but that those who continually use exceptions are not truly inclined towards harmony? What wonder is it, then, if, being entirely cautious of him, he in turn thought he should be cautious of us? Was not his previous letter simple, clear, friendly, and holy enough? What, brothers, that in your sermons it is still publicly said and repeated that Christ is not present in the Lord's Supper, here, here he is not, if indeed this is what we hear from the most serious men? Therefore, we must, brothers, act diligently, and with suspicions set aside, think brotherly of one another. I swear by the Lord, if we do this, we will not lose the harmony begun without any offense to the truth.</p>
      <p>I beseech you by the love of Christ Jesus, to bear with me, your brother, who is ready to share his soul with you.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your Simon Grynäus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious men, the brothers in Zürich, professing the Lord.</p>
