      <p>What you wish to know about the colloquy and its progress, I will not let you remain ignorant of what I know, though I would prefer to say little, but better things. When at the end of August both parties finally gathered in Worms, the envoys sent by Duke Friedrich of Saxony revealed to our people, who stand by the Augsburg Confession, the orders of their prince, not to agree to a colloquy with them before they have subscribed to their condemnations, which they had exercised with the consent of their princes, condemning the Zwinglian, Osiandrian, adiaphoristic, Majorican, Anabaptist, and Schwenckfeldian heresies, etc.</p>
      <p>Those who brought forth this evil to Palladius were Mr. Erhard Snephius, Victorinus Strigel, and the politician Mr. Basilius Monner, to whom was added Mr. Martin Joachim of Brunswick, a fierce hater of Osiander, who had long been expelled from Prussia due to his factious vehemence. Our people deprecated this contention and did not agree to the prejudices of the parties, nor did they refuse to listen, and they prayed that these matters be suspended and postponed to other times, places, and persons, or after the public colloquy, so that the common controversy with the papists, for which they were summoned, might be conducted with common, useful, and more honest effort. For this reason, our most illustrious prince writes and entreats the Saxon princes not to dissolve the common colloquy because of the private contentions of their people, and sends Mr. Theodor Snephius to mitigate the party and lead them away from obstinacy.</p>
      <p>But all in vain.</p>
      <p>Finally, the Saxon princes recall those of their people whom I mentioned, to return home, disregarding ours.</p>
      <p>They did this not without ignominious disgrace. For having received letters commanding their departure, I hear they reported to the president and the papists, in which the princes wrote that the reasons for their recall seemed just to them and hoped to be approved by those, as our people had fallen into intolerable heresies, which they either reconcile or attempt to introduce by dissimulation or refuse to consent to the condemnations, not allowing their people to converse with such, nor accept what is established in the congress of the colloquy, etc.</p>
      <p>Having exposed these matters before the papists and immediately refusing, they departed without greeting the others. Our people still linger, suffused with shame and embarrassment.</p>
      <p>The papists consider themselves to have fulfilled the duty of their legation, refusing to proceed with the colloquy as a good part of the prince's party departs and refuses this action; we are discordant, and it is unknown what concord or reconciliation can be hoped for. What was reported to us, I could write to you.</p>
      <p>We are expecting Mr. Jakob Beurlin soon, whom our best prince had sent there a few days ago to assist those dissolving; if he comes, we will learn more. It grieves me, and the pious are saddened by this confusion; for there was great hope among many princes for consensus in the Augsburg Confession and thus the union of minds. But the adversary, through ambition, as he is proud, and the spirit of discord, envied a more prosperous outcome. Those Saxons think the principality pertains to them as the electorate and the purity of doctrine, which began in Wittenberg.</p>
      <p>How they do this, perhaps with such fortune as with the pursuit of modesty and concord. You have what torments us and especially our best prince.</p>
      <p>But the Palatine Elector also received a sad wound, for Mr. Heinrich Stola and a political senator, whose name I do not hold, having entered the baths, were immediately seized by a deadly illness and brought back to Heidelberg, where they passed away the next day; they are thought to have been poisoned, but to whom this blame is attributed, I do not hear.</p>
      <p>These are from the autograph letter of Johannes Eisemann, which was delivered on November 8.</p>
      <p>Due to my health, I could barely write this on my little bed. Pray for me.</p>
      <p>The following letter was sent to me by Mr. Matthias Erbius, pastor of Riquewihr in Alsace, in November 1557.</p>
