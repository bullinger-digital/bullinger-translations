      <p>To the most esteemed lords and dearest brothers in Christ, the dean and brothers of the Steckborn class in Thurgau.</p>
      <p>Greetings. We are very sorry, believe us most esteemed lords and dearest brothers in Christ, that you, who otherwise ought to be most united, are in discord. Whoever has caused this discord will give an account to the Lord, who from the heart detests and abhors a tongue sowing discord among brothers. The main cause of your discord seems to be that a few, acting on their own authority and private judgment, have used the public commission of your class to cover their rashness and have requested through me a synod and examination from the most honorable magistrate of this city.</p>
      <p>However, the matter is quite different.</p>
      <p>Some brothers came here, who reported on behalf of your class that a public edict had been issued by the president, commanding pastors to openly require solemn prayers and a confession of faith, as well as other catechism from even the older ones, which indeed disturbs even the best; therefore, the brothers seek advice on how to conduct themselves in this otherwise difficult matter. We, who serve this church in Zürich, thought it most appropriate to communicate this matter to the most distinguished men, the consul and senators joined to the synod; for at that time, when they were present, the synod had already begun, which seemed to be the ministers' advice without the work of the most honorable magistrate... in some way. Therefore, I, as an interpreter, proposed this matter to the most honorable consul and deputies in the presence of my lords and brothers, Mr. Gwalther and Mr. Wolph, in the name of the class.</p>
      <p>Since for a long time it has rightly grieved the best of men that anyone, neither examined nor called, should intrude into the sacred ministry through the churches of Thurgau and live in it without discipline, as soon as the former matter was proposed to the most honorable consul and senators, I added also that (which I did not add from the commission of the class) the more renowned brothers and ministers of the churches in Thurgau, although we do not doubt some will oppose, wish for the restoration of discipline. This matter, in our opinion, cannot be more conveniently obtained than if a legitimate synod is restored to you, in which then, with the advice of the brothers, examination and other necessary matters can be dealt with. The most honorable consul kindly promised with the senators to devote all their efforts to this matter, so that what is beneficial to the churches may be cared for. I have explained all these things more fully to our faithful and beloved brother, the minister of the Steckborn church, who will explain in more detail what we have briefly touched upon here. We therefore urge you to return to harmony with the brothers, who have done nothing against you, and to take kindly what we have done with a fatherly spirit and a desire to help you and your churches. Farewell, most esteemed and dearest brothers in the Lord Christ.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Zürich, October 20, 1557.</p>
      <p>Bullinger in his own name and in the name of the other pastors in the city of Zürich.</p>
