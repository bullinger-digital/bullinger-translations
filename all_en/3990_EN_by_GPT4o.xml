      <p>Greetings. With what faith letters are received and delivered in this most wretched age, dearest brother and co-father in the Lord, Bullinger, good men experience more than enough. I have already written to you about my commentaries on both epistles of the Apostle to the Corinthians and about the gift sent to Heinrich, our godson; however, to whom those letters were entrusted, I cannot recall, hindered by the vice of old age. I also received from you what you published on the articles of the Bavarian examination, which I also heard Melanchthon criticized in his public lectures.</p>
      <p>I rarely write, I confess; but friends must consider how sluggish and slow old age is, and they must forgive if any duty is lacking, which I do not doubt you also do. I read what you wrote to Mr. Haller, my co-father, about the sacramental dispute held at the University of Heidelberg. I pray to the Lord that what has been happily begun may also be happily advanced.</p>
      <p>If you have received anything more certain about this matter, I pray you share it. If the Elector Prince is pious and a lover of truth, I am thinking of dedicating my "Loci" to him for certain reasons, in which matter you could assist me. Viret's irritation will achieve nothing else than to further corrode his own heart with its bitterness.</p>
      <p>It must not be conceded, as he thinks, that the Church of Christ cannot exist unless it is established according to the discipline conceived by them. But you know this better.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently, dearest co-father.</p>
      <p>Greet Bibliander, Peter Martyr, Bernardino, Walther, and the others along with your household. Your godson Heinrich greets you.</p>
      <p>Bern, 1559, June 12.</p>
      <p>Your Musculus.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his co-father in the Lord, by far the dearest.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
