      <p> Greetings. I have received all your letters through the public minister of your city, Thomilium, and I thank you for them; for I have not yet seen the letters of Pfiffer or Heyden. However, I did not gladly read in the interpreter's letters that he so hatefully criticizes and slanders the people of Geneva. You know otherwise that the illustrious city of Geneva is exposed to the hatred of many beyond its merit; I would not want our imprudence to increase this hatred, and therefore the name of the Genevans should be concealed, and the new things I send should not be rashly believed by everyone, nor should it be revealed from where we have them. But not everything comes to us from Geneva; these things are written from many other places, such as from Bern, from Basel, from where indeed is what I last sent. Therefore, be careful in the future that these men do not know, to the detriment of good people, what and from where we have these matters. Siderhar and I have sent you the Basel writings, it is heard that the large troop from the Dauphiné has not camped before Lyon, but has divided, and part of them have gone to Valence to protect the land there from invasion; the other part has moved towards Champagne, following the prince. From Montbéliard it is written on December 27: The Duke of Guise has placed 3 companies of foot soldiers and a squadron of cavalry in the town of Pont, to prevent the advance that the admiral is leading to the prince. The admiral has summoned the town; they have answered that they do not have the time now. Thereupon the admiral bombarded, stormed, and captured it, killing over 600 inside, and as he moved on to Sens, Guise was at a ball game. But as soon as he heard the news, he rose and made his way to Troyes. The Lord of Muy pursued him and finally caught up, sending 56 red coats to the prince, those who were slain. From Troyes, early in the morning, Guise, the cardinal, Aumale, and the grandmother fled to Saint-Dizier. Meanwhile, the prince and admiral hurried to Sedan and Espargney on the river Marne, 5 miles from Reims and 7 miles from Châlons, and the prince's forces have driven Guise's to Verdun on the Meuse, where the black riders are also rushing, and there is talk as if something significant might happen with Guise's forces, etc. </p>
      <p> And as I write this, Dr. Thaddeus arrives, shows me a letter from Basel from Mr. Francisco Betty, freshly written, that the prince and the Germans have come together at Pontemos, and as they moved towards France within 2 miles, the king's escort came to Cardinal Castiglione, to negotiate peace, and the king has agreed to the articles; only now they are negotiating the assurance of peace, etc. If it were true that peace was made, it would be the best news. May God have mercy on them and us and grant a good peace! The mandate that I send here is sent to learn whether the king will allow freedom of faith or not. A good friend from Lucerne gave it to a citizen here. If peace were made, the mandate would be void. I write all this in haste, commending you to God. Greet for me Mr. Mayor, Captain Carlin, Pontasella, Ganthner, and all our friends. God be with you. Whatever further comes to me, I will let you know, giving it to you as I receive it; believing you, as much as it concerns you. I can well tell you where I have it from, but not that it is certainly so, by which I stand, etc. God be with you. January 16, 1568. </p>
      <p> Yours, Heinrich Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. </p>
      <p> Chur. </p>
