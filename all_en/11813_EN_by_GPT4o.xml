    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends the anatomical work ["De humani corporis fabrica"] by [Andreas] Vesalius, who is just departing to Emperor [Charles V] in Speyer. Corrects the previous price information for the "Epitome" and the main work; Vesalius, who sends his regards to Bullinger, leaves it to him to decide how much he wants to pay for it; Gast will also send him the German summary upon request as soon as it is published, and regrets not being able to gift him the entire work. Disapproves of the proposal by the Basel pastors that the council should allow students to beg from door to door, as was done earlier under the papacy; where have the revenues from the church properties gone? Greetings; assumes that the "Epitome" has arrived at Bullinger's.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I am sending the anatomical work by Quirinus, the esteemed Vesalius, who at this moment is preparing for his journey; he will descend to Speyer to the Emperor, if he remains there, to whom he dedicated the work. Farewell.</p>
      <p>I made an error in the previous pricing: the Epitome is 10 batz, the main work 4 florins and 4Â½ batz. Master Vesalius told me that you should give as much as you want, and he will not sell it to the booksellers for any other price than the one prescribed here, and he sends you his warmest regards. If you wish for the German Epitome, I will send it shortly; it is not yet completed. I will pay a gold coin, as I wrote before; you will provide the remaining sum of money. If my means were not so limited, I would have bought the entire work with my own money and gifted it to you.</p>
      <p>But hey, our pastors have consulted and proposed to the senate that the senate should allow students to collect bread from door to door, as was done under the papacy. I am very displeased with this. Where have the church properties' revenues gone, where the monastery's income? Oh, the times! Farewell. More on this in the next letter. August 2, 1543.</p>
      <p>Greet Master Theodor and your wife. I believe you have already received the Latin Epitome long ago.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother. Zurich.</p>
