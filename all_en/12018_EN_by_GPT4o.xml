    <p xml:id="regest1">Regrets the inconveniences caused by the sending of his letters, which are due to the inappropriate behavior of his and Vadian's messenger; wishes to cover the costs incurred. In France, there are said to have been severe losses; according to the delegation of the Duke of Ferrara [Ercole II d'Este] sent to him for mediation and rejected by him, the Emperor [Charles V] is only thinking of conquering France. Sends back [Martin] Frecht's letter; Blarer should inform him that Zwingli's writings will be published without delay; Bullinger is surprised by Frecht's attitude and advice in this matter, especially since Zwingli, no less than others, fought against the Antichrist and his teachings could not be refuted; one cannot prevent the reissue of Zwingli's works while Luther's polemical writings continue to be printed; the people of Zurich will certainly defend their teachings with Christ's help, but they are not quarrelsome; moreover, Bullinger is hardly involved in the new edition of Zwingli's writings; he will at most write Zwingli's vita, should no one more suitable be found for it. [Nikolaus von] Amsdorf continues to incite Luther, formerly against Erasmus, now against [Hermann von Wied] and Bucer; Wittenberg has become a new Rome; human attempts at unification have failed; now the truth must be sought; that it is precisely the people of Wittenberg who are resuming the dispute is certainly God's guidance; Blarer knows what happened between Luther and [Christoph] Froschauer; he should report this to Frecht, and the latter should not show himself so devoted to Luther! Lecture notes on the Apocalypse exist only in excerpts; however, Bullinger will forward the request to [Theodor] Bibliander; but he can promise nothing in this regard. [Andreas] Osiander sets the Last Judgment in his [„Coniecturae de ultimis temporibus“] for the year 1688; Bullinger lends Blarer the „Speculum“; he asks the latter to recommend him [Hans] Welser. Has fulfilled his task regarding [Jakob Ruf] and admonished him to write to his sister-in-law [...]. Greetings. The messenger [Alban Hamman] left Zurich without the present letter.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I am very sorry for the kind of insult that was inflicted on you, honorable man, by that messenger, and I beg you not to blame me or be angry with me. If this kind of people were not as they are, they would not be messengers. I had given those letters of yours to our messenger going to St. Gallen and had entrusted him with nothing else than to ask Mr. Vadianus in my name to send them to Constance through some suitable courier. But as far as I understand from your letters, he pressed the matter so much that our excellent Vadianus sent his own messenger to you. Thus, they are either inconveniently officious or stubbornly obstinate. However, whatever the case may be, I will in good faith and willingly pay whatever you have given to this courier with little convenience, and I ask you not to hide from me what you have spent.</p>
      <p>We have no certain news from France yet. A rumor had spread that the armies had clashed and many thousands of brave men were lost on both sides; the night interrupted the battle. But last night, the envoys of the Duke of Ferrara, returning home, passed through the city, who had been in the imperial camp for eight days, sent there by the prince to negotiate peace.</p>
      <p>However, they were received with little friendliness and found the emperor cruel and implacable; they return home having suffered a rejection. The emperor has already devoured all of France in hope.</p>
      <p>I am returning Frecht's letters as you requested and respond briefly to them: As you know, all of Zwingli's works are being printed, and there is no way to prevent them from being published. A good part of them have been printed with great labor and expense; the rest are being added, and I truly wonder at Frecht's advice and judgment. Zwingli wrote the truth and attacked and defeated the Antichrist more strongly and successfully with his writings than many others. Who then will prevent useful, learned, and pious books from being published? The doctrine of Zwingli has not yet been convicted of error, so the edition should not be prohibited, nor should we be ashamed of the books. But many contentious writings about the sacrament will be published at the same time, which he wrote against Luther and others. Why should they not be published? Luther's confession against Oecolampadius and Zwingli was published in Wittenberg once and again, and finally in the year 1534 and other times; Luther's works are printed, and no one protests. He writes against the living and the dead, which is commanded not by reason but by fury, and he does not sin. But we sin when we publish Zwingli's useful and holy works with the most modest prefaces, from which no one will take occasion for contention, except those who, as they say, seek a quarrel from a tired person. The people of Wittenberg should not hope that this edition will be hindered, unless perhaps God does not want it; about which we are not at all anxious. However, Mr. Frecht, our common friend, rightly writes that the people of Zurich defend their doctrine; for if he means the doctrine of the supper, of abolishing the mass, of confession and absolution, of images, of the power of the keys, etc., we certainly defend it and, as long as this spirit rules these limbs, we will defend it against the pope, Luther, the Anabaptists, and the Schwenckfeldians, not relying on our own strength but on the strength and help of Christ. Thus indeed Bullinger breathes and hopes for victory, because Christ is victory and the truth of the Lord remains forever [Ps. 117 (Vulg. 116), 2]; otherwise, I am not eager for battle, as Christ, who sees the hearts of all, knows. Again, I will not refuse battle if the glory of Christ requires it. I contribute nothing at all to the edition of Zwingli's works; there are others who have taken that labor upon themselves; I have only promised the life of the author, unless they find a better writer, which they can easily do, etc. Therefore, the excellent Frecht is mistaken when he thinks that I am burning and breathing, desiring and longing for battles; indeed, I hate them, unless they are just.</p>
      <p>Amsdorff once also incited Luther against Erasmus; now he incites him against the Cologne or Bucer. What will all the pious say here? That Wittenberg has become a new Rome; for unless a conference is held with the most holy and with his counselors, the truth is not the truth.</p>
      <p>But leaving these things aside, let us say and confess what is true: Hitherto, concord has been attempted by human counsels. Some doctrines have been bent and twisted. But the Lord, rejecting that lukewarmness, wants either hot or cold. Therefore, he excites the minds of men everywhere, so that they may come to a more diligent search for the truth, and by the wonderful counsel of God, it happens that the people of Wittenberg are restoring the fight.</p>
      <p>You know that we do not stir up disputes, most fair Ambrosius, but suppress just causes of anger, bear injuries patiently, so as not to cause disturbances; meanwhile, there are always those who urge us to peace. No one restrains Luther, the author of all disturbances; everything he says and does more than insolently and petulantly is attributed to his heroic spirit. Where then is the judgment of the brothers?</p>
      <p>Where is equity and justice? God indeed sees these things and will require them. You know what business Luther had with Froschauer; I know none, except that he wrote letters to him about us. Since Frecht is unaware of this, I beg you to make sure he does not remain ignorant, so that he too may begin to recognize the heroic virtues of the most reverend; for otherwise, he seems to be more than sufficiently devoted to Luther.</p>
      <p>We have no dictations on the Apocalypse, but only excerpts. However, I will communicate the request to Bibliander, and if it can be done with his good permission, I will attempt something; although I promise you nothing explicitly here.</p>
      <p>For it is a vast work, and I have not easily found a writer; for he has encompassed the whole theology of Christ and the entire order of times in that book.</p>
      <p>Osiander in his inflated book says that the Last Judgment will be in the year 1688. Here you have the "Speculum," but on the condition that you return it to me by the next messenger.</p>
      <p>Please commend me diligently to Mr. Welser. I thank you for taking care of my affairs with such diligence.</p>
      <p>This evening, when I was returning home late and knew nothing yet of your matters, I met the surgeon, to whom I explained the business entrusted to me with utmost faith. He replied: "That has also been written to me and just the same. I have done them good, helped and given; but it helps nothing. I know well what the law is here and in Constance; it will not go as they think," etc. And after a long time, he agreed that he would put his answer in writing and send it to her. Therefore, I am writing this now around 9 at night, I cannot know when the pot will go away tomorrow and whether he has written. Yet I will urge him and beg you to consider this my service as good.</p>
      <p>I wrote very hastily and while about to sleep, because I have slept little for three nights; therefore, take these things kindly. May the Lord Jesus keep you. Greet the most pious men Mr. Consul, your brother, and Mr. Zwick with the brothers, especially your household.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 5th of September, at the 9th hour and 1st watch of the night. H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>What you see attached here, I had written thinking I had a courier; but he had left. Therefore, he was conveniently offered here.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord to give peace to his church in the pastors, so that they do not quarrel among themselves to the great detriment of the flock.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, venerable and beloved lord and brother.</p>
