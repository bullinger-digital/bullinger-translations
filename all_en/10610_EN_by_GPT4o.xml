    <p xml:id="regest1">His silence means as little as that of Bullinger. Thanks for letters [No. 562 and 563]; [the people of Konstanz] will prepare themselves with the arguments of Bullinger and Pellicanus for the upcoming visit of Bucer. Bucer has promised not to further support the concord plans [of the French king]; if only Germany would understand that [Francis I] is solely concerned with his own advantage! The opinions [of Melanchthon and Bucer] are ill-considered. Under the influence of the Church Fathers, Bucer considers ceremonies useful, but the Kingdom of God can only be promoted through the preaching of the Gospel. External discipline is to be ensured by the authorities, ceremonies at most lead to hypocrisy. Besides the inner governance of the Word and the external governance of the authorities, there is no third way; the discipline of ceremonies has proven to be a Trojan horse. Zwick agrees with Bullinger's opinion about the French king and sends a pasquinade. Has heard nothing from Ambrosius [Blarer]. Nothing reliable is known about the army assembled in Meran. Asks for leniency for Bucer. Greetings. Would prefer to engage in oral exchange in the bath at Urdorf.</p>

      <p>Salvation and peace of Christ.</p>
      <p>I am not surprised if you are sometimes silent, dearest brother, since I know that when you are silent, there is nothing worthy to write or that I should know. Judge my silence in the same way.</p>
      <p>What you wrote to Bucer was very pleasing and the reading of it was most gratifying. For this is how things stand regarding the sacrament and the nature of the councils. I would like to see what Bucer will respond to you. Then, what you wrote to me, I read with pleasure, and I certainly owe you more for this than I could ever repay. I hope Bucer will be here within a month. From your and Pellicanus' arguments, we will steal some things to be better prepared when we deal with him. I am returning your notes, but not Pellicanus'; it was impossible for me to copy them at this time, but they will follow.</p>
      <p>Bucer, a very good man, has written another apology, but not a sharp one, in which he openly gives us hope that he will not pursue the cause of concord. Thanks be to God for this; not everyone is so tractable. We here persistently maintain that the King of France seeks nothing but what is his own, and that out of hatred for the Emperor and under the pretext of obtaining a council for the Germans. If only, if only Germany would be wise!</p>
      <p>Furthermore, nothing has so far offended good people as much as those given councils, and the more we consider the use and outcome of such councils, the more these ill-considered thoughts displease us. But we hope that Christ will be with us, whom we will not cease to pray for his church, and it may be that, with the given councils reduced to ashes, and by the power of his spirit, we too will learn to handle the common affairs of the catholic church more cautiously and to understand more and more this saying of Christ: "Beware of men" [Mt 10, 17].</p>
      <p>If only we understood this more deeply: "The kingdom of God does not come with observation" [Lk 17, 20]. For Bucer is of the opinion, as the fathers once were - indeed, he imbibed this from the fathers, if I am not mistaken -, that ecclesiastical ceremonies are useful, and even so, that you do not see Christians more holy than those who have lived under the discipline of ceremonies, as if Christ had not chosen equally pious and wise ones for himself from the very world. Therefore, the question arises whether ceremonies are beneficial in the church, and my opinion is that they are not beneficial, indeed not mine, but of all the good among us, and we believe that you will go with the best of them in our opinion with hands and feet. If the opposite is asserted, many other questions will follow from this, especially which ceremonies are to be selected; hence, how much is to be attributed to these, also which are free, which are not free, and there will be no end to disputing about these until a new kingdom of appearances is born from the kingdom of Christ. We here, as many as we are, believe that the royal way of planting, establishing, promoting, and sustaining the kingdom of Christ is this: to preach the word of Christ and the holy gospel vigorously, purely, simply, and with great courage. For from this the hearts of men are reformed, while ceremonies make nothing but hypocrites. And that is one thing.</p>
      <p>As for the discipline of those who are not drawn by the word of the gospel, we believe that nothing is more relevant than to exhort the magistrate, that he may lend a hand and watch, lest the people be unbridled and live without discipline, and we deny again and again, even and again, that ceremonies are suitable for true and solid discipline or that true Christians can be born from the governance of ceremonies except such as you would rightly regret and whose hypocrisy would soon destroy the purity of our heart and faith. In my judgment, ceremonies give birth to notable hypocrites not subject to the righteousness of God, and then also the most pernicious enemies of the truth. And that is the second thing.</p>
      <p>Others meditate on a middle way, who are not led by the word in the heart nor by the authority of the magistrate according to the hardness of the flesh, but by the institution of ceremonies outside the royal way of God. But if we freely proceed on the path of grace and God's order and earnestly and truly press the word and command the unruly fleshly ones to the other order, such as the authority (government, state power), then it would follow that, as far as the order of the word is concerned, whoever would accept it would also be earnest about it, and good Christians would be given from the heart. Whoever did not like it would leave us; we would also let him go until he would gladly (yet) be of the word. If there were then much fleshly living, one would earnestly continue with praying and admonishing the authorities. If they took it up, it would be well and good, and one would have to thank God for it. If they did not take it up, then we would have done our part. Meanwhile, as long as they let us preach, there would be more and more truly Christian people. If it came to the point that they would not let us preach, then one would first truly feel who would be of the spirit of Christ. But some imagine a middle way through which one makes Christians and keeps the people in discipline, that is, through ceremonies, which, if anyone, even the most impious, observes, yet willingly or unwillingly boasts himself a Christian. But have such notable Christians been born from the discipline of ceremonies? O God, have not the most ferocious enemies emerged from this as if from a Trojan horse in troops? But enough about this. You would have had in fewer words what I want and what I think about the kingdom of ceremonies, plainly nothing else than what I think about hypocrisy, hostility, and much, much material for discord.</p>
      <p>I write nothing about the attempt and piety of the French. However, I agree with you in all things, and the main point is: Satan persecutes the church and the kingdom of Christ under the title of council and concord. Nor can I describe the character of each prince of this age, but that Roman pasquinade has done its duty, I send you its judgment and lots. The mysteries of the sentences are true and great.</p>
      <p>We have not heard a word about Ambrosius during this whole month.</p>
      <p>We have nothing reliable about the army gathered at Meran. From many, some have been chosen, others return with much indignation.</p>
      <p>Never cease to love Bucer, and as far as this cause of concord is concerned, you can excuse him, especially among those whose judgment is not entirely pure and who are accustomed to condemn a whole person from one lapse.</p>
      <p>Now farewell with the dearest women, mother and wife, and also the sweetest girls. May Christ keep you safe for us for a very long time. I wish Pellicanus, Theodor, Leon, Stainer, Utinger, and all the other brothers and companions to be very well.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>I beg you for God's sake, forgive my miserable writing. I would rather talk about it with you in the bath at Urdorf than write.</p>
