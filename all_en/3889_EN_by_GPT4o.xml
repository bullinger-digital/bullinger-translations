      <p>Our Lelius, an eyewitness of all that was done in the assemblies of the kingdom, has freed me from a long writing: if I were to write what he reports, I would be doing what has already been done and burdening you with unnecessary work. Regarding my own situation, I have nothing certain to write.</p>
      <p>The hope that keeps me here is as well known to Lelius as it is to me. Therefore, omitting these, I greet you reverently and pray to the best and greatest God for all happiness for you and all yours. If the Lord begins to act in the cause of religion, I will make sure that it becomes known to you.</p>
      <p>I know, my Bullinger, how much I owe you, I remember the services with which you have treated me both in absence and in presence; therefore, be assured that Lismanini is very much yours. My wife reverently greets you and your most holy wife and your most honorable daughters. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Pelsnica, March 10, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Lismanini in person</p>
      <p>To the most learned and of exceptional piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich, much respected lord and brother. In Zürich.</p>
