      <p>When I recently departed from you, you instructed me to visit you with my letters. Indeed, I would hardly have dared to undertake this, to address you, such an outstanding man, with frivolous and inept letters, if the matter itself and your excellent kindness had not prompted me, as you entrusted and most diligently recommended me to such a great man, by the immortal God, endowed with such a happy talent, such eloquence, and such knowledge of all languages and disciplines. Hence, I hope, with the help of the best and greatest God, to attain not a mediocre learning. For he applies such diligence in teaching that I cannot express it in words. I could recount many things to you about this, if literary matters, with which I am entangled on all sides, did not distract me. However, it will be mine to remember perpetually what I cannot express, and I will never forget you. But would that God grant me the ability someday to declare this most ardent spirit of mine towards you more by deeds than by words.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and always consider me as highly recommended to you.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel, in the year etc. 1533</p>
      <p>Your Melchior Wirz.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious man in both piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed patron.</p>
