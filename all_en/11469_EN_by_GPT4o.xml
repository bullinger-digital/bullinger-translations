    <p xml:id="regest1">As his eyes have recovered, he hastens to write on a somewhat delicate matter: Of the three [Zürich students], only Christoph [Rotacher] has remained with him, while [Konrad Suter and Christian Wirth] have left, citing reasons that are not very convincing; however, he does not want to cause them any trouble and has high hopes for Christoph. He is concerned about Bullinger's dizziness and recommends taking it easy. The situation is dire all around, concerning Emperor [Charles V] and Germany, King [Ferdinand I] and Hungary, the persecutions in France and England, [Duke Henry of] Brunswick, the arsonists, and the Seven Cantons. The only "pleasant" news: Wolfgang Wissenburg is to be promoted to doctor.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Now at last, by the grace of God, my eyes have been restored so that I can see a little.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I could not hold back my pen any longer, especially on a matter which, if I delayed further, I do not know in what way it might be taken.</p>
      <p>After half a year, of the three you sent to us, two have moved to another host; Christoph has remained. They have stated reasons that they cannot stay in this house: first, because they cannot study; second, because the table costs too much, so they cannot buy books; third, because nothing is read in public. Having refuted these, because I could not consider them just causes, I dismissed them gently with this voice: "I will not burden your cause with the people of Zürich; but if I perceive any deceit, I will not tolerate it." Christoph is a young man, as far as I have seen so far, very good, especially dutiful, for which reason he has been targeted by the others with mockery more than once. As far as I know, he neglects nothing. At home, he is engrossed in books. He does not leave the house unless he has asked for permission. If he remains here, I can indeed promise well of him. Master Grynaeus would have provided every effort if they had wanted to comply. But about this matter, more at another time.</p>
      <p>But enough about these things.</p>
      <p>I am certainly very sorry, as is fitting, about your prolonged dizziness. I do not doubt that reading, writing, and those deep and frequent thoughts are the cause.</p>
      <p>What then, if you were to moderate yourself here? You cannot become more learned, there is no need to seek greater praise, nor can you more successfully lead your church. Therefore, make sure to preserve yourself through moderate studies, as far as possible; for this will be the best and most useful for the church and for all of us.</p>
      <p>The rest is: We are surrounded by evils on all sides. The Emperor feigns concord throughout Germany. The King stirs up turmoil in Hungary. The French King permits persecution again. The English King rages, for he has condemned three good men to punishment in recent months without a stated cause. The Duke of Brunswick, acting in Rome through his agents, heavily oppresses Brunswick. Arsonists are behaving very badly. The Seven Cantons are contemplating war. The Diet of Worms is deceitfully sought by the adversaries. While these things are happening, who will escape evil, except those who belong to the Lord? Let us therefore be of the Lord.</p>
      <p>There is one thing, however, for which I rejoice: Next week we will create Master Wolfgang Wissenburg as Doctor of Theology. The creator will be Doctor Andreas Carolstadt.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family and, I beseech you, take care of your health diligently. Basel, 15th of October, year 40.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
