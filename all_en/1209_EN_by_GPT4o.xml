      <p>Greetings. Recently, when I was going to Neuch√¢tel, a messenger with your letters met me on the way. Later, when I returned home, an Italian offered me another set along with the fifth Decade. You excuse yourself for sending your books not so that I may learn from you, but just as I wish my own labors to benefit all the pious, so in turn I gladly profit from the writings of others. And this is truly fraternal communication, where we recognize that the gifts of the spirit are distributed among us in such a way that no one person is self-sufficient. Therefore, your gift was pleasing to me.</p>
      <p>The publication of our Consensus brought much joy, not only to me but also to Farel and the other brothers.</p>
      <p>If only your letters had arrived fifteen days earlier. For they would have been released at the Frankfurt fair. As for our France, the publication will be timely. Indeed, as I hope, it will be very useful.</p>
      <p>Recently, my commentaries on Isaiah and the canonical Epistles were printed. It seemed appropriate to dedicate both to the King of England.</p>
      <p>You could have read a copy of one preface, which I sent to Vergerio. I also added private letters, in which I tried to encourage the noble character of the boy. Meanwhile, sad news arrived that Hooper is being held in prison. I had feared this for some time. Now I fear that the bishops, as if victors, will become much more insolent. Therefore, just as I praise his constancy in refusing the anointing, I would have preferred (though I do not approve of it) that he did not fight so much over the cap and linen vestment: and I recently advised this. He has many and powerful adversaries: nor do I doubt that they are keen to oppress him. But I hope the Lord will be with him, and indeed all the more because, as I hear, some attack him treacherously, who otherwise pretend to favor the gospel.</p>
      <p>I congratulate you on the peaceful state of the church. Here there are most wicked scoundrels who cause us no small amount of trouble and disturbance: yet I trust that the outcome they deserve is imminent. The plans of the Emperor make many anxious.</p>
      <p>That some of his troops are now crossing the Alps is rightly suspicious. If he invades this region, I console myself with no other hope than that the Lord will rescue me from this miserable life.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, He will not neglect His flock, whose care especially torments me. Farewell, most distinguished man and fellow minister, much to be respected by me, along with the brothers, whom you will diligently greet in the name of us all. Gallasius also sends you his personal greetings.</p>
      <p>May the Lord continue to guide you with His spirit, protect you with His hand, and bless your holy labors! Geneva, March 12, 1551.</p>
