      <p>Holy Reverend Father in Christ, one movement always follows another.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, our bishop died. The day before, before I could send your book, he began to have a fever; grief was his downfall.</p>
      <p>Good God, how many waves again, how many storms do I foresee! Thus, I never free myself from misery. He died intestate and unexpectedly. The passing of the Bishop of Konstanz is awaited.</p>
      <p>There are strange practices in Switzerland; the papists promise themselves everything from the alliance. In Germany, the pope is attempting everything.</p>
      <p>I would have the Iliad if I were with you.</p>
      <p>April 29, in the year 1565.</p>
      <p>The return of the Spanish envoy is expected. I have arranged for the acts to be copied, and if any of our people depart, I will send them.</p>
