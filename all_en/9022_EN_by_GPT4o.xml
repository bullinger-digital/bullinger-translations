      <p>My friendly greetings with the offering of all honor, love, and goodness beforehand, especially gracious, dear sir, I have received your letter according to its date well, and I thank you very kindly with a request to continue in this manner. Today, Zeiger brings me this much mail from Bern; however, I send you primarily in 3 pieces, which you should have translated by someone knowledgeable in the French language, as I am unable, due to the matters in Baden that have occupied me, to translate them for you. And once that is done, please send the mentioned 3 pieces back to me at your convenience. May Almighty God grant us His grace and good spirit to pursue these matters and to proceed with them, so that His honor may be sanctified and preserved.</p>
      <p>May He grant you health and long life. From Baden in Aargau, 11th of September, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your always willing servant, Johann Steiger.</p>
