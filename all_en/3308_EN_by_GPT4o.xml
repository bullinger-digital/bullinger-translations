      <p>S. D. I read your book written against the Saxons with great eagerness, and while reading, I gave many thanks to God and to you, and I still give the greatest thanks; for I like the book. I do not wish to recite your praises to your face here; however, I know there will be those who wished the book had been written in a calmer spirit. Nevertheless, the more I am affected by the defense of our common cause, the more I am troubled, because I understand that you have placed all your hope and directed all your plans on Philipp. I acknowledge Philipp to be a good man, but a human and indeed a timid one, who, even if we meet and converse a hundred times, will never bring as much benefit to our churches as a colloquium not with Philipp, but rather with Brenz, Schnepf, and others will bring harm with their madness. The example terrifies me and experience has taught me; for while Bucer of blessed memory promised certain concord between Luther and our churches, relying not a little on Philipp's moderation, the matter did not succeed even after many labors endured, many expenses spent, and many colloquies held, so that we later had the Saxons as almost more hostile enemies, and finally, the peace of our churches was not a little disturbed, and many who had previously agreed beautifully were set against each other. Therefore, if you have promised a colloquium to Philipp, I indeed promise nothing of my own accord; for it is not within my ability or power. Such a matter pertains to the knowledge of the whole church, which I serve.</p>
      <p>Therefore, without the advice and deliberation of the brothers, without the advice and consent of the holy magistrate, and especially without the advice and conscience of neighboring and allied churches, I will promise nothing here. However, if I understand that a colloquium will be legitimate, and it has been presented to the magistrate and brothers of the church, I will conduct myself here, God willing, as I think it befits a faithful minister of Christ. And regarding the confession presented to the WÃ¼rttemberg and Palatinate princes, in which you see nothing contrary to our doctrine, I have incidentally pointed out some things that seem contrary: and I am still of the opinion that I do not acknowledge it in all respects. If we were to descend into a colloquium and the adversaries were to object it to us, and they wanted to aggravate us with it as a prejudice, I would clearly deny having anything to do with it. If it is not possible to more clearly and expediently express our opinion on the Lord's Supper in writings and bring it to the public, I would rather be condemned a thousand times by the presidents of the colloquium than to profess our faith so obscurely and with words so disputable in both directions, yet leaning more towards the adverse side, or to subscribe to others professing it. But I understand that the adversaries have conceived a hope, and indeed a very firm one, that when it comes to the colloquium, we will agree in such a form as they have received from those who have most solemnly protested that it is taught in all the Swiss churches in that manner, etc. There is no time (now) to write to brothers Farell and Beza about this matter.</p>
      <p>Would that there were no need for this, etc.</p>
      <p>We cannot do without the most distinguished man, Peter Martyr: therefore, ensure that the Italian brothers do not continue to trouble us with this matter. We love them and would sincerely wish to comply with them, unless what is asked is something we cannot provide. May all the brothers and fellow ministers be safe.</p>
      <p>You, most esteemed and dearest brother, love us in the Lord, who love you most dearly. Let us pray that we may be delivered from evil in these grave dangers.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, September 10, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, John Calvin, most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, most esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
