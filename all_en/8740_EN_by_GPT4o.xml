      <p>Greetings. At this very hour, as your Knöulius was about to depart, your letters sent to me through Küngßfeld were delivered. I am glad that the wine has been brought to you, and at the same time, I wish you a thousand prosperous and happy years. Steiger and Manuel do the same, with whom, as my fellow citizens, I spent the recent festival. The lord consul was concerned that it might arrive there too late or be spoiled on the journey, because the sailors were proceeding more slowly due to the low water levels. What you write about the affairs of France greatly troubles me, especially because we hear that some sort of preludes to new disturbances are being prepared. I have written to my brother about the rumors here concerning these matters; he will share them with you. If I learn anything more certain, I will likewise inform you. Let us pray to the Lord to avert these storms from the necks of His people and grant peace to the churches.</p>
      <p>Coladonius has not yet arrived here; I hope, however, that he will remain in his duty.</p>
      <p>What I wrote recently about forming an alliance between us, I may have written more boldly than is appropriate. If I have erred in this, I ask for your forgiveness; for I love you so much that I dare to pour out anything, however rashly, to you. These are indeed my thoughts, to conceal nothing: you have a marriageable daughter, whose virtues I need not extol here; my brother, however, has a daughter, and when I consider her circumstances and character, it seems to me that the marriage would not be unequal, provided it could be done with your and the girl's and the friends' consent. Although I am not unaware of how useful she is to you in your house and how reluctantly you would give her to another household, I also think it might be possible for you to take a son-in-law into your house without any loss or trouble, who could also be of great help to your studies. I am merely stating what I am thinking; nothing else has been entrusted to me, indeed, to say more, I also have a son nearly twenty years old, a scribe, who has made satisfactory progress in both French and German, whom I would still gladly send to France. If he were to complete his studies to the end he aims for, I would also dare to solicit you about such a matter, provided you would allow it and she would be willing to be a Bernese. He has shown himself to me so far to be of such character, form, and stature that, if it pleases the Lord and he continues as he has begun, I hope he will someday be useful to this republic. See how extensively I explain my thoughts to you. If they are perhaps not wisely considered by me, they are not thought with ill intent, but from one who loves you and yours and wishes well for all of you. As for my father-in-law, he has recovered again, but he is not yet using his strength fully; he is becoming more and more emaciated every day, so I fear we may not have him much longer. He greets you and wishes you a most prosperous year.</p>
      <p>His wife, my mother-in-law, is still bedridden with some uncertain illness; however, we still have good hope that she will recover soon. May the Lord grant this!</p>
      <p>Steiger is not called noble, but is commonly written to as "To the pious, honorable mayor of the city of Bern and lord of Roll," etc. I have nothing else now, except to pray to the Lord to strengthen your health more and more, so that we may enjoy your comfort for many more years. Amen.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 3, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
