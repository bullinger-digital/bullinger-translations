      <p>I returned yesterday from Strasbourg, from where I wrote to you. Upon returning here, I found the following news: The servant, whom I had when I was in Zürich, sent to me by Gribaldi himself, stole many things from my house, nearly 30 florins, and fled; but he was caught in Böblingen, leaving behind the stolen goods, yet he was still able to escape. I hope to recover everything, for I know they are safe. But since I suspect he took my seal with him, for I have not found it yet, warn the Cremonese, warn Ziegler, especially warn Mr. Bassafontaneus, not to be deceived nor to trust the seal if they do not see my handwriting throughout the entire letter. I have written to Italy, so that in the future they may see whom they are recommending to me.</p>
      <p>Now I have nothing else to write. Farewell and greetings to all. Pray for me. Tübingen, August 2, 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>[To the] most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, honorable brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
