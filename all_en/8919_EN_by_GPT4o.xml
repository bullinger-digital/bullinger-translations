      <p>God with us. Dearly beloved son, we are all doing quite well; may God also grant you health and good times. Here we have all sorts of unrest from some unruly people, who are spreading all kinds of rumors, and some have been placed in the Wellenberg to be questioned and to get to the bottom of it; for our lords are seriously intent on finding out where such rumors are coming from, as if one wanted to hold mass here, as you have undoubtedly heard about etc. It is quite a bad matter; may God make it all good.</p>
      <p>The conclave of cardinals has elected a pope, called Boncompagni, cardinal of Bologna. However, the cardinal of Florence and the French are protesting against him and the election, because they claim it is premature and they could not attend. I wish they would tear each other apart. And just as the king in France has given some cities to the evangelicals out of mistrust, so now the evangelicals have returned them to the king; for they do not want to maintain any mistrust against the king, but rather submit to him in all things in loyalty etc. The king has received this with the highest thanks and told them they must see that he will protect them faithfully.</p>
      <p>Thereupon he has summoned the powerful and rulers in France and sworn them to provide good protection, justice, and rights to the evangelicals etc. Praise be to God in eternity. The synod in Nîmes is said to be in session and they are all in agreement; may God grant that it remains so. In the Netherlands, the war is said to be starting strongly, and Alba is in such armor and power that it is to be feared (unless God works wonders) that the seafarers will hardly be able to resist him without stronger support. May God also make that good. Other news is not available; I can no longer write, I am very tired and dispirited. Poor Hans Rudolf Bygel in Kappel has been placed in the hole, as he has lost his senses, which grieves me greatly etc. Patrisare is feared. This letter is soon to be sent to Schaffhausen by Batt Löwen, asking him to make a ride here on account of his sister-in-law and to notify the other brothers-in-law or me 8 days in advance etc. Greet Susanna and the children for us. All our people greet you, and send me back the kisses sometime by Dyessen. June 6, 1572.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
      <p>Appointed pastors: Zindel from Zurzach to Kappel. Kerez from the Rhine Valley to Altstetten. Boshart from Turgi to Hasli, Widler from Gäs to Kyburg.</p>
