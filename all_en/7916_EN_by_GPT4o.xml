      <p>Greetings. As much sorrow as I received from your illness, I now take as much joy from your recovery, although it is still somewhat suspect to me until I see your hand. In the meantime, I would have written to you more frequently; but I do not know by what reason it happens that so few now come to me who are traveling to you.</p>
      <p>Even if I had many, I could never have written anything certain; for rumors vary so much that what is said for certain today is soon found not only uncertain but also vain. Now it is commonly reported that the Count Palatine in France has died of illness and that the plague is raging fiercely in both armies. Others speak of a new conflict in which Granviller was killed by a cannonball and the Count Palatine was victorious; yet no one believes it. They also say that Alba is being recalled to Spain because of the uprisings there, so that he may stain himself with more blood there as well. The governance of the Netherlands is said to have been entrusted to the Cardinal of Arles. Various but uncertain things are reported about the English.</p>
      <p>It is affirmed for certain that Mr. Viret, along with some others, was unexpectedly buried in a certain castle belonging to the Queen of Navarre, captured, taken to Toulouse, and there burned; others say he was first beheaded by the sword. Thus these bloodsuckers do not cease to act, while in the meantime they pretend to offer hope of some peace. Who would trust these treacherous scoundrels? May they perish with their peace!</p>
      <p>With us, the Savoyard and Genevan envoys have been here almost the entire month. Many attempts have been made to establish peace between them; but all in vain. The prince does not want to relinquish any of his rights, which he seems to have over them; they, however, do not want to concede anything, not even the slightest, but wish to remain in that freedom in all respects, which they have enjoyed since his father was expelled. Meanwhile, the prince seeks to renew the old alliance with us. This was initially denied to him until he settled matters with the Genevans; finally, at the request of the Genevans as well, it came to the point that the terms of the alliance were established by us, under which the Genevans could have peace. Among these was that the Genevans remain in their present freedom and the prince neither acts against them by force nor by right within twenty-five years, but the alliance should last only twenty years, and the Genevans should grant the prince, if he requests, passage and lodging with his court, yet not bring any armed soldier with him. Neither the prince nor the Genevans wanted to accept these terms, and thus, after many expenses and efforts, the first departure from here was yesterday, with no other day for a meeting having been set.</p>
      <p>You have the summary of the actions. I have nothing else now, except that I pray you greet all yours in my name.</p>
      <p>Mine also greet you, my wife, father-in-law, both consuls, and the treasurer. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 6, 1569.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
