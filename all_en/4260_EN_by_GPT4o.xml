      <p>Illustrious, high-born prince, your princely grace, my humble, dutiful, and ready service at all times beforehand. Gracious prince and lord, this past winter, with God's help, I have written six books on all the sects of the Anabaptists, also on and about their teachings and opinions. I am sending your princely grace herewith a copy of these books with a most friendly and deserving intention, not because your princely grace needs it, but solely so that your princely grace may see that we in the churches of the Confederation have no commonality with the Anabaptists or other sects, but that we hold the Christian and true faith concerning the holy faith, the church, the holy sacraments, and the authorities, as well as proper governance, even though in some prominent people's writings we are counted among the Anabaptists and accused as sectarians, etc.</p>
      <p>We humbly ask that your princely grace may graciously accept this book from me, your willing servant, consider this my writing well, and always graciously keep it in your princely grace. For if I could serve your princely grace, I would always be willing and faithful. May God Almighty graciously preserve your princely grace in His divine grace for eternity.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, the 6th of April, 1560. Your princely grace's willing servant Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church in Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious, high-born prince and lord, Lord Friedrich, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Duke in Upper and Lower Bavaria, Arch-Steward and Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, my most gracious prince and lord.</p>
