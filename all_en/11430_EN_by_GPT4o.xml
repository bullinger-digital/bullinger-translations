From Strasbourg, it is heard that the friendship between the Emperor and [King Francis I] has cooled, so there is currently nothing to fear from the Emperor. Oporin and Grynaeus have been suspended from their teaching positions because they refuse academic degrees, and Karlstadt would have expected even harsher measures; the people of Strasbourg are exerting great pressure, and [Myconius and Grynaeus] can only maintain their position with God's help.

      <p>Greetings. I have recommended the person you sent to Oporin; if he has accepted him, you will understand from the person present.</p>
      <p>Regarding the imperial matters, I can currently write only this: The priests are taking great care to prevent a council or assembly of princes from being convened, as they are very fearful and guilty, but they want the matter to be resolved by the doctors, whom Murner specifically designated in the Baden disputation, namely with lances and swords, etc. Furthermore, the six-month truce with the Turk will end in no more than eight weeks. What will happen then is awaited.</p>
      <p>The Emperor has sent two counts (no priest) to the evangelical princes and cities, but what they have in their mandates is not yet known. Bucer is expected daily; he will tell everything. These are from a nobleman who came here directly from the Emperor, a citizen of this city.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it is written from Strasbourg that the warmth of friendship between the Emperor and the French has cooled, which the adversaries boasted so much about; therefore, there is nothing to fear from the Emperor this year, after he has been deprived of the support he had greatly hoped for. The same nobleman said this about the French, and after he got closer to Lower Germany and saw what had been done, he returned. In summary, the Emperor attempted things that did not succeed.</p>
      <p>About us, hear complaints again: Oporin has been deprived of the Greek lecture and the prepositure because he did not want to become a master, etc., Mr. Grynaeus similarly of the theological lecture. Karlstadt is surprised that he was not also expelled from the city because he rejected the magistrate's request to become a doctor. "If I," he said, "had acted like this, I would have been expelled from the city." This to you and Theodor. No one insists more seriously and annoyingly on accepting the doctorate than the people of Strasbourg, and they press the good man so much that they almost oppress him. They call him an Anabaptist because he refuses the title, and in this contention, they have renounced friendship. This again to you. With these few words, I wanted to greet you again. If the Lord had not lent a hand, we would have fallen long ago, and now we could not help but fall. There are those who swear that everything tends to ruin the two of us. May the Lord help us, which we hope for. Farewell with yours in the Lord. Greet Theodor and Pellican, and ask them to let me know whether they laughed or cried over our theological exercises.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, April 23, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, lord and brother in Christ. Zurich.</p>
