      <p>Greetings. Lord Nikolaus von Diesbach and Lord Emanuel have set out for Baden. Diesbach will share with you any news.</p>
      <p>He was very pleased with your recent letters; I believe they were also read in the council. He shared them with me as well.</p>
      <p>Nothing was accomplished in Meudon because the arbitrator from Schwyz did not appear. We had heard that the Five Cantons were going to send another delegation to the Valais, and our people had warned the Valaisans about it; but in the meantime, I have not heard that they sent anyone. Perhaps we will learn something from Baden.</p>
      <p>I still do not know whether our people will send a delegation to Hermance or not.</p>
      <p>I learned indirectly through a relative, who is of the senatorial order in Lucerne, that the Five Cantons have confirmed an alliance with the Prince of Savoy; under what conditions, I do not know. Thus, the wretched ones leave nothing undone that they think can be done to harm us; but I hope God will humble them someday. Our people will negotiate with the Duke of Savoy eight days after Martinmas in Neuchâtel.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant that the outcome of affairs be favorable and that everything succeeds happily! We have learned nothing certain from France for a long time now.</p>
      <p>Regarding your students, whom you have recalled and who are delivering this, namely Schwytzer and Abbenceller, they have conducted themselves well here, so that we can give them a good testimony of piety, modesty, and diligence, and we ask that they be commended to you. I hope you have received Musculus's "Loci."</p>
      <p>He sends his greetings to you; the same do the treasurers, my father-in-law, Zehender, and Fellenberger. Greet your entire household in my name.</p>
      <p>My mother has returned to us safe and sound by the grace of the Lord, and she also sends her greetings to you and all yours. Bern, September 11, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your forever, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, my honorable lord and most beloved compatriot.</p>
