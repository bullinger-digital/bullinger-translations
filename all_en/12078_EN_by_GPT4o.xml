    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommends the young, pious bearer [Gerhard thom Camph]. The scandal provoked by Luther's writing ["Kurtz bekentnis"] will grow if [the Zurichers] do not defend themselves against the accusation that they supposedly recognize only empty symbols of the absent Christ in the Lord's Supper and do not enjoy a true and real presence; with full right, many churches think and say with the words of the Lord that the eating of the bread is also the eating of the body of the Lord, while they deny that this is in any way in contradiction with the nature of the true body in Christ or with his heavenly glory; some adhere strictly to the word of God and are content with its obscurity without further explanation; others tolerate explanations, insofar as the offering and reception of the true body of the Lord is always affirmed as before. Driven by his character, Luther is not only content with the obscurity of Christ's words, but he emphasizes (albeit only in the heat of the moment) these words in such a stark manner to make it clear that they are not mere symbols; fundamentally, he wants to say nothing other than that with bread and wine, in some way, but true and real, the true body of Christ is received, albeit in such a way that the one body of Christ is not torn apart to different places or his heavenly glory diminished; Luther's inconvenient writing is more attributable to his whisperers than to himself; his strictness is due to his zeal for God's word; may [the Confederates] not appear as slanderers; [Luther] is only concerned that the symbols are not portrayed as empty; this is already evident from his letter [of December 1, 1537] to the [Confederates]; if only they had learned something from the [First Helvetic] Confession and adhered to it! Particularly disturbing is this certainly unworthy dogma of the salvation of idolaters by Zwingli for Christian scholars. This wound inflicted on the churches by Luther's writing [where this dogma is denounced] is too deep to be healed soon and without leaving a scar. Bullinger should understand that Bucer is seeking ways to remove the scandal from the world, if at all possible; nothing is more important than the edification of the church; Bucer wishes that [the Zurichers] are not accused of a view of the Lord's Supper that contradicts the word of God and do not appear as slanderers of well-written or defensible writings of others; Bullinger should forgive him his verbose admonitions, which he could also give to him in return. Again asks for the printed part of Gessner's "Bibliotheca universalis." [The Zurichers] should pray for the Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied], for the Cologne clergy, more incensed against their bishop by the proximity and victory of the Emperor [Charles V], have publicly renounced him and set a negotiation date for the provincial order. [After the signature:] Bucer asks [the Zurichers] not to form an opinion about all of Germany solely from the judgment of Luther's opponents; most churches do not share this view; however, it is true that there are very few scholars who do not also wish that [the Zurichers] behave correctly and that Luther acts more mildly towards [them].</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>We commend this exceptionally pious young man to the love of all of you; he is born of good and pious parents, adorned with a religious spirit and morals, and diligently applies himself to pious and useful studies.</p>
      <p>In the common cause of the churches, may the Lord grant that the scandal given by Luther's writing is not increased! This will certainly happen if you do not diligently defend yourselves against the accusation that you recognize only empty symbols of the absent Christ in the sacred supper and do not acknowledge any true and real presence and enjoyment of Christ. For many churches, with the words of the Lord, rightly believe and say that the bread we break is not only bread but also the eating of the Lord's body, because it is a communion in eating; they willingly deny that this mode is in any way contrary to the nature of the true body in Christ or to his heavenly glory. Some wish, lest they be led away from the word of God by their own reasoning, to remain in the obscurity of God's word without any inquiry into this mode; others indeed endure some explanation of the mode, but in such a way that they clearly and fully confess beforehand and always that the true body of the Lord is given and received through the sacred symbols. Luther, because of his character, tends to retreat to the other extreme as much as he can in contention, is not content to involve himself in the obscurity of Christ's word, but also expresses this as crudely as he can (only in contention), to fully express that for which he contends, that the symbols of Christ are not empty here. However, it is certain that he wishes to assert nothing more than that with the bread and wine, in some way, but truly and really, the true body of the Lord is given and received, in such a way, however, that the body of the Lord is neither divided into places nor stripped of its heavenly glory. Would that you would attribute the importunity of writing against you more to his unjust whisperers, to whom we owe it entirely, than to Luther himself! Then, that he exceeds the measure of severity too much, ascribe to his zeal for the sincerity of the divine word, not to malice, not to pride. It will indeed be necessary, unless you wish to incur the crime of slander among countless churches. Do not attribute to him beyond these things: that the symbols in the sacred supper are not empty, but that the body and blood of the Lord are given and received in them or with them or through them - which by nature are always something else; for it is fitting for you to remember what he wrote to you with his own hand about the simplicity of his opinion, and then also explained publicly. Would that you would publish the Basel Confession for the greater purification of your churches and testify that you stand by it!</p>
      <p>That doctrine, certainly unworthy of Christian teachers, about the salvation of idolaters, as Zwingli's words are so clearly written, torments me miserably. This wound inflicted on the churches by Luther's writing is deeper, alas, than it can be healed either quickly or without a disfiguring scar.</p>
      <p>Therefore, forgive me, as I anxiously search for and try to show ways to remove such a great and widespread scandal in such an unjust time, ways indeed to that which can scarcely be achieved by any, if indeed by any humans. Certainly, nothing should be more of our concern than the edification of the church of Christ; therefore, nothing should grieve us equally, and thus nothing else should we all strive so much to remove as these so harmful wounds of the church of God. I love and honor you sincerely in the Lord; therefore, I greatly wish you to be kept free from the crime and from a view of the Eucharist inconsistent with the word of God and from the writings of others, whether well or excusably written, being slandered. Then I also earnestly desire that you appear free from all desire to avenge yourselves or even to vindicate your own too much. Through Christ, I ask you to forgive me for admonishing you with so many words; for you will indeed do me a great favor if you also do this in return for me.</p>
      <p>What I recently wrote about the printed part of Gessner's Library, I ask and beg you again and again to take it to heart.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently and pray diligently for Cologne. For now, the Cologne clergy have publicly denied him as their bishop, have set a day for the provincial orders to approve this to them and to incite them fiercely against the bishop because of the nearby and victorious emperor. The Lord will restrain them, amen. He still stands firm with Christ. Strasbourg, November 8, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your entirely in the Lord, M. Bucer.</p>
      <p>I earnestly ask you in the Lord not to judge the opinion of all of Germany in this matter from those who continually applaud you against the Lutherans. Believe me, from experience, many thousands of churches feel differently; however, it is true that there are very few among the more learned, and those with a more sincere spirit, who do not also wish you to be well and Luther to act more mildly towards you.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zurich, his greatly esteemed and dearest friend in the Lord.</p>
