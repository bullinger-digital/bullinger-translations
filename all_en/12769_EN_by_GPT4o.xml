    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Duke Ulrich of Württemberg retreated to Hohentwiel with 200 [horsemen] last Tuesday [December 21]. The Imperial forces are in his land and have taken, among other places, Weinsberg. The entire land is shocked by the Duke's flight, although it is probably better that he has withdrawn. He had, after all, furloughed the majority of his troops eight days ago and manned the fortresses of Schorndorf and [Hohen]asperg with only a few companies of foreign mercenaries.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Some councilors of Konstanz believe that the Confederates should send a friendly letter to the Duke or write to Emperor [Charles V.] and make it clear to him that they do not intend to passively watch the downfall of Württemberg, their granary. At the very least, the people of Zurich should take the initiative by inquiring about the situation with the Duke.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] There is much to report, but Blarer can only write until the council messenger departing for Zurich [...] arrives.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Some believe that the [Imperial invasion of Württemberg] is aimed at the [southern German Imperial] cities and the Confederates. May the Lord grant his protection!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] According to a report from an Augsburg resident [...] (who brought his wife and children to safety in Konstanz), [Nicolas Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle's marriage plan [between Charles V. and Margaret of France] has piqued the interest of [Francis I.]. However, a traveler [...] from Bourges reports that the King did not want to receive Granvelle and instead sent word that he does not trust his master, the Emperor, as he has never kept to agreements. Incidentally, the King is said to have issued a mandate stating that no one should be persecuted for their faith anymore. Has Bullinger heard anything about this?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Ulm is negotiating peace with the Emperor. This greatly displeases the other cities. Despondency is increasing. The endangered cities of Esslingen and Reutlingen will likely want to negotiate an honest peace given their hopeless situation, but it will not be kept.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Count Georg of Württemberg, the young Margrave [Bernhard] of Baden-[Durlach], and Balthasar of Gültlingen were in the Imperial camp on Duke Ulrich's orders. Upon their return, they were accompanied by an Imperial herald [Hans Reichwein] (the Emperor himself is said to be not in the camp but in the Netherlands). What the delegation achieved, Blarer does not know. The Duke made the Imperial herald wait several days and only received him on December 19 in Balingen on the way to Hohentwiel. Afterward, he is said to have been very upset and sent the herald away. They probably did not agree on the terms of peace. It would be good if the Confederates (if they wanted to) would now militarily occupy the Hegau, especially since it would have dire consequences for the Confederates if the Emperor were to take the area or set up his winter camp there. How would one then get to the grain, of which there is still so much in the land? God have mercy! Blarer still hopes that God will show himself when it comes to the worst.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Bullinger should deliver the enclosed letter, the small chest, and the money from Augsburg to Hans Schöner or direct the council messenger to him. The messenger could not take one of the chests.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Denmark and the Hanseatic cities are said to be moving against Duke Maurice [of Saxony].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Bullinger should do his best to make it clear to the Confederates what they should do. The situation is critical! Regarding the delegation [from Lucerne and Freiburg to Francis I.], Blarer is confident. A diet should now be convened and the Duke encouraged with a letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Blarer must break off. He does not want to delay the messenger any longer. He had intended to send his own messenger before he learned of the dispatch of this council messenger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Bullinger should pray for the people of Konstanz, who will do the same for him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] [Enclosure:] [Johannes] Brenz to Bucer, Schwäbisch Hall, December 13, 1546:</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Brenz recently gave a letter for Bucer to a Frenchman [...], a citizen of Strasbourg. Just as [in August] the arrival [of Landgrave Philip of Hesse and Elector John Frederick of Saxony] was terrifying for the Papists, so now the departure of the princes is shameful for those left behind. They have no choice but to mourn and endure the mockery of their neighbors. Yet even though Christians are repeatedly oppressed by the world, Christ will ultimately triumph! The Emperor has taken Schwäbisch Hall into grace. However, the preservation of the city's privileges and its religion was not discussed. This is to be addressed later! At least the city has not yet been imposed with a governor or sent an Imperial deputy. [Maximilian of Egmont], Count of Buren, has set out with his army towards Frankfurt, the Emperor towards Heilbronn and Württemberg. From where shall help now come? Meanwhile, Brenz must continue to perform his duties, namely to call for piety and prayer. God will not abandon his people! Bucer and his colleagues should pray for Schwäbisch Hall.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] [P.S. from Blarer:] Since the [council] messenger has not yet arrived and a letter from Bucer with an attached letter from Brenz has arrived, Blarer encloses a copy of it.</p>

      <p>Friendly, beloved lord and brother, I write in great haste that Duke Ulrich of Württemberg retreated to Hohentwiel with 200 horsemen last Tuesday night, and the Imperial forces are in his land. They have taken Weinsberg and a bit more. The entire land is shocked, especially since the lord is away, although it might be good that he is at Hohentwiel. He had his troops, which he had gathered, return home eight days ago. He still has some, but few companies of foreign mercenaries and some fortresses, namely Schorndorf, Asperg, and others, manned.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I could not withhold this from you in haste, as some trusted people of my lords think that nothing better could be done now than if you and others, the common Confederates, could write to Duke Ulrich at Hohentwiel and show goodwill towards him, or that they should write earnestly to the Emperor, saying they cannot let this land be ruined, as it is their granary, etc., as the truth and the common Confederates have much at stake, or that at least those from Zurich should write to the Duke, so that there would be guidance in the matter and one could proceed.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I have much to write to you. I wait every moment for the messenger to depart, whom my lords want to send to yours. I will write as long as he does not come.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Some believe that the matter concerns all the cities and Confederates, but it is not good to write about it. Oh, Lord God, help, counsel, and be our best protection and shield here and there!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Someone from Augsburg told me (he brought his wife and child here for safety) that it was credibly written to him that Granvelle had arranged his affairs well with the French and that the marriage was proceeding: This should be certain and true. On the other hand, someone from Bourges was here these days. He says for sure that the king never wanted to receive Granvelle personally, but told him that his lord (the Emperor) never kept anything with him, with many other similar words. Also, the king, he says for the truth, has issued a mandate everywhere that no one should be killed for their faith anymore. If you know anything about it, let us also know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Ulm is in negotiations for peace with the Emperor, which greatly displeases the other cities, although it is still in the making. But it breaks out more and more, and others also become despondent. Esslingen is also in great danger and Reutlingen. And since they see that they are too weak for the Emperor and have no recourse, they will probably also seek an honest peace, which, however, will not be kept.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Count Georg of Württemberg and the young Margrave of Baden with Balthasar of Gültlingen have been in the Emperor's camp on Duke Ulrich's behalf. And when they returned, the Emperor's herald came with them (the Emperor is not with this army that is in Württemberg; it is said he is in the Netherlands). But what they have achieved, I could not be told exactly, only that the herald was detained for several days. The Duke did not want to let him in until now, when he rode up to Hohentwiel, as the Duke stayed overnight next to Balingen last Sunday. The herald was dispatched, and the Duke was very dissatisfied, so it is thought that peace was broken because of the conditions. Then he rode away. It would be good to make a move in Hegau now, if the Confederates also wanted to, as it would truly be of no small concern to them if they were to lose this land and the Emperor had his winter camp there. God help! How will we have a grain market? There is still an abundance of grain in the land! The truth, dear God have mercy on us! I still hope, when it comes to the crunch, God will show himself.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Deliver the enclosed letter, small chest, and money to Hans Schöner of Augsburg or direct the messenger to him. There is still a chest. He could not carry it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Otherwise, it is written that Denmark and the Hanseatic cities are strongly against Duke Maurice.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Be as diligent as you can, so that the Confederates see what they have to do. For truly, everything is critical. Regarding the embassy you wrote to me about, which was dispatched in the name of the two places, I am of good hope that they should consider and measure the matters rightly. It would be worth a day, and that Duke Ulrich would be written to in a friendly manner, so that he gains a heart.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>I can write no more. Take care. I wanted to send you my own messenger. But when I learned that my lords wanted to send this one, I saved the cost. I must not delay him any longer.</p>

      <p>God be with you. Praying earnestly, earnestly for us. We do the same. Dated, December 23, 1546, at one o'clock. A[mbrosius] Bl[arer].</p>

      <p>Brentius thus to Bucer:</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I wrote to you a few days ago, which letter I gave to a certain Frenchman, a citizen of your city, and I think you have now received it. Just as the arrival of our princes was terrifying to the Papists, so now their departure is shameful and disgraceful. We, having been deserted, have nothing left but groans, tears, and miseries. We have become a reproach to our neighbors. Those who drink wine sing against us. But it is well! "In the world you will have tribulation; but I have overcome the world." The Emperor has received Schwäbisch Hall into grace. Concerning the preservation of privileges and religion, not a word. All these things are postponed to another time. However, no garrison has yet been imposed on the city, nor has an Imperial deputy been sent here. The Count of Buren is setting out with his army to Frankfurt, while Charles is heading to Heilbronn and Württemberg. What then shall we say? Where shall we turn? "As the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters," etc. "From where will our help come?" Let us therefore do our duty! Let us continue to teach piety and pray to God! "For the Lord will not reject his people," even if he seems to show himself harsh now. And he will give an outcome that we can bear! I commend us and our very afflicted church to your prayers and those of your colleagues and your church. Farewell well and happily. From Schwäbisch Hall, December 13. Yours, Johannes Brenz.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Since the messenger has not yet been dispatched and a letter from Bucer has been brought to me, to which Brenz's letter to him is attached, it seemed right to also give you a copy of it.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
