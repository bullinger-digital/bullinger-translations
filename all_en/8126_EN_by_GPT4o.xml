      <p>S. D. Your sorrow is my sorrow. From my own grief, which I have experienced in the last two or three months, I gather what your state of mind must have been, as you understand these evils more than I do and seem to be more closely affected by them. Therefore, I am very grateful to you for writing to me to alleviate my sadness. Although the end of these troubles is not yet in sight, I consider it a great blessing from God to have some relief in these matters and to celebrate God's mercy that we are not consumed, as our enemies boasted a little while ago. Therefore, I urge you, as a prudent and pious man, to continue what you are doing, to moderate your grief, to rest in the admirable providence and saving will of our heavenly Father, and not to exhaust yourself with sorrow, which I do not doubt is greatest in the best of us during these times.</p>
      <p>You do not know what will follow and what use you and other good people might have in illuminating God's glory. The kingdom of Christ does not fall when the kingdoms of the world do. For that King reigns in the midst of His enemies, and His strength is made perfect in weakness. But I should not say more to you about these things, as they are better known to you than to me.</p>
      <p>I do not yet know when and where the imperial diet will be held. However, it is said to be held on the Rhine. There is already an imperial envoy here who is perhaps dealing with these and other matters. The wedding of Duke Johann Casimir is to take place after Easter, for which equestrian games are already being prepared.</p>
      <p>I hope the controversy stirred up here will be resolved in the way I was trying to lead it, namely, that it is agreed that open blasphemers should not be considered members of the church, and that disputes about other circumstances should be omitted. For those who argued against it now say they did not mean that those who deny repentance should be recognized as members of the church more than those who deny the faith; they only disputed about the manner and some unknown synod. As long as things go this way, I will easily allow them to interpret their words as best as possible. Therefore, as far as doctrine is concerned, the truth still prevails: As for execution, I expect nothing. Even the one to whom I told you I would write about this matter responded to me at length.</p>
      <p>He is indeed compelled to admit that blasphemers should not be confused with the church. But he tries to evade their exclusion, mainly by arguing that even the approach of the wicked to the sacraments is a profession of repentance and therefore no further inquiry should be made into them.</p>
      <p>What this means, you will consider: I certainly could not read it without great pain.</p>
      <p>I have not yet replied. But I am thinking of replying and showing why his arguments do not satisfy me, yet lovingly and modestly. And afterwards, I will cease to dispute with him as well as with others. For I withdraw myself as much as possible from the handling of these controversies and all public actions, not only out of hatred and weariness of these matters but also compelled by a lack of time, which is not even sufficient for my own duties.</p>
      <p>You recommended me to Mr. Ramus (Ramus from Candor). But I fear he suspects me to be the darkest, although I wish him well, even if I could not gratify him in all the ways he would have liked. He wanted to teach publicly here, much to the dismay of the professors and counselors. He pretended not to want to. If he had said a word to me, I would have freely and faithfully advised him on how he might have avoided his and others' annoyance. Meanwhile, he ran to those who pursued this matter with great contention before the prince, although they least understand scholastic and philosophical matters. The votes of young people, especially the French, were gathered, in whose name a petition was offered to the prince requesting that Mr. Ramus be allowed to lecture publicly. Orders were sent about this matter to the university, which for just reasons denied being able to grant Mr. Ramus the professorship. Therefore, when this did not succeed, a mandate was extorted from the absent prince to me, ordering that Mr. Ramus should teach in our college.</p>
      <p>This greatly disturbed me, as I saw how it would be odious to me both with the prince and with Mr. Ramus. For many reasons, I could not but oppose it, partly because there were many things that would not allow our school to be made public, especially Mr. Ramus, whom I did not doubt would have a more frequent audience than our place could accommodate, partly because it would be easier for me to yield than to deny another in my presence in my school what I affirmed, to affirm what I denied, to introduce new things which I had hitherto strived to keep out, to eject and expel old things which I had with much time and effort barely instilled and tried to transfer to some use. Therefore, it finally came to the university, ordered that a public auditorium be granted to him, but on the condition that he should read nothing without the consent of the prince nor anything about which there was no agreement between him and our schools. He read a speech for Marcellus, at first with some attendance of young people, then with almost only the French and some Belgians listening. At the end of this lecture, he said he would begin his dialectic (which he had previously recommended on occasion) the next day. There the university approached the prince, explained the reasons, and earnestly requested that it be allowed to prohibit this with his consent, as it was not at all consistent with the conditions under which the prince wanted him to read. It was granted, the auditorium was closed. It pains me that he preferred to become a laughingstock and disturb himself and others rather than, if he was indeed seeking a lodging or rather a place of residence here, to live in peace with grace and authority or even, if he so greatly desired to read, to proceed in another way about which I could have easily advised him. I incurred ill will with those who pursued his cause, induced by this reason alone, because he had written a treatise in favor of church discipline and therefore they thought they had found a suitable advocate and patron for that cause.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, although I saw this, I could not dissent from the professors in this matter, and that for many reasons which were inherent both in the matter itself and in the manner in which it was conducted.</p>
      <p>Then serious slanders were spread that we opposed Mr. Ramus out of hatred for the discipline, which we knew he favored, and because we could not bear those more learned than us, from both of which accusations I know those professors who most opposed him are most alien. For I should not say anything about myself here to you. Would that we had many patrons of discipline and those more learned than us, not only for the sake of our youth but also our own teachers. It was said to my face that there were factious men in the university whom I would support and encourage. And this from those who pursued this cause and alone want to be seen as patrons of discipline.</p>
      <p>Even some scholastic supporters affixed and spread malicious verses against the professors several times.</p>
      <p>Old wounds of the mind were not a little reopened and increased by this action, and new distractions were also made which will not easily be removed. This grieves me greatly, among many other inconveniences. But perhaps there is some good in this, that the minds and pursuits of some have been revealed, from whom the good and moderate will more easily guard themselves in the future. I wanted you to know these things as they happened, not so much so that nothing false about your friends is imposed on you as true, but so that you might encourage Mr. Ramus not to undertake anything of this kind in the future, for he would neither be consulting for himself nor for us, but would only stir up new disturbances. He wanted to confer with me about his dialectic. In other matters, although it was difficult for me, I nevertheless gave him several days, but I did not want to neglect my duties for this less necessary matter, nor did I wish to descend into an endless dispute with him, especially since I saw that he had long since decided what he wanted to think and could...</p>
