    <p xml:id="regest1">Shortly after Bullinger's letter of October 13, Heinrich Falkner also wrote and complained about the price of the cloth; he encloses his response to Falkner and asks Bullinger to translate it for him, as Hilles' German is even worse than his Latin. If Falkner returns the cloth to Bullinger, he should keep it until the arrival of John Burcher, as he does not want to sell it cheaper; especially in these warlike times, he could probably earn money more easily than with the cloth trade, but he thinks of the fate of the rich described in 1 Timothy 6 [17]. He mentioned the four guilders transmitted through Falkner [in No. 1790] because he had also sent a letter from Francis Warner, who lives in Hilles' house [No. 1761] - this describes some godless statutes that the [English] Parliament has enacted - and wanted to ensure its delivery. His wife [Anna Hilles], who gave birth to their son Gerson on the 2nd [of November], sends greetings and thanks for the prayers. He expects news from England. Since Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] already has many children, his wife wishes Frau Megander [Regula, née Offenhuser] the blessing of children.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace from Christ, our hope! Know, most esteemed sir, that, as you indicated in your letter dated October 13, Heinrich Falkner wrote to me shortly thereafter, complaining about the price of my cloth. I am sending you my response to Falkner, enclosed here, and I pray that you will kindly interpret it for him at your earliest convenience. In doing so, you will greatly oblige me. As you know, I do not know how to write sufficiently in Latin, and even less so in German; I have not yet mastered the phrasing of your language. But I must come to my point.</p>
      <p>If Mr. Falkner (after you have explained my intentions to him from my letters, or have had them explained by someone else) returns my cloth to you, I beg you, my dear sir, to receive and keep it in your house until the arrival of Johannes Burcher, to whom I will write about my intentions regarding that cloth and what he should do with it. In good faith, I cannot sell it at a lower price (given the current state of affairs) than I offered to Falkner. If I were solely focused on profit, I could have earned more from a thousand florins invested in other goods (especially in these times of war) than from two thousand florins spent on cloth. However, I always keep in mind what the apostle says in 1 Timothy 6 about those who wish to be rich in this world. Regarding the four florins I sent you through Falkner from the Strasbourg fair, I was never concerned about them: I wrote about them only to know whether the letters of that young man who is with me, which I sent along with the money through Falkner, were delivered. Those letters dealt with some impious statutes issued by our parliament around that time. But if you have received those letters, all is well. That young man, whose name is Francis Warner, often asked me whether they were delivered; I replied that I had no doubt about it, as we sent them through Falkner. My wife sends her heartfelt good wishes to you and your wife, and says she has no doubt that God helped her in her labor sooner because of your good prayers. On the second day of this month, she gave birth to a son for the church of Christ, a child of quite large stature for a woman of her height (as the women say), whom I immediately named Gersom. I am expecting letters daily, but there is no news from England. My wife sends her very diligent greetings to your most pious wife above all others: she also says that she wishes, I don't know what, that since she already has so many beautiful children with her, she will pray for the wife of Mr. Megander, that she too may bear children. Please convey my greetings to all those learned men with you, to whom the church of Christ is so much indebted, and may our Lord Jesus, the Prince of shepherds, grant them a great reward on that day, especially to you. Amen. Yours, RICHARD HILLES.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher of the church in Zurich, and especially esteemed by me. In Zurich.</p>
