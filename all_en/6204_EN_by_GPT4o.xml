      <p>Greetings. I immediately and opportunely gave the book and your attached letter, esteemed lord and father, as you wrote, to Johannes Heinrich Kaiser, so as not to neglect my duty; for he had just gathered the last packages to be sent to Italy.</p>
      <p>He promised all his efforts and faith, so there is no doubt that this good man will soon and safely receive the book according to his and our intentions.</p>
      <p>I wanted to inform your kindness of this in a few words, so that you might not be burdened with care or anxiety.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I rejoice that the Four Cantons, after a long and laborious dispute with our Glarus people, have reconciled. May the Lord God of peace remove the remaining occasion for dispute, which that fatal council, according to its nature, will not cease to pour cold water on to renew contentions, so that the peace initiated may be enjoyed perpetually by the reconciled, and we may see at some point a united Swiss homeland thus prepared by opportunity, so that, as we are united by mutual treaty, by God's mercy, with all enmity and bitterness removed, we may also mutually, with sincere religious agreement, uniquely worship God the Father through Christ the Son, our Lord, and serve Him alone according to His prescription.</p>
      <p>Although this may appear different, I dare to hope it will be so, trusting in God's mercy, who called us from the same darkness into this light beyond all our merit.</p>
      <p>We hear that the Guise and Savoyards are attempting many cruel things against the pious and their assemblies. May the Lord overthrow the plans of the impious! Surely these are exercises, so that we do not sleep securely, but with more ardent vows and continuous prayers, we may approach God, who will not abandon His own in the meantime with His protection, so that, having obtained relief, we may finally glorify His name. Farewell, in the Lord, venerable one.</p>
      <p>I conveyed greetings in your name to each one you instructed; they all greet you back fraternally and reverently along with your fellow ministers, and especially my son Joshua.</p>
      <p>I wish my dear Frisius and your son-in-law Lavater, excellent men, much well-being, etc.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, 6 days before the calends of August.</p>
      <p>Johannes Kessler, your most devoted.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, most renowned Antistes of the city of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
