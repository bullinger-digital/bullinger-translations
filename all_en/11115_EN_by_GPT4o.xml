    <p xml:id="regest1">It also seems to him that a further stay of Sebastian [Meyer] [in Bern] is not conducive to concord. Bullinger's depiction of how he himself would advocate for the Swiss churches with Luther does not take into account the fact that a mediator must necessarily speak of a rapprochement of positions. Recommends the letter carriers.</p>

      <p>About Sebastian, I will see. For it seems to me that it is useless for concord if he stays there longer.</p>
      <p>I have heard how you would like to be the envoy of the Swiss in this matter of concord. But, with your permission, I must say that this is of little relevance to the matter. The issue is who correctly understands the cause of the sacrament. In this, anyone who wishes to properly fulfill the role of mediator must concede to Luther that we have not entirely understood the matter, or if we have understood it, we have not expressed it as we felt. See, this is necessarily how it must be done with Luther, and anyone who wishes to present themselves as a mediator in this matter must say to us: Luther now feels differently than he did before, or certainly than he wrote before. But there is no other reason for mediation here. But more on this another time. I ask you, in all matters of Christ, to be as you are, and to devote yourself entirely to His kingdom.</p>
      <p>I very much desire that you receive these men with all the courtesy of humanity.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest brother. Greet Theodor and the brothers diligently for me.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Your Gryn√§us.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, dearest brother.</p>
