      <p>Greetings. The recent news, most illustrious and reverend father in Christ, which you have imparted to me, have been like a great gift; you announce many joyful things at once, which may God, the best and greatest, make stable and lasting! Certainly, our little priests have fallen from not a small hope, who for a long time have been nothing more insolent. The Abbot of St. Gall has plotted some clandestine plans with ours; the evidence of this was the frequent messengers and among others the steward (the master of the court of St. Gallen), who summoned ours to his. Ours had everything ready and prepared for the journey, as I remember his household saying to me. Now, however, regarding that departure, he is acting more leniently.</p>
      <p>They promised themselves much, indeed very much, about the outcome of the assemblies; now that everything turns out differently, they are clearly mistaken. How much audacity and recklessness he acted with in the Valtellina, it can be gathered from the fact that at the command of the pope he forcibly took Lutheran books from his own (in the same place, it is said to have been about 600 copies) and, without the knowledge of the captain, who has authority in those parts, without the knowledge of the governor and others to whom the main affairs pertain, he burned a large quantity of them with fire. These things are therefore kept secret by ours, as it seems better to reserve them for the next assembly to Captain Hercules of Salicibus, who recently passed through you; for the chief prefect in the Valtellina (they call him a captain) is not ours, etc. If the pope absolves subjects who have Lutheran lords from their oath, this matter will undoubtedly cause great disturbances in those parts; we first hear about that bull from you.</p>
      <p>I sent a boy to the castle to the orator with letters and instructions.</p>
      <p>If he has them, he will gladly share them according to his humanity. Now, because the couriers have ceased to be so frequent, these are difficult to obtain.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, I will write to the Italian brothers as soon as possible, so that if it can be done, we may extract something from there. We were convinced that peace had been made between the Turk and Ferdinand and that it was ratified and firm. When I read your letter in the presence of Mr. Tscharner and Captain Gregorio Carlin, the captain said that it was reported from Italy that the Turk had attacked some ports of Italy, etc.</p>
      <p>Whether this is so, I cannot easily affirm. Certainly, our sins do not allow the scourge of the Lord to rest.</p>
      <p>Here in the vicinity, there are many terrors. Recently, the priest of Zizers drowned disgracefully.</p>
      <p>One of the court of Drimmis, in a drunken manner, fell over the mountain from a height of about two church towers or more (as he walked incautiously) and was shattered to pieces. Three weeks ago at the latest, an honorable man who was bathing at Fideris was murdered on his way home in the Klus, which leads into the Br√§tigau, and thrown into the Langwart (a river). At Ragatz, a tree struck a man dead, it happened in the forest; as some were cutting wood, the tree fell down the mountain contrary to everyone's opinion and struck this man dead as a stone. In recent days, two honorable, wealthy women were crossing a bridge near Fideris, and when one began to feel dizzy, she clung to the other, and both fell into the water and drowned; they had a small child with them, which one carried over and then handed to the other. The child was found lying in the sun.</p>
      <p>A certain pastor saw these things, but from afar on the mountain, etc. Here in Chur, recently, one man struck another dead with a goad (an ox prod) at the gate in one blow. The Daminsers recently had their alp or shepherd's huts burned with all the milk, vessels, and equipment. Now, most recently, it is said that a stupendous thing has happened, which, however, since it is not so widely known and not yet sufficiently ascertained by me, will be more accurately investigated; therefore, I have separately attached certain things on a sheet, which you should keep until more certain information. Consul Tscharner says that the previous week someone was judged at Liechtensteig, who had committed all sorts of evil deeds and among other things had stabbed his own father in bed; it is the same one who set fire to the estate at Liechtensteig, where the hostess herself was burned with two others. He confessed how he, with the help of two others, set fire to Thusis; he is said to be a very young man, etc. For your Catechism, I thank you; the work is undoubtedly useful.</p>
      <p>The other one of Uncle Leo was more concise and obscure in the weight of sentences, as it was borrowed from Mr. Calvin, and I, as a boy, tormented myself almost in vain in teaching and understanding it. I would very much like, if the smaller Catechism were to be reprinted, that is, the form recited by the children in the temple, that a few things, especially necessary, be added; for thus we would more conveniently introduce that form into our church. Now it is accused by many as mutilated and imperfect.</p>
      <p>I will say what I think should be added: What is the Holy Spirit? There the children answer: He is the divine power, where it could be added: He is the third person in the holy, highly praised Trinity, the divine power and might, etc. What is the purpose of baptism? Answer: For repentance and improvement of life. Here only the final purpose is stated and indeed the latter, whereas it is also the role of the sacraments to seal divine grace for us. The same has been done in the sacrament of the Eucharist.</p>
      <p>Although these things seem of no weight, yet among the contentious they cause the greatest disturbances, and with three or four words they could be repaired so that nevertheless the same form of the catechism would remain. I know otherwise how dangerous it is to continually devise new forms.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest and most reverend father in Christ, with all yours most happily. May the marriage of your son Heinrich, by which the affinity between you and Gwalter, long ago initiated, is renewed and restored, be useful and fortunate for you all by the merciful God! Farewell again. Chur, July 5, 1559.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant. Please ensure that these letters are delivered to Mr. Collin, your father-in-law, as soon as possible. To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant overseer of the church of Zurich, his lord and most respected patron.</p>
