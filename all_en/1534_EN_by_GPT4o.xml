      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I have received news these days that there is a disagreement among the bishops of Trent; the Germans are pushing for that Imperial Interim, while the Italians, along with the Spanish, do not want to agree to it.</p>
      <p>The Emperor has intervened; but what will come of this contention, the Lord knows.</p>
      <p>The army of Maurice is in Mulhouse in Meissen; he has given that city to be plundered by the soldiers. It is now nothing but a clerical town. They refused to provide provisions to the soldiers and thus lost everything by that action. It is unknown where this army will move in the coming spring. Some think it will join with Cattus to free his parent, as he has a selection of soldiers in his domain; some believe Maurice will defend the French territories, while others think he will oppose King Ferdinand with this army against Turkish incursions. But I fear impending evil. What if they cause us harm?</p>
      <p>The Archbishop of Mainz had enlisted soldiers, but dismissed them the next day. Money has been given to Maurice's men. He has golden idols, which can most conveniently free him from these enemies, who seek gold and the devastation of churches and nothing else.</p>
      <p>The people of Frankfurt have only three gates open and are diligently vigilant, so they do not suffer any harm from enemies, whom they still do not know.</p>
      <p>Gutschick, the scoundrel, was beheaded. He was an enemy of the French soldiers and Mr. Schertlin, having often tried to kill him; but the majesty that shines in Mr. Schertlin terrified the scoundrel. He went to his execution completely dejected. He received money from Mr. Bollwill of Constance to plan such a crime. Few of the things the wretch committed were read publicly, perhaps not without reason, because of people of the same conspiracy. Farewell. Basel, January 13, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius sincerely.</p>
      <p>They say the council has been extended by two years.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Gwalther in my name.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
