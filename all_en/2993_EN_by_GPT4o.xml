      <p>S. D. For a long time, I have not written any letters to your kindness; hence, lest such a prolonged silence should breed any suspicion, I have now decided to make amends, if anything seems to have been omitted until now. By the grace of our prince and savior Christ, our Lord, the affairs of our church are well and peaceful. D. Pellicanus has migrated to the Lord in the full and sincere confession of faith; in his place, D. Peter Martyr has been called to profess sacred and Hebrew letters, who came to us last month and was received with public joy. Therefore, now alternately, the truly incomparable men D. Theodor Bibliander and D. Peter Martyr profess; the latter indeed narrates histories, the former explains the prophets; both have rare knowledge of languages, expertise in scriptures; both are eloquent and very well-versed in all arts and disciplines, hence they profess with the highest praise. The Saxons and Swabians, however, persecute us and condemn us in their churches because of the sacramental doctrine. You know what kind of books they have written against us; you have seen what has been answered to them by D. Calvin, D. Bernardino, and me. My booklet, once sent to you by me, is now being printed in German by the Gessner brothers. It is said that the adversaries have published very bitter and numerous books against us, which we have not yet seen, but we expect them from the Frankfurt fairs.</p>
      <p>We are very sorry that the brothers have flared up so; but we cannot remain silent and abandon a good cause, unless we wish to betray our holy duty. Meanwhile, let us pray that the Lord, by His grace, removes this great scandal from the church.</p>
      <p>I hear that among you, some dissension is arising from the fact that some insist that the angelic salutation should not be recited in the church for public discourse, while others assert that it must necessarily be recited. I think you and the others here should be vigilant, lest from small and contemptible injuries, a fire of hatred and discord flares up; for we are not ignorant of Satan's thoughts. I will tell you in good faith what happened among us: I published here in the year 1535 a form of ecclesiastical prayers; in it is contained the angelic salutation, but under the commemoration of the Lord's incarnation, which I took care to preface. For when I came here 24 years ago and found the angelic salutation being recited by custom immediately after the Lord's Prayer, I was horrified; not because I hated what was handed down in the scriptures, but because I understood that many were gravely sinning by the great abuse of the sacred matter and offering this salutation to the Virgin with a mind invoking her. I wanted to remedy this matter and therefore prefaced a little preface, as I just mentioned, if perhaps the superstition of those invoking might be removed; but in vain.</p>
      <p>For those who saluted continued to salute with a mind of veneration and invocation, to which we preachers were rightly said to offer occasion and confirm the wretched in error. Another thing also happened: our neighboring papists were boasting that the Zurichers recited the angelic salutation in the temple prayers, unlike the Bernese; they added: "The Zurichers still pray the Ave Maria and thus declare that they still venerate and invoke the Virgin; they still retain the feasts of the Virgin and the apostles; therefore, they are more tolerable than the Baselers and Bernese and Schaffhousians." Therefore, this matter could not be dissimulated any longer with great scandal; it was brought to the synod. What more? That recitation of the Ave Maria was abolished, so that henceforth it would not be joined with the Lord's Prayer in ecclesiastical prayers; the feasts were also abolished. There were many and grave reasons for this action: the example of Paul, who circumcised Timothy, but did not want to circumcise Titus; the offense of the pious and the confirmation of the papists in their professed error, moreover the ignorance of the old church of that recitation of the rite, the sincerity of prayer, and that the salutation was introduced into the church by the popes in the most corrupt times. For that notorious robber Gregory IX., whose decretals exist, vehemently promoted the abuse of this salutation. And since the error clings so deeply with firm roots in the minds of the common people, pastors should not dissimulate anything here. I have recounted these things somewhat copiously, to give you the occasion to consider these matters more diligently and to prevent strife from arising among the brothers because of this matter.</p>
      <p>In England, the queen severely persecutes the gospel; but Christ strengthens the minds of the faithful, so that they openly confess Christ, and then testify to their faith with blood as true martyrs, and indeed many.</p>
      <p>In Poland, princes and nobles aspire to the gospel, but the bishops with their followers diligently hinder it; the king hesitates between both sides. A diet has been convened for the feast of St. Bartholomew, in which the cause of religion will be discussed. Let us pray to the Lord that things may turn out well. Otherwise, the gospel is freely preached in many places in Poland; but the bishops, servants of the Antichrist, do not want to tolerate it.</p>
      <p>Hence the disputes; but truth will conquer and Christ will reign in the church.</p>
      <p>Your Rhaetian legate also adored the pope, rendered obedience, and promised all the most ample things to the see.</p>
      <p>A speech delivered by the bishop in the name of the Five Cantons and the Rhaetian legate has been brought to me; it is amazing that so much is permitted to him. But I have been too prolix and troublesome to you with this letter; forgive me this fault: I wanted to serve.</p>
      <p>Love me and all of us. Live and farewell and pray to the Lord for us. Farewell again. Greet your whole household.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 23rd August, in the year 1556.</p>
      <p>Your fellow ministers and all the brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man D. Johannes Travers of Zuoz, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
