      <p>Greetings. Since our Beza has promised to write, I will refrain from repeating the same things and unnecessarily burdening your ears, venerable brother, and will now abstain from matters concerning France.</p>
      <p>Here, we are quite troubled, as we see our city as if it were a board or a gaming table where dice are played.</p>
      <p>Our neighbors have been repeatedly asked to govern us with their counsel. Sometimes they wrote sparingly and coldly about what was being discussed, yet nothing except what was already known to everyone from common rumor.</p>
      <p>Recently, when they knew that envoys were coming to their city, they did not even indicate with a word what they thought should be done by our people.</p>
      <p>The Senate, however, did not dare to openly intervene or rather oppose actions unknown to them.</p>
      <p>They abused the pretext of this silence, those who were pleased to negotiate with the Savoyard, and secretly spread the rumor that we were plotting something and had envoys at the French court who would negotiate based on the outcome of events.</p>
      <p>Burdened by this false accusation among the ignorant, we were not as concerned as we should have been.</p>
      <p>Nor do I wonder that there were found among that populace those who were alienated from us by fabricated slander.</p>
      <p>But how did it come to your mind to believe such trivial lies? That you are concerned lest the French ensnare us with their flattery, and you admonish our mayor Roset to consider the example of the Senate of Metz, you indeed act in the duty of a faithful and sincere friend; but you should have smelled where this tale originated, unless perhaps Beza and I are suspect to you.</p>
      <p>Yet it will always be free for us to clearly testify that this plan was never conceived here nor were we tempted by the French.</p>
      <p>I go further: not only was there never any mention of this matter; but not even a thought crept in.</p>
      <p>I do not deny that two years ago I dealt with the admiral, so that, if possible, the king would enter into an alliance with the Bernese on this condition, that he would commit to defending the territory they possess today.</p>
      <p>But in this way, I wanted to ensure that they would never aspire to this city, and it was the best reason.</p>
      <p>Therefore, there is no reason for you to torment yourself with empty fear hereafter, until you learn from us that either the French are plotting something or our people are so alarmed that they rashly resort to their aid; indeed, experience will soon refute that vanity.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, know that your envoys, with the greatest effort possible, have insisted that the Bernese submit the freedom and status of our city to the judgment of the Cantons.</p>
      <p>But what else is this than to deliver us to be slaughtered? Thus, they achieved that the Bernese retracted all previous decrees.</p>
      <p>Now we hang in doubt.</p>
      <p>From this, I gather that you and other pious people are kept in the dark about many things.</p>
      <p>Moreover, such was the courtesy of your envoys at the Baden assembly, that to avoid envy, they ordered our people to abstain from all their conversations.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest man and most esteemed brother to me, together with your wife and family and all colleagues.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you all safe, sustain you with His strength, and bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Geneva, October 9, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
