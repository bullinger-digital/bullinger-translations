      <p>Greetings. A not at all bad custom has now spread, that even merchants, if they have received certain knowledge of things worthy of knowing, especially inform those whom they strive to benefit.</p>
      <p>I think it has happened for this reason that some of our people have enumerated in their letters the main articles which Emperor Charles recently proposed to the states for deliberation in Augsburg. However, it seemed strange to them why he proposed it so hastily, when not yet any of the secular princes, to whom the knowledge of these matters pertains above all, have been seen in Augsburg, and only a few bishops have been seen there, who otherwise are not unaware of the entire papal faction, to whom everything has been proposed, perhaps with the pretense that they should be taught about it by the Emperor as if they were ignorant of the matter.</p>
      <p>Everything is indeed full of pretenses and tricks; but many princes, not only sacred but also secular, are ridiculous even to the not entirely stupid common people, because they persuade themselves that impious plans to suppress the truth and confirm tyranny can be so hidden under these pretenses that even barbers, as if they were blind, do not understand. For he demands, above all, that the Council of Trent be continued, by which words it is clearly implied that the Emperor approves what has been approved most impiously in that assembly so far, and will further approve and consider valid what is condemned there with the rod of anathema. Certainly, it pleased Pilate to grant Christ, whom he considered worthless, to the Pharisees, so that they might drive the innocent to the cross; for his own convenience was of more value to him than the love of truth, which was hated by the world under the guise of novelty. How much more rightly would the reconsideration of that council, impure in many ways, have been entrusted to the deliberation of all the pious! But Lord Vergerius very truly warned that the pope would not tolerate that what he decreed for the sake of establishing his tyranny should be either lifted or introduced by anyone, and that what he condemned should be numbered among the pious and orthodox by anyone, not even Christ himself with his word clearer than the sun and his entire ancient holy church. - It is also demanded that there be mature deliberation on the restoration of ecclesiastical jurisdiction. And here indeed the Trojan horse is brought in with great pomp for the aid of piety; but in the judgment of all, it is full not only of the hunger and mendicancy of monks but also of the avarice of bishops and their suffragans, by whose efforts, pretenses, ceremonies, and even the terrors of laws and statutes, the purity of sincere piety will be forced to yield. There is no doubt that this devouring of wealth will rage far more pestilently than it ever dared before; for impudence rubs its forehead and arms itself with a marvelous panoply when it sees itself promoted by the efforts of great men and its enemies so restrained that they do not even dare to open their mouths. Deliberation is demanded on the repression of rebels. But perhaps those are considered rebels who, even unwillingly, are forced to repel force with force, and who, when they offer all their possessions to the Emperor, are proscribed for this one reason, that they do not want to admit impious doctrine and obey the impious commands of bishops. Against these, those are incited from all sides who rage, who, while sparing neither sex nor age and being more brutal than the Turks, are judged to be Catholics, while on the other hand, robbers, murderers, and arsonists, who ward off their nefarious atrocity from outside and homes and everywhere inflict sharper vengeance, are not obscurely taught to be true rebels who oppose the law of God, lest it can reign in the assembly of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Reformation is promised, which by right (if it were serious) should precede all deliberation; now, since it seems to be proposed only with pretense and in appearance, it always holds the last place. For the life of those who preside over the churches is more foul than that its mention can be omitted in any way. But what should be hoped for from it, the continuation of the Council of Trent itself demonstrates, which will not allow the morals of the bishops and the city of Rome to be accused nor permit that he who is praised by the Council of Trent itself as the holiest and to be preferred to the authority of all councils should not be held among the saints. What then? The Zwinglian and Lutheran churches, that is, the churches of Christ, made hateful by the names of men, will be reformed, and thus they will be reduced under the auspices of tyranny to the accustomed state, lest the brilliance of heavenly doctrine can harm or certainly inconvenience the fury of earthly wisdom in any way. But God will provide better things for us, and the plans of the impious will perish.</p>
      <p>These are what we have received about sacred matters; as for what that assembly will deliberate about profane matters, it is of no concern to us. - There is a rumor that the Emperor will appear with a famous delegation at the castle of the Baths; if this happens, you yourself will understand many things from your own people. Farewell and give many greetings in my name to the most esteemed man, Lord Peter Paul Vergerius; I did not have time to write, but I will write shortly. St. Gallen, on the 15th day of August, in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most splendid city of ZÃ¼rich, lord and most sincere friend.</p>
