      <p>My willing and all good beforehand, worthy and gracious lord. Dear lord, I hereby send you an imperial edict concerning the Dutch inquisition, where you will also learn that your and almost all pious, learned, and Christian men's writings, who have lived in our times, are to be forbidden, which causes great discord in the Netherlands. However, in Antwerp, it has not yet been published.</p>
      <p>But if it is published, all English, sea-town, upland, and Italian merchants will move away; they are already prepared for it. If it is then left to be resolved in that place alone, it is good to see where the problem lies. It was his intention to handle it similarly in Upper Germany; but I hope to God, he will not succeed. I hear that most of the imperial estates are not willing to consent to all requests. I also understand from a confidant that the emperor has dysentery along with other dangerous illnesses and is so disposed that he may not naturally live for 2 months. The same goes for Duke Heinrich of Brunswick, who undoubtedly tyrannizes against the city of Brunswick from his actions, also not well; they have shot him out of his camp, and as he wanted to withdraw from the city he besieged, many of his people were killed, and Duke Erich and he lost much artillery. Andrea Doria did not win the city of Africa in Africa, and Tragut defeated him at sea. There is still no secular prince at the Reichstag; none is expected to come. The emperor and his brother, the Roman king, are in conflict over the imperial election and otherwise in many matters, and in summary, things are difficult everywhere and otherwise, thank God, arranged in such a way that I do not need to write about it this time, as I hope to God, it will not follow the intended path, but soon after his praise, a much better path will be achieved. I should not have withheld all this from your worthiness as my highly trusted lord, to whom I commend myself in favor.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel on the 5th of September in the year 1550. Yours sincerely, Sebastian Schertlin, knight, subscribed.</p>
      <p>To the worthy and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, etc., to my gracious lord's hands.</p>
      <p>Return these enclosed and shared letters briefly and certainly.</p>
