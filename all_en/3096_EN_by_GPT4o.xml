      <p>Fran√ßois Hotman sends greetings.</p>
      <p>It was a great pleasure for me to understand from your most kind and loving letters that your spirit and dedication towards me are increasing more and more, and I am very grateful to you for the consolation you wrote in those letters. Although, by God's grace, it was not very necessary due to the illness of the body, which was indeed both mild and brief and has long since been cured, it was nevertheless timely and opportune for me because of the pain and sadness of the mind, which I have contracted here from many things. Almost every day, either pious, good, and learned men die or depart from here, while remarkable, malevolent men live, flourish, and thrive, by whom religion and discipline are so aided as if we are returning to papal disorder and confusion.</p>
      <p>In recent days, a certain message was brought to me that soon the catechism of Mr. Calvin, which we have used until now, would be changed in our little church, and another of such kind, as you can imagine, would be handed to us. This is being fought for by those whom I see place the entire religion in this one matter and almost contract it into a circle so that the opinion about the sacraments, which pleases them, may prevail. If they achieve this, all crimes are then connived at. Others, even if their lives are most temperate and chaste, are nevertheless counted as monsters and portents for this one reason. Thus, the Genevan church, which they are forced to admit is governed and contained by the strictest discipline, is now held in many places as an execrable and detestable filth.</p>
      <p>I recently experienced this in a very serious matter and with a most powerful man. Therefore, such matters bring me great cause for sorrow and have made your consolation most opportune for me. For my private affairs have never been in a better state by any benefit of God. Our school of civil law flourishes so much that I seem to be most favored by our senate for that reason. Finally, if any discipline were to thrive, I would consider myself blessed and happy. Since Mr. Martyr, the most outstanding and singular ornament of our church and school, departed, everything has also fallen into worse condition. It is said that Rabus, upon leaving, told the senate that he did not want to live there any longer, where there was a place for papists, Anabaptists, and sacramentarians. Mr. Zanchius perseveres constantly, bravely, and courageously in the work of the Lord, and I congratulate myself on having such a neighbor. If the Lord wills to have mercy on this city, which is now my homeland, He will give us pastors and theologians instructed by His spirit, who will defend some discipline in the church. But this Interimistic society is an enemy of all purity, so it seems to me that this place will be slippery for a young man unless some remedy is applied soon. I often also think about my dearest neighbor, your son, whose exceptional and singular character seems to me; but if I were given the choice and were in your place, knowing the discipline of the Lausanne school, I would prefer him to spend this age in a place where the wonderful examples of religion and virtue shine from all sides, rather than here, where due to papal filth and the sluggishness and inertia of men, many things are carried on, which if you knew, I do not doubt that you would have already rescued him from these dangers. Therefore, I beg you to do so, certainly to recall him from here, if not to Lausanne, then at least to a place where there is not such great freedom of vices; for I strongly disapprove of the mention he made of France. When Mr. Calvin was here, at my request, he exhorted him to probity with many words, and I do not doubt that he will follow domestic examples. Yet again, I add this, which I have so far kept silent, led by some hope of better discipline to come among us, that you recall him from here either to you or elsewhere, not because I have seen or noticed anything in him that does not please me (for I write this to you out of my piety and duty towards you, which I owe to you), but... I think that the danger from such an age should be removed in the utmost ruin of discipline and good arts. I do not doubt that your prudence and love towards me will accept my advice, written with the best intention towards you and him, in good part. Indeed, I earnestly and repeatedly ask you to do so.</p>
      <p>As for new matters to write about, I have almost nothing. Meanwhile, yesterday it was written to me that a royal edict was promulgated for all foreigners to depart. It is said that the Emperor aspires to the papacy and is stirring up these tragedies with that hope. The health of the Brandenburgian is entirely despaired of by the doctors. In Regensburg, there is now a convention where the restitution of that and the war against the Turks and religion are being discussed.</p>
      <p>King Ferdinand is present. Within a few days, Mr. Matthias Farrer, a man most loving of religion and an honor to our senate, will, God willing, enter the consulship. He is the one about whom the man of pious memory, Mr. Sleidanus, often affirmed to me that the greatest hope of the Interim's speech was placed in him. Therefore, I beg you to pray to God with the most ardent prayers for our church at this time. Indeed, I pray and beseech as much as I can that He may govern you and your most flourishing church and Mr. Martyr and your sons-in-law and the other faithful servants of God, your colleagues, with His Holy Spirit. Most illustrious man and most revered father, farewell. January 11, 1557.</p>
