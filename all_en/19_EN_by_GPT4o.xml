      <p>May He who is peace and truth itself grant us to love peace and truth, in the Lord, most revered and esteemed.</p>
      <p>How that contention, about which I recently wrote to you, arose between me and the people of Zofingen, and how it has now been resolved before the magnificent Bernese Senate, accept briefly and truthfully as follows.</p>
      <p>Firstly, during the colloquies held in Zofingen in the presence of my lord bailiff regarding a sermon that Göppelius, Benedict's associate, delivered in my presence, concerning the agreement established between us, which served to show that their delivered sermons were not against the agreement but rather concordant and fundamentally the same, etc. I opposed this as much as possible, as the agreement provided otherwise (as it indeed did), and therefore the articles from the colloquy and my lord bailiff were sent to the four arbitrators in Bern, etc.</p>
      <p>Following this, during the Christmas season, my lord bailiff (by special command) heard Mr. Benedict and then Göppel preach about the matter. Göppel again referred to his previous sermons and acted as before. The following Sunday, when they again (according to their custom) began the communion, Benedict preached but did not follow your admonition in the article of your response beginning: "I see, my dearest Benedict," etc., and thus not only attacked the opposing party but rather asserted the truth by communicating with Göppel, etc., which scandalized many. Furthermore, Benedict stood with Göppel before the choir court in Zofingen on the Friday before Christmas, and when Nicolaus Huober, a senator of the order in Zofingen, admonished them that they were teaching about the communion contrary to the held disputation, they gave him no clear answer; instead, they entrusted it to God and the authorities, as many others do, and thus proceeded in their way and conducted communion twice without any order, etc.</p>
      <p>Afterwards, my lords wrote to me to report on the aforementioned matters, which I now do, and also to Mr. Benedict; he has completely surrendered and wishes to excuse himself with you and your response and to do his best in the future and more of such things, and has come into a new dispute with Mr. Batten (unnecessary to mention now), so that he was also sent for advice about it. And after Mr. Benedict appeared three times before the council and the four arbitrators as well, he was ordered to return home with further instructions.</p>
      <p>Following this, Göppel, my lord bailiff, Nicolaus Huober, and I were summoned on the 16th of this month and heard on the 17th, with the four arbitrators also called. The process lasted from eight until twelve. Firstly, the writings of my lord bailiff were read, in which he orderly recounted all the causes of this dispute in a church in Zofingen, mentioning all the inconveniences that followed and finally admonishing my lords that they wished to remove the stumbling block from a corner, which they had borne long enough for the sake of the people, to avoid God's punishment, which had passed over the city, undoubtedly because of the unequal teaching about the communion, etc. Secondly, my letter was read, which was of the same opinion.</p>
      <p>Thirdly, Göppel was called to answer the two letters. After this happened, my lord bailiff requested to hear the established agreement. Eberhard from Rumlang read it. Then Mr. Joß Göppel was asked if he considered the agreement to be Christian and right, etc. To which he answered: yes, etc.</p>
      <p>Fourthly, Göppel requested to read and answer his sermon delivered on Christmas Day, which was granted to him.</p>
      <p>Then Mr. Joß spoke along with his assistant. We are surprised if the congregation could understand the obscure sermon, which we submit to your lords; secondly, our lords heard that he did not once mention the words about the communion nor explain them according to the content of the read agreement, etc.</p>
      <p>Fifthly, there was a long apology with cunning excuses presented by Göppel, to which the bailiff strongly opposed, especially with the exhibition that it is a wonderful work of God; Göppel could not refute the bailiff, for he knew much, spoke here and there, but through false brothers and informers, and was drawn in as a witness. Upon this, his brother-in-law, friend Dorrman and friend Steyger, stood by him, and my lords had to recognize whether the bailiff was a witness or not. It was recognized that he is an official and does what my lords recommend to him, etc., and not a witness.</p>
      <p>Sixthly, the four men, along with the bailiff, had to testify against Göppel with his own handwritten writings about the lies and untruths he preached in Zofingen.</p>
      <p>Thus, it goes harshly, his silence... to convict the Lutheran and Bucerian writings, etc.</p>
      <p>Seventhly, it came to Huober. That gave a long matter. In summary: he is a butcher and my bailiff a tailor, and I consider it a wonderful work of God, that, "the lips of many preachers have been made mute and the so-called eloquent lips of laymen in defending the recognized truth against the disputation in Bern."</p>
      <p>May God help me, such a glorious fight and victory in the Bernese disputation was not heard as before at that place (I did not speak a word, nor was I asked, but the written letters spoke).</p>
      <p>Eighthly, we were presented. The full Senate was present except for the mayor from Wattwil, the venerable from Gravenreyd, the venerable Dillger, and Rudolf from Erlach. The response was thus given in a great assembly of the people with the assisting mayors in the Bernese manner. Thus Nagelius spoke: Herly, herly (to Göppel), my lords have now heard your dispute and quarrel long enough, what it is and how it is conducted. Not long ago, you swore and established an agreement and did not keep it, but you continue with your preaching and teaching, which you have now mentioned and my lords understood, that it does not adhere to what you should have adhered to. Therefore, it is my lords' will and opinion that they do not wish to tolerate this dispute and quarrel in their city or land any longer and have therefore expelled both of you, Benedict and Göppel; that is for one. Secondly, you both should give the bailiff, Mr. Peter, and Huober their incurred costs.</p>
      <p>And this is, in the shortest, how I report to you and other my dear lords, fathers, and brothers in haste about such a long matter. God knows, many honorable men heard the swift words, cunning, and tricks of Göppel (a fox over a fox) and the handy handling of those two men, here worthy of laurels, because the spirit of truth made their tongues eloquent to assert the truth once acquired, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest lord, with all the pious. From Aarburg, on the 21st of January, 1548.</p>
      <p>Peter Sartorius.</p>
      <p>To my especially trusted dear lord and brother in Christ our Lord, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
