    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer wrote just yesterday [with No. 3066]. However, John Butler just showed him a letter he received from Strasbourg. At Blarer's request, Butler copied a passage concerning the Swiss Confederates. He includes the little sheet with the present letter to ensure that he does not fail to share something that might be of importance to the Swiss Confederates.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] May God grant protection from the present dangers and bestow a glorious victory! Blessing wish.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] If Bullinger still has the booklet concerning England [“Mandatorum epitome”] transmitted by Vadian, he should let Blarer read it as soon as possible.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you yesterday. But now our Butler has shown me letters sent to him from Strasbourg, which I immediately asked him to copy, those parts that seemed relevant to you. He complied and sent the enclosed note, which I decided to send to you, so that I do not omit anything that might be of any importance to you, as you should know.</p>

      <p>May the Lord, relying on His help, make us secure from these evils and grant us a glorious victory! In this, my venerable and dearest brother, farewell to you and all yours. November 3rd.</p>

      <p>If you still have the booklet concerning English matters, which Vadian sent to you, I earnestly ask you to send it to me to read as soon as possible. Yours, A. Bl.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest and best brother. Zurich.</p>
