      <p>Greetings. You almost overwhelm me, Bullinger, with that perpetual generosity, which you heap upon me anew time and again, and I clearly see that I will sooner run out of words to give you the thanks you deserve than you will run out of new ways to bind me to you, unworthy as I am.</p>
      <p>You have indeed won, not by competing with you in generosity; for I have never even attempted this, knowing full well that I could not match you in this regard. But your many good deeds surpass my words, which I feel are utterly exhausted, while you, on the other hand, seem to have an endless spring from which to overwhelm me.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I will now do nothing else but pray to the most good and great God with my most earnest prayers through His Christ, that He may always increase and preserve the gifts He has bestowed upon you through His Holy Spirit, so that you may flourish like a green olive tree in His house even in old age, as you did in your youth. And if there is or ever will be anything by which I can please you through my work, fortune, or even myself, I will clearly demonstrate my most grateful spirit to you. As for your request that I take the authority to judge your most learned and truly Christian writings and freely advise you if anything displeases me, you ask in vain, for you know how much I love you and how much I admire and revere all your works, so that you would hear nothing but your praises if I were to write my judgment here.</p>
      <p>However, if there were anything in your sermons that I saw as not written according to Christ's teachings or alien to the analogy of faith, I would certainly inform you. But what can one see, I ask, who has always been regarded as blind by all love?</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, since this love between us is united by a common zeal for piety and truth, he will easily understand what is abhorrent to the spirit of truth, of which none have yet appeared in all that I have read of yours. May Christ always preserve us in that truth, which arose in the world through Him and for which He fervently prayed that His disciples be sanctified by the Father. Amen.</p>
      <p>I am sending a question, to which I earnestly beseech you, my dear Bullinger, to respond with a single word.</p>
      <p>You will do this through our messenger; I do not want you to write any further words to me this time, but you will note something in your own hand regarding the question and return it to my hand.</p>
      <p>I am very eager to know what Lord Michael Schlatter has been doing there these days; for a certain man, not at all given to falsehoods, hinted to me that he said some very bitter and even very obscure things against his fellow minister Funck among some good brothers during his journey, which pains me all the more because I can rightly suspect that he may have allowed himself the same liberty among you, given his otherwise pious and learned nature. If this is the case, I implore you by our love not to conceal from me in good faith how this matter stands, as you will hear from me. For some excellent and leading men explained to me in Bielefeld a few months ago the causes of the discord and the blame, which they placed much more on Schlatter than on Funck. I have loved Funck greatly from his youth for the remarkable gifts of God that shone in him and have regarded him almost as a son; he, in turn, has always respected and honored me as a parent, so that I have been accustomed and still am to exhort, admonish, and rebuke him whenever necessary. But if I learn that new tragedies have arisen between him and Lord Michael due to Funck's fault and intemperance, which I can hardly bring myself to believe, you will see that I will ensure he does not plan anything further of this kind. Just make sure I know whether good Schlatter has done or complained about anything regarding my Funck there.</p>
      <p>The dear man Mr. Michel is a pious, capable, but very quick-tempered and hasty man, often doing things in haste that he later regrets. A good man told me that he claims he cannot stay alongside this young Swabian, who has truly always been a good and decent young man, although I hear he had also claimed this before Funck arrived, who was truly well-regarded and esteemed; he might well go from horses to donkeys and give a horse for a sack whistle. May the Lord grant him the best understanding and action. In this, farewell well and eternally with all yours, and always commend me and mine to your sacred prayers. March 12, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
