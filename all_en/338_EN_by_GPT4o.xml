      <p>Greetings from the Lord. I recently wrote to you through our Leopold and requested from you those notes you once entrusted to me on the Gospel according to Matthew; but so far I have received nothing, and I do not think you have become more difficult towards me than usual, but I judge it happened for some other reason, perhaps you did not have them at home at the time, or later you forgot, overwhelmed by other occupations. If you are willing to share them with me now, you will have a reliable and trustworthy man, Caspar Feniggi, who will come to us on St. Martin's Day; I will ensure they are returned shortly in good faith and intact. Afterwards, I will request from you what you have on Isaiah, once I have completed what you will give on Matthew.</p>
      <p>As for the state of the present time, I feel it is such that no one can lament it with due dignity. Dangers are now threatening from all sides, and it is not enough that we expect the attacks and assaults of the emperor, the most savage enemy of truth, unless our own domestic allies, joined by a pact of society, almost try to rule over us, to which this evil is added, that among us the seditious sect of the Anabaptists is again being stirred up, in which many, whom we least expected, are discovered. All kinds of evils are present at once; Satan does not sleep. They would have caused much turmoil shortly, had it not been prevented by divine goodness, they have already changed somewhat in their former error, they no longer completely abolish the magistracy; they have lengthy prayers, as I hear, for the magistracy, but not sincerely, because they do not wish to obey, only so that they may now have a somewhat milder magistracy than before, when they completely condemned it as impious.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant that we remain vigilant, lest more tares be sown in the Lord's field through our negligence. The evil spreads into the hearts of the simple due to the hypocrisy of seditious scoundrels, and therefore we must now work harder to fortify the hearts of men with salutary antidotes against this most pestilent poison; for it is pleasing to the flesh if liberty becomes a pretext for malice. Farewell, and I ask you to deign to assist me in this, and, as before, to hold me commended to you. My wife sends her greetings to you. Please greet on my behalf Mr. Gwalther and the other lords and brethren. November 7, 1548. Aarau.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his lord as to a most revered father.</p>
