      <p>Greetings. What I foresaw when I was recently with you is now out in the open. I would gladly detail everything precisely, but my illness and the lack of time prevent me. The Republic of Augsburg has easily reached an agreement with the allied princes.</p>
      <p>The people of Ulm reject both the pure religion and the privileges of their ancestors completely; therefore, they only agree with the papists. They have perhaps drawn hope and consolation that will never appear. I indeed fear greatly that they will be miserably overwhelmed within a few days. They are entirely deprived of their territory and possessions; if they are furthermore expelled from the city, they will scarcely be a village, as the princes have sworn. The King of France is waging war on the Rhine, but I do not know with what intentions. Duke Maurice of Saxony has negotiated peace with King Ferdinand at Linz, who is moving every stone to settle the matter; he has already gone to the Emperor to report the conditions of peace to the princes within three days, which, as one of the princes told me, are such that they should not be rejected by the Germans.</p>
      <p>Therefore, peace and war rest after God in the discretion of the French, who will undoubtedly reconsider how much trust and concession should be given; for previous agreements make him cautious. As far as I can conjecture, almost all the princes of Germany, except for the bishops (who in my judgment will soon lose their principal title), are unanimous, though not openly. Indeed, a great opportunity for regaining liberty is offered to us, if we wish to use it; but since so many papists have recently emerged over the years, among whom the loss of Ulm is not the least, it is unknown what God has intended.</p>
      <p>The magistracy of Augsburg has been restored to its former order, but through ignorance or rather negligence, it happened that the worst papists were admitted to the senate, so that the pious cannot even utter a word against the kingdom of Satan without it being revealed to the adversaries. They further think that they will be expelled at some point, oh what a fallible calculation. I also hear that some of our former ecclesiastics have been recalled; but why they are not yet present, I do not know. The malevolent argue greatly about their oath not to return to the city; if the oaths of the Imperial Senate could be dissolved, then in my judgment, those made under compulsion against piety and justice can also be dissolved. I am and will be entirely devoted to this, that the kingdom of God be sought first, regardless of what may follow. Since such a great change of affairs has occurred here and it was in doubt whether I was free from all civic duties and sacraments, I most urgently requested the benefit of liberation, which I could not obtain; therefore, they offered me my former position, from which I so recoil that I would rather endure the harshest things than be entangled again. This matter of mine, having been long and much debated here and there, finally came to the point that I accepted the position of advocate... and councilor of the senate, and it would have been well with me, if not for the prolonged movements of war and if... the Augsburg Confession, namely semi-papism, had not tormented us for a long time. I had indeed resolved entirely within myself to go to the Swiss for the sake of sound religion; but there was scarcely any open place for me there. I have certainly often wondered not a little why Laetus, being in exile, has been so abandoned, who nevertheless has so greatly endeavored to do good to strangers. Therefore, let it still be done, what is good in the eyes of the Lord. I implore you earnestly to write to me sometime; now it is not as dangerous to write as it was.</p>
      <p>The Republic of Nuremberg has long since, though secretly, agreed with the liberators of the fatherland. How the people of Strasbourg will conduct themselves, a few days will reveal; it is indeed reported to me that they will soon be similar to the people of Augsburg.</p>
      <p>You, for whom the fight is now also being fought, pray to the Lord for the happy and salutary progress of these matters, so that, if any do not lend a hand, they may lend their spirit. I truly do not know how safe you would have been at some time, if our calamity had not been your bulwark. Farewell, most illustrious and dearly beloved man.</p>
      <p>Convey my greetings to all good men, especially to the lords councilors, Gwalter, Haller, Gessner, Bibliander, Pellican, Gwalff, Frisius, etc.</p>
      <p>Hastily from Augsburg, May 10, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Georg Laetus, counselor of the Republic of Augsburg.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and highly learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief of the church of Zurich, my particularly dear lord. Zurich.</p>
