      <p>Honorable and gracious sir, on the 20th of this month was my last letter, with it two letters from Duke Hans Wilhelm, along with a new newspaper from Sweden; I hope it has reached you before this one. On the same day at night, your letter was delivered to me by this messenger, dated February 10th. In it, I was pleased to hear the news from France, because although we have many newspapers here, there is nothing truthful and substantial; people here also say that something significant is happening in France; a battle is said to have occurred, with about 4000 on both sides having fallen, but Condé is said to have gained the field and victory. Some also claim that there is peace; may the Lord grant his blessing to it. Also, Duke of Alba is said to be quite fearful, as he is gathering many troops; for if peace were to come in France, the situation might shift there; herewith a small note of what has been written from Antwerp.</p>
      <p>Further, after I last mentioned to you about Mr. Laurentius Durnhofer, my friendly request to you remains, that you would assist him with a small letter. I have just been with him, and he sends you his willing service and friendly greetings; he also asked me, since I am related to you, that you would send him these books as soon as possible, according to the contents of the enclosed note. Please let me know the cost, and I will gladly reimburse you. Please arrange for the mentioned books to be sent as soon as possible to Mr. Hans Liener in St. Gallen, asking him to send them here as soon as possible; please make this effort and let yourself be served in return. Herewith also a letter from your cousin Heinrich Hedinger; he is, thank God, fresh and healthy. And with this, I commend you to the protection and care of the Almighty.</p>
      <p>Dated February 22 in Nuremberg, 1568. Your willing servant, Gabriel Schlüsselberger.</p>
