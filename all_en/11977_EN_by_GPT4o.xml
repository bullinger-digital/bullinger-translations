    <p xml:id="regest1">The request made by Bullinger in the name of the college for the composition of a biography of Zwingli [No. 1910] causes him distress, not only because he does not feel up to the task, but because he feels obliged out of love for them to openly express his opposition. In these turbulent times, such a publication would only provoke opponents and lead to new tensions - also with the secular authorities; it should therefore be postponed. Zwingli's biography should be recorded in the form of simple annals based on the testimonies of those who knew him and kept in the chapter archive until a time comes when his fame can be spread without rekindling disputes; the composition could be undertaken by [Johann Jakob] Ammann or [Rudolf] Collin. The works of Zwingli published by the people of Zurich [BZD C 340; VD 16 Z 761] also bear witness to him, but as the poet [Baptista Mantuanus] says, only posterity will judge without envy.</p>

      <p>Greetings. From your recent letters, most learned Bullinger, in which you requested on behalf of the college that I undertake the task of writing the life of our Zwingli (for even among the blessed he is still ours), I was moved with much reluctance. Not only because I saw that a task was being imposed on someone who could neither match the labor with his spirit nor his pen, but far more because I saw it necessary to express how greatly I disagreed with your opinion, even though I agree with you and yours in all other matters. I am compelled to do this not out of any boldness or confidence in my own mind, but primarily out of love, which I believe obliges me to conceal nothing from those we care for, regarding what we judge to be right, honorable, and beneficial. To say briefly what I think: it seems to me most unwise that at this time, so turbulent in many ways, with minds so hostile and judgments so unfair, Zwingli's life should be committed to writings that are soon to be published. For although his life is most worthy of everyone's knowledge, filled with notable duties, learning, piety, and that fervent zeal for promoting piety and improving the lives of many, yet it would incur envy not only among the impious, to whom the word of the Lord is intolerable, but even among some who are commended to the world under the name of piety (I say nothing of those who attack him with dire reproach), so that there is no doubt that if he were praised in the present time in a manner deserving of his merits, they, unable to bear such praise, would rouse some antagonist who would harm by criticizing as much as we could possibly benefit by praising. Moreover, it would be necessary to remember that at his death, which could provide an opportunity for some vehement alienation of minds among the irritable people, not without trouble for the magistrates. Therefore, if you listen to me and weigh the matter as it stands with your singular learning and prudence, you will consider deferring the matter to another time and not be in a position to pour oil on a fire (as it is said) that is otherwise already burning more than enough and scattering sparks here and there. It would seem most advisable to me to record his entire life from his homeland, childhood, and remaining years, in which places, duties, and functions he spent it, by what skills he excelled, what character he had, who among the best were his friends, what he aimed for most in his entire life, from those who are well acquainted with all his deeds and words, in the manner of annals, with a simple style and free from all affectation, and to store it in the college archive and keep it suppressed for more than nine years, and then finally, when things, as I hope, are in a much better state and the heat, which the embers of our recent fire still feed, is more extinguished, to publish it to the great benefit of Zwingli's glory. In the meantime, there will be Ammanns and Collins who will abundantly fulfill this task. Meanwhile, the works you publish will testify to what kind of man he was, although even in this part recent judgments are not very fair. For it is true what the old poet says: The present age judges poorly with the disease of envy, a better judgment will be that of posterity. Farewell and consider the opinion of a friendly man kindly. St. Gallen, June 21, 1544.</p>
