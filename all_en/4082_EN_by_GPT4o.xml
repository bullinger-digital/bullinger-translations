      <p>Greetings. The reason I have not written to your Excellence for a long time is the lack of news, not a lack of will and obedience. From Rome, I have nothing (and I have now received letters) that is not old and already known to you; for everything was known to me. But our letters acquire age in the circuit and journey, as couriers no longer pass through here. If your Excellence has anything, I ask you to share it with us.</p>
      <p>From Constantinople, it is written that Bayezid is besieged by his brother Selim and is almost reduced to the utmost danger of life or captivity. Finally, having seized the opportunity from Selim's negligence during a festive celebration, which the entire army was then celebrating, he freed himself from the siege and fled towards the Persians. This will indeed bring great harm to that empire due to the discord and divisions of these brothers. May God open the eyes of our princes and direct their hearts to expel those who are truly unfaithful. From France, I understand nothing that is new or unheard of.</p>
      <p>A new Doge has not yet been elected in Venice, and great and unusual controversies arise among them due to the ambition of some, which indeed distresses and torments the leaders. I offer myself as your Excellence's most devoted servant.</p>
      <p>Chur, Rhaetia, September 18, 1559. Your Excellence's most observant and devoted, Jean Jacques de Cambray.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, excellent in piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the ZÃ¼rich church, his esteemed lord and friend.</p>
