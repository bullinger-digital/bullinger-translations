    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Calvin read Bullinger's book as soon as he returned home. As promised, he has not told anyone about it. He hopes that Bullinger will receive the present evaluation of this book well. It would be nice if both came to the same opinion. If not, may Bullinger still receive this open assessment well, especially since he knows that Calvin values him and this letter comes from a sincere heart. Calvin will briefly comment on each chapter. This commitment should not be seen as that of a censor. Rather, it expresses Calvin's conviction that Bullinger does not need lengthy explanations.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It is unnecessary for Bullinger to distinguish between different types of signs (signa) in his 1st chapter, as if they were mutually exclusive.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In the 2nd chapter, Calvin does not like that the sacraments of baptism and the Lord's Supper are associated with the military oath based on etymological considerations. Calvin observes that from the beginning of the church, Latin speakers used the word "sacramenta" to render the Greek word μυστήρια. This is already evident in the older translations of the Old and New Testaments. Therefore, Calvin thinks that the Latin word "sacramenta" was used from the beginning in the sense of the Greek word.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] In the 3rd chapter, Bullinger misuses Paul's passage where he writes that "everything [the Hebrews experienced at the Red Sea, in the wilderness, and with the manna] were representations (figurae) [of future events]."</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] In the 5th chapter, Bullinger rightly emphasizes that God never promised to be physically (corporaliter) present with the signs. However, Calvin would have wished for greater clarity from Bullinger here. It is clear that when Jacob saw the Lord take his place on the ladder, he only saw an embodied (corporalis) representation of the Lord. But what Bullinger then discusses about symbolic expressions (symbolicae locutiones), he should have elaborated on at the appropriate place to avoid having to repeat it there. Moreover, Bullinger's argumentation is not compelling. He claims that the words "Do this in remembrance of me" exclude a real presence (realis praesentia) of the things to be remembered. However, Calvin believes that this presence is true (vera), especially since what is remembered is true. In the Lord's Supper, something present is remembered, even if the remembrance presupposes something absent. There is no contradiction here. For the eyes, for the senses, and spatially, Christ is absent because his body (corpus) is in heaven. But in the Lord's Supper, he acts on the distant earth. Through his Spirit, he is present for the soul of the devout. The distance does not prevent him from nourishing (pascere) his own, even if it becomes clear from Paul's exhortation to remember Christ's death until he comes again that Christ does not come down to us from heaven in the Lord's Supper. He is present only through faith. This spiritual connection (coniunctio) with him does not exclude his return. Moreover, there is nothing against him truly offering himself to the believer in essence (essentialiter), even if he remains in heaven until the resurrection of the dead. Regarding heaven, Calvin fundamentally shares Bullinger's stance: The word "heaven" denotes a place and not a mere state. However, Bullinger is too harsh with those who see it differently. When he claims at the end of his chapter that the Lord said it is of no use to eat his flesh (caro) "corporaliter," not everyone will agree with him unless he means "corporaliter" in a physical way (corporali modo). Incidentally, Bullinger's argumentation does not require such a claim, for many who hold to a real eating (realis manducatio) do not believe in a carnal (carnalis) one!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Calvin does not agree with Bullinger when he claims in the 6th chapter that the word "benedictio" is never used in the sense of consecration (consecratio). This is refuted by the following passage from Paul: "The cup of blessing (calix benedictionis), which we bless (cui benedicimus)...". This sentence construction does not allow [the word "benedicere"] to be understood as thanksgiving (gratiarum actio). It can only be a consecration of the symbols (symbola) used in the Lord's Supper; a consecration that Bullinger also acknowledges. Calvin also believes that Bullinger weakens his argumentation in this chapter with too many irrelevant explanations and annoys his readers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] In the 8th chapter, Bullinger defines the relationship (unio) between the sign and the signified (res signata) in a not entirely satisfactory way. Calvin, together with him, rejects any crude or superstitious conception. However, Bullinger should have emphasized more how truly God accomplishes what he represents (figurare). Bullinger explains the relationship between the sign and the represented through an analogy (analogia), which is too weak, as the relationship established in the sacrament completes the sign (complementare), so that the latter is not empty (inanis), especially since the Lord, through his Spirit, accomplishes in us what he depicts in the sign (repraesentare). In the Lord's Supper, there is indeed, as Bullinger writes, an analogy between the bread and the body of Christ, between his blood and the wine. But since the relationship [between bread and body, wine and blood] arises from our connection with Christ, our soul is truly nourished (pascare). Bullinger's explanation is therefore too meager (ieiuna), and this is entirely (as Calvin will discuss below) the result [of Bullinger's refusal] to use the verb "offer" (exhibere) [in connection with the sacraments]. Moreover, it bothers Calvin that the metonymies present [in the words of institution] are explained using examples from profane life. Of course, there is a certain similarity here. But it should also be emphasized that the metonymies in the Lord's Supper are not of the same nature. Is the spirit of the emperor in his image, so that it becomes animated and effective in us? Calvin knows exactly that many people (including Philipp Melanchthon) were upset about Zwingli's teaching precisely because he failed to clarify this in the comparisons (comparatio) he used. Therefore, many believe that Zwingli turns the Lord's Supper into a theatrical spectacle (theatricum spectaculum)!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] In the 10th chapter on grace (gratia), Bullinger should first establish that the free gifts (dona gratuita) emanating from grace are often used for the word "grace" and vice versa, the word "grace" for the gifts it produces. Furthermore, Bullinger is much too strict towards the word "confer" (conferre). This gives the opponent the opportunity to accuse him of distorting his statements (which are not meant to be so extreme). However, those who say that the sacrament confers grace do not always mean that it confers righteousness [of Christ] or the like! They merely assert that in the sacrament, man is provided with the graces of God (nobis administrare dei gratias), just as when Fabius explains that birds feed their chicks with their beak. Bullinger should therefore be more lenient here to avoid appearing spiteful. By the way, what is so absurd about the sentence "The sacraments are aids (adiumenta) so that God's grace can be grasped (percipere)"? Calvin admits (and this will not have escaped Bullinger) that the verb "grasp" [used by him] is less strong than the verb "confer." But if Bullinger considers that the gift of the Spirit is the soul of the sacraments, he will have to fully agree with the statement "Grace is conferred through the sacraments" (sacramentis conferri gratiam). If such a statement still seems too problematic to him, then it would suffice for him to refrain from it or to weaken its meaning. Calvin also believes that there is no reason to refer so often to Bonaventura's quote in this chapter. However, Bullinger regrets that Bonaventura referred those who lacked God's grace to the sacraments. Certainly, God does not transfer (transferre) his glory (gloria) to the elements [of the sacraments]. But is God's glory really transferred to the created when it is emphasized that God uses the created as a tool (organum) to distribute his graces (distribuere)? Does the sun not illuminate the earth? And does the bread not nourish (alare)? Bullinger emphasizes so much that God calls man to himself and does not refer him to the sacraments because he believes that the sacraments have become obstacles for [Calvin and the like-minded] and keep them from Christ! But it is the Papists who make the sacraments an obstacle and thereby keep people from Christ!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Bullinger ends the 10th chapter by emphasizing that anyone who believes in Christ is justified by faith before participating in the sacraments. According to him, this makes it clear that the sacraments do not confer the grace of God. Calvin sees it differently: Because we were justified, grace is conferred on us through the sacraments, as the latter are exercises of faith (fidei exercitia) that richly bestow spiritual gifts on us (cumulare), make us partakers (participes) of Christ, and promote our faith (promovere). Do they accomplish this by themselves? By no means! They accomplish this only as long as the elect maintain faith and the Spirit of Christ works in them through faith. Without faith, the sacraments are lifeless and useless.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Calvin was very surprised to find that Bullinger not only denies in his 11th chapter that something is offered in the Lord's Supper but is even very upset about the use of the word "offer" (exhibere)! Bullinger emphasizes that the Thomists introduced it. But how is God's truth compromised by the use of this word? When Christ hands me the bread and wine, he promises me his body and blood. Bullinger asserts that the believer only receives the signs and not simultaneously the signified (res [signata])! If this were true, the Lord's Supper would be a farce. "Offer" means nothing other than "to present for enjoyment" (fruendum dare). But Bullinger denies that such a thing takes place in the sacrament, precisely because only God can accomplish such a thing. Calvin does not doubt the latter, as he also sees in the sacraments only an instrument in God's hand and attributes any efficacy of the sacraments to the Spirit of God. However, Bullinger argues that the sacraments, because they do not contain (continere in se) God's grace by themselves, cannot offer anything! This conclusion is wrong! Even if in a certain sense the sacraments do not include (includere) God's grace, Calvin believes that they do contain (continere) God's grace, just as when one says that the Gospel contains Christ. Moreover, we also say that Christ is offered to us through the Gospel. Or is Paul perhaps mistaken when he writes that the Corinthians attained communion (communio) with Christ through the Gospel? Because Calvin believes this, he has not become blind! He sees very well what needs to be distinguished! Bullinger will demand biblical passages for Calvin's view. To this, Calvin replies that Bullinger's view is not supported by Scripture! Paul says that the church was cleansed through the washing of water. Bullinger will respond that this is a symbolic expression (symbolica loquutio) and conclude that the water is a sign. Calvin agrees. But Bullinger is not yet out of the woods. The symbol would accomplish nothing [i.e., could not cleanse] if it were empty and illusory. Therefore, it is rather the guarantee (pignus vel obsignatio) of the cleansing it represents. Therefore, the term "offering" (exhibitio) is necessary. Another example: "This is my body, which is given for you." Bullinger and Calvin both agree that the bread is a sign. But Bullinger denies that it offers anything; Calvin does not. Bullinger thinks he has explained the difficulty (nodum) with the term "sign." But this is not true, for a divine, empty sign is worthless. The bread is not only there to remind me that the body of Christ was sacrificed for me. The bread is also given to me as food (cibum) to nourish me (vescari). For Christ said: "Take" and "eat." This must not be forgotten! Therefore, Paul also speaks in this context of a communion (κοινωνία). Calvin knows that this word has also been abused. But he does not want to dwell on it here. It suffices to emphasize that those present at a genuine Lord's Supper become partakers of Christ by being offered the represented (res figurata).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Now to the passages [in this chapter] where Bullinger does not comment on the Lord's Supper or baptism. Bullinger denies that when Christ breathed on the apostles, the Holy Spirit was in his breath, since the Spirit cannot be spatially limited. But no one (not even the Papists) advocates such a limitation. Nevertheless, Calvin believes that there is a connection (albeit not a spatial one) between the breathing and the Spirit. The sign is not empty. The associated truth is present. Here it should be emphasized that it is important to distinguish between human and divine signs! Man can represent things with signs; the latter, however, do not materialize. Only God can accomplish something through his Spirit that he represents with a symbol. Similarly, the dove is to be equated with the Spirit. Bullinger denies this, but in such a way that he seems to admit this agreement! He says that the dove is the testimony of the presence (testimonium praesentiae) of the Spirit. Calvin demands nothing more! Of course, the dove is not the Spirit in substance (substantialiter). It is enough to emphasize that the presence of the Holy Spirit is demonstrated (exhibere) with the symbol of the dove. What Bullinger writes about it otherwise has little to do with the matter. Bullinger also claims that the laying on of hands [for the transmission of the Holy Spirit] testified in the Acts of the Apostles was a special provision that only existed at the beginning [of the proclamation] of the Gospel. Calvin could use this argument against Bullinger. If [the Holy Spirit] was offered in a temporary sacrament, how much more does an offering always take place in a perpetual sacrament! Of course, Calvin knows that the gift of the Spirit was not dependent on the laying on of hands, that the sign could be ineffective, and that God also granted his grace without the sign.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] It is also not very helpful when Bullinger emphasizes in dispute that the signified (res [signata]) is not synchronous with the sign. It is known that in baptism, for example, renewal of life, which is offered through this sign, does not occur suddenly but only gradually. Moreover, when Bullinger emphasizes so much that only God is the author of all that is attributed to the sacraments, one can conclude that he would say: Since God grants enlightenment and imparts wisdom, God's law [or word] does not confer these gifts! Bullinger excludes the signs (excludere) because, in his view, man becomes a partaker of heavenly gifts through faith. Calvin replies: If these gifts are bestowed on man through faith, then they are also bestowed on him through the sacraments, since faith comes from God's word and the sacraments! Who doubts, by the way, that the saints received several gifts even before their participation in the sacraments? However, it sounds as if Bullinger believes that the saints are already so filled with God's gifts that they receive nothing additional with the sacraments! Bullinger asserts that the [Ethiopian eunuch] already believed with all his heart before his baptism and was therefore already [newly] created by God before his baptism. That is true. But if Bullinger concludes from this that baptism offered the eunuch nothing he did not already have, he is mistaken! For even if he already believed with all his heart, he still lacked much. The episode of [the Roman centurion] Cornelius does not help Bullinger out of the predicament either. He should rather ensure that the arguments he uses do not harm his doctrine! It is untenable when Bullinger concludes from [Paul's] exhortation to examine his faith before participating in the Lord's Supper that Christ offers nothing in the Lord's Supper. This would only be true if the participant in the Lord's Supper already possessed the whole Christ within himself. The Lord's Supper serves to enjoy Christ more fully. Calvin is therefore surprised that Bullinger excludes a completion of what is offered! The example of Abraham, whom God justified before he was circumcised, cited by Bullinger, is not applicable. For when Paul writes in this context that Abraham's justification was sealed by circumcision, he indicates that there was a progression in Abraham's justification experience. The sign allowed Abraham to enjoy more of the justification [offered to him by God]; this, of course, only because he believed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] [Calvin and the like-minded] think like Bullinger that the sacraments are instruments (instrumenta). However, Bullinger denies that God, as the sole offerer, nevertheless offers something through the signs and through his servants (ministri). Therefore, Bullinger believes he is entitled not only to admonish [Calvin and the like-minded] but also to attack them harshly. In doing so, he not only disparages Calvin (who could not teach otherwise with a clear conscience) but also all who share his view! He accuses them of wanting to establish a tyranny [in the church]. By referring them to Scripture, he also gives the impression that they are teaching falsely. However, Scripture shows that God's servants renew people, draw their hearts to God, and can forgive their sins. Bullinger may interpret these texts a hundred times back and forth: He will not get around the fact that God, the source of all things, works through his servants as through instruments! Why else would the church be called the mother of all the devout? Not because God renews people through the service rendered by the church? Or does Bullinger want to accuse Paul of tyranny because he announced that a grace was conferred on Timothy through his laying on of hands? What Calvin recently said to the pastors of Bern, he wants to repeat here: The Spirit makes two statements about God's servants. On the one hand, he emphasizes that they can do nothing by themselves. So one reads: "Therefore, neither the one who plants nor...," etc. In themselves, God's servants are nothing. On the other hand, the Spirit attributes his efficacy (efficacia) to them, so that they receive great praise (which, however, should not go to their heads). Thus, Paul does not distinguish in 2 Corinthians 3, [1f], between his work and that of the Holy Spirit. But immediately afterwards, he makes the previously mentioned confession: "Therefore, neither...". Bullinger writes: God used (utari) Peter to convert Cornelius. So God needed (Dei opus fuisse) Peter's performance. What Bullinger acknowledges here in connection with Cornelius' conversion, Calvin extends. Why quarrel any longer?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] [In summary:] If one believes that God offers his grace in the sacraments, one is not therefore a Pharisee who trusts in his achievements, especially since the sacraments are not human works! Far too often, Bullinger draws such illogical conclusions. So also when he claims that grace and faith are not offered in the sacraments because God accomplishes this through his Spirit in our hearts. Do not faith (Romans 10, [14f]) and the Holy Spirit (Galatians [3, 5]) arise from the preaching of the Gospel? And is God's word, which leads to faith, not engraved in the sacraments? Therefore, it is not wrong to claim that God accomplishes through the sacraments what he accomplishes through faith and the Spirit, or that the sacraments, just like the Holy Spirit, are seals of our spiritual legacy. This also applies to the church [and its servants]. Bullinger's mistake is that he opposes the subordinate [the sacrament or God's servants] to the superior [faith or the Spirit]. If someone were to deny that man is nourished by the work of his hands because he is fundamentally nourished by God's blessing, one would reply that the two statements are not mutually exclusive. It is important that God's blessing is given priority and the work of the hands is considered a means. Every time Bullinger mentions the Spirit, Calvin responds in accordance with Scripture that this does not exclude the sacraments as instruments of the Spirit, which are, of course, only effective because the latter animates them. At the end of chapter [11], Bullinger argues that if Christ were indeed to offer himself to man in the sacrament, there could be no relationship (communicatio) between Christ and man before his participation in the sacrament! Again, Calvin must say that this argument is wrong. Moreover, Christ does not reveal himself completely to man the first time. Christ's revelation in the person in whom Christ already lives through faith develops parallel to that person's faith. Thus, the sacraments represent steps by which faith is promoted. Bullinger does not want to acknowledge that Christ ordered his disciples to eat his body (edere) when he commanded them to eat the bread. But he errs in this, because otherwise the eating in the Lord's Supper would be a mere comedy (histrionica actio). Of course, there is a figure of speech here, but one in which the inner truth contained is by no means destroyed by the visible sign. In this figure of speech, the external sign rather indicates that Christ's statement is true; that is, the soul is nourished (vescari) by Christ's flesh (caro) as our body is by the bread.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] These are the corrections that would need to be made for Calvin to fully agree with Bullinger's treatise. He has not mentioned the commendable aspects of the writing here, as Bullinger had asked him to communicate the deficiencies. Now that he has fulfilled this task as a friend, he hopes that Bullinger will not take offense at his openness and sincerity.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] In Bern, he encountered a very unpleasant situation that Bullinger would not have been prepared for (but he was). Therefore, he could not follow Bullinger's advice (he would have done so otherwise, even if he did not like this advice, especially since he believes that such wounds cannot heal by covering them up - tegendo). Bullinger will want to know what he did then? The answer is: Nothing! He could only listen to the heated complaints of both parties. This is the peace that Bullinger has heard about through his friends! May the Lord have mercy on this church, which is to be pitied as long as its pastors quarrel in this way.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] Greetings. When reading this letter, Bullinger should always remember Augustine's statement, who noted that the sacraments are performed by humans, but accomplish divine things, even if human things [like eating and drinking] take place on earth. Calvin and his colleagues also greet Bullinger's fellow ministers, especially Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, and Johannes [Wolf]. May the Lord guide the people of Zurich and bless their work!</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, most esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I read your book as soon as I returned home. I will faithfully keep the silence you requested from me until the end. Do not doubt it. I hope that the judgment I submit here will be pleasing to you. I would indeed very much like us to come to a complete agreement at some point. If not, I ask that you consider my freedom in a good light, if I did this without your command. However, since I do not doubt that you are convinced that I am your friend, it would be in your kindness to accept what you know comes from a sincere heart. Now, since I have been led here by no other motive than the desire to serve you, I trust that my duty will be more pleasing to you than a cause of offense. However, I briefly touched on each chapter, because I considered it superfluous to engage with you in long arguments. Therefore, I do not want you to think that I am dealing with you precisely, as if with a censorious style, but rather attribute it to familiarity, that I am content to point out with a finger what I desire. I do not dispute with you further, but only advise you to weigh the matter with your own judgment according to your prudence.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>1. In the first chapter, I noticed the flaw that you oppose the divisions of signs, indeed various but still rightly agreeing, as if they were contrary to each other.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>2. In the second chapter, I do not like that you make the word sacrament a military term. I certainly admit that baptism and the sacred supper have something that corresponds to military sacraments. But you seek the etymology that the first authors of this word considered. However, I see that from the very beginning of the church, the Latins called sacraments what the Greeks called μυστήρια. For even the old interpreter often used it in this sense, both in the Old and New Testaments. And hardly any other word is more used by other writers. Therefore, I place it beyond controversy that sacraments were once called as if mysteries.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>3. In the third chapter, you transfer the place of Paul: "All these things happened to them as examples" [1Cor 10:6, 11], to another meaning than the apostle's mind bears.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>4. In the fifth chapter, it is true in some sense what you say, that God never promises to be corporally present with the signs. However, I would wish it to be said a little more clearly. For certainly the Lord, when he ascended the ladder, presented himself to be seen by our father Jacob under a corporeal figure. And examples of this kind are found everywhere.</p>
      <p>What you immediately add about symbolic expressions, I would prefer to be deferred to its own place: lest it be twice in the same.</p>
      <p>The argument you use there has no weight with me. You deny that these words of the Lord: "Do this in remembrance of me" [Lk 22:19; 1Cor 24f], allow us to establish the real presence of those things we must remember. I accept the same as true. For what else is the thing than the truth? I say that the memory of a present thing is in the supper. But memory is of absent things. Nor does it contradict. For Christ is absent from the supper as far as the eyes, as far as all the senses of the body, as far as place. For his body is in heaven. The supper is performed on earth. A long distance. But he is present to pious minds by the power of his spirit, because Christ's distance does not prevent him from wonderfully feeding his own. The same is the reason for that place of Paul: "Celebrate the death until he comes" [1Cor 11:26]. For Christ does not descend to us from heaven, nor is he seen with the eyes, but he is present to us only by faith. Therefore, his spiritual union with us does not contradict his final coming. Nor does anything prevent him from being essentially, that is, truly himself, offered to us, and yet expected to come until the day of resurrection, because he remains in heaven.</p>
      <p>Somewhat later, where you rebuke those who understand heaven not as a place but as a condition, although I agree with you in the matter itself, I would still wish to deal more gently with them.</p>
      <p>At the end of the chapter, not everyone will concede to you that the Lord said his flesh, eaten corporally, is of no profit, unless you explain corporally: in a corporeal manner. But this does not support you in the cause you are handling. For many who assert real eating do not assert carnal eating.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>In the sixth chapter, where you deny that the word blessing is ever taken for consecration, I disagree with you. For when Paul writes: "The cup of blessing which we bless" [1Cor 10:16], this syntax does not agree with thanksgiving. And certainly, the symbols are sanctified when they are destined for their proper use according to Christ's institution. Which you also admit.</p>
      <p>In the same chapter, in my judgment, you too much diminish the power of the external word. Although I do not disapprove of the argument you explain. Only in the diminution do you seem to me excessive.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>In the eighth chapter, the definition of the union you set between the sign and the signified does not completely satisfy me. In the exceptions, which exclude crude opinions and whatever is superstition, I will gladly subscribe to you. But at the same time, I would wish it to be more fully demonstrated how God is truthful in providing what he figures. When you intend to do this, you propose an analogy in place of union. But it is much more. Namely, the truth and complement of the analogy. Just as in baptism there is an analogy of purification between Christ's blood and water, of mortification again and newness of life between Christ's death and resurrection and the temporary submersion. Union is the complement of the figured thing: By which it happens that the sign is not empty, because the Lord, what he represents by the sign, at the same time accomplishes and fulfills in us by the power of his spirit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>In the supper, there is the analogy you describe between the bread and the body of Christ, between the blood and the wine. Union is our spiritual conjunction with Christ, by which it happens that our souls are truly nourished by him. This is the reason why your definition seems too meager to me. But this whole thing depends on the offering, which we will soon see.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>In the same chapter, I am somewhat offended that you simply compare the metonymy that is in the sacraments to profane images. Nor do I deny that there is some similarity. But at the same time, the diversity and degrees should have been noted. For where is the spirit in the image of Caesar, which in some way animates it, so that it is effective in our hearts? I know many good men have abhorred Zwingli's doctrine because this comparison occurred so often without correction. For from this they concluded that the supper was made a theatrical spectacle. And among these is also Philipp Melanchthon.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>In the tenth chapter, where you dispute about the name of grace, a metonymic meaning should be added, that it is transferred to free gifts, because they are effects of grace.</p>
      <p>A little later, I do not like that you are so rigid in explaining the word confer. You know it must always be avoided that the adversary justly complains that what he said in a healthier or more tolerable sense was distorted by calumny. Moreover, those who teach that the sacraments confer grace do not understand this to mean giving righteousness or something similar, but administering God's graces to us. And this is the sense in which Fabius says: Birds feed their chicks with their beak. Therefore, I would wish the place to be mitigated, lest in the ardor of rebuke you seem to have seized what was less odious. Indeed, what is absurd in this sentence, that the sacraments are aids to perceive God's grace? You will object, this is less than confer. I concede. But you will add the grace of the spirit, which is the soul of the sacraments: Then it will be entirely true that grace is conferred by the sacraments. But the expression is harsher. Therefore, either it is enough to abstain from it, or it is softened by a sound interpretation.</p>
      <p>In the same chapter, I do not find a reason to so greatly exaggerate the place of Bonaventura. You say, those lacking God's grace are inconsiderately referred to the sacraments. How so? Since God has ordained these aids for us, by which we are directed to him? But God does not transfer his glory to the elements. I admit. But is this to transfer God's glory to creatures, when he uses them as instruments to distribute his grace? Therefore, let the sun not illuminate the earth, therefore let bread not nourish. Again, you object: God calls us to himself, he does not send us away to the sacraments. As if the sacraments keep us in themselves, and do not rather lead us by the hand to Christ. In this, the Papists are sacrilegious, because they make the sacraments impediments so that pious souls do not come directly to Christ, to draw from that one source whatever is good.</p>
      <p>At the end of the chapter, you conclude thus: Whoever believes in Christ is justified by his faith before he communicates with the sacraments: Therefore, it is clear that grace is not conferred by the sacraments. But with me, the contrary argument prevails: Because we are justified by faith, therefore grace is conferred on us by the sacraments, because they are exercises of faith, which to that extent enrich us with spiritual gifts, and thus make us partakers of Christ, as they promote our faith. You will ask, from the old man, or by themselves? By no means. But as they serve faith, and through them the spirit of Christ effectively acts in the elect, without which the thing is dead and the sacrament useless.</p>

      <p>In the eleventh chapter, I was very surprised that not only is the offering of things denied by you, but it is also sharply vexed. You accept the word itself from the Thomists. But where, I ask, will God's truth be when the offering is removed? Christ, by handing me the bread and wine, promises me his body and blood. I receive the sign. You deny that the thing is given to me at the same time. Is this not a mockery? For to offer in this place is nothing else to me than to give for enjoyment. You will deny that this applies to the sacrament because it is proper to God. I will not fight with you about that, because I attribute nothing more to the sacrament than that it is God's instrument, and indeed of no efficacy, except what it borrows from the spirit of God. But you say: The sacraments do not contain God's grace, therefore they do not offer it. This consequence is not valid. Although I do not concede to you that God's grace is not contained in the sacraments as to dispensation, when I speak thus I do not mean it is included, but as we are accustomed to say, Christ is contained in the gospel. For certainly, Christ is offered to us through the gospel, or that saying of Paul will be false: That the Corinthians came into his communion through the gospel. In this way, no mist is cast over my eyes, so that I do not clearly distinguish what should not be confused.</p>

      <p>However, you desire scriptural passages by which this is proven. I answer, if we admit your solutions, nothing will be proven from the scriptures. For when Paul says that the church is cleansed by the washing of water in the word of life, you allege it is a symbolic expression. From this, you conclude, therefore the water is a sign. I willingly concede both to you, I also profess both with you. But you are not yet as free as you think. For the symbol will be empty and deceptive, unless it is a true pledge of the cleansing it figures, a true seal, both of which require offering.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>The reasoning of others is similar. Therefore, let me be brief, passing over other examples, I will take that one: This is my body which is given for you. You contend that the bread is a sign. We feel the same. You deny the offering. I, on the other hand, assert it. You think the knot is explained in the figure. I do not admit it. For a sign from God does not proceed empty. Nor does the bread only figure that Christ's body was once sacrificed for me, but it is given to me today as food to eat. For these words must be religiously weighed: Take, eat. Hence also Paul calls it communion. Nor am I unaware of how this word is twisted. But I do not care for sophistries. Certainly, the true representation of the supper will not be, unless we become partakers of Christ, in which the offering of the figured thing is.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>I come to other places that are not about baptism or the supper. You deny that the Holy Spirit was with the breath when Christ breathed on the apostles. Why so? Because, you say, it is not circumscribed. But not even the Papists assert circumscription. And yet I reject and condemn their sophistries. I, who join the spirit with the breath, do not imagine a conjunction of place, but only that the truth of the sign is established. That is, let us not think the gesture was empty and of no value, but that by which Christ represented before the eyes what he was doing inwardly by secret power. And I establish this distinction between signs divinely and humanly instituted. For man can devise many signs that decently figure something, but without the thing. God alone is the one who accomplishes by his spirit what he figures by the symbol. Similarly, the dove was the spirit. Which you deny in such a way that you seem to me to admit. For you say it is the testimony of presence. And what more do I ask? For when you expressly avoid that anyone thinks the dove was substantially the spirit, in that you have me as an adherent. It is enough for me that the Holy Spirit, by exhibiting the symbol of the dove, exhibited himself as present. The one cannot be without the other. What you add otherwise is of little relevance.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>About the laying on of hands, that response is cold, that it was a certain privilege in the glory of the rising gospel. Indeed, I also retort this antistrophe on you. If in temporary sacraments there was the offering of the thing, at the time when the legitimate use still lasted, therefore in perpetual signs there is the perpetual offering of the thing. What you deny, that the spirit was bound to the laying on of hands, all will concede to you, with whom you have this chapter's contest. For the sign could sometimes be without the thing. And it was free for God to impart grace to whom he wished without the intercession of the sign.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>What you raise about time, because the thing does not always appear with the sign at the same moment, is weak. For I concede to you that the offering is made at different times. As the renewal of life, which God offers in baptism, is not immediately at hand, as if it were included under the water, but gradually proceeds from God.</p>
      <p>What you allege, that God alone is the author of all that we ascribe to the sacraments, is as if you were to say: God alone illuminates, God alone gives wisdom, therefore the law of God confers none of these. For what do we abrogate or derogate from God when we hand over that he acts through his instruments, and indeed alone? Add that there is no more valid argument by which I can convince you than that by which you try to escape. For you exclude the signs, because we become partakers of heavenly gifts through faith, but I, on the contrary: If through faith, therefore also through the sacraments. For faith is from the word and the sacraments. About which I will speak again.</p>
      <p>But you bring up, that the saints were often in possession of things before they participated in the sacraments. Who denies it? But meanwhile, will you say they were so full that nothing was added from the sacraments? You say, the eunuch believed with all his heart, therefore he was born of God, he had God dwelling in him, he lived in God, he had passed from death to life. So far I agree with you. But when you infer, baptism did not offer him what he had before, in that you are mistaken, in that you attribute to him the fullness of these things, which I say were more abundantly received by him with the help of baptism. For he certainly believed with all his heart, but much was still lacking in his faith. For sincere faith can be, which will nevertheless be only begun. The example of Cornelius does not help you any more. You see I do not evade in these solutions. Therefore, see that you do not rely on arguments that do not harm the doctrine you attack.</p>
      <p>It is no more solid what you reason about the supper: We are forbidden to approach the supper, unless after examination. He who examines himself has faith. Therefore, before anyone approaches the supper, he is grafted into Christ. Therefore, Christ is not offered in the supper. This would indeed be true, if he who prepares himself for the supper possessed the whole Christ. But what is the use of the supper, unless that we may enjoy Christ more fully? that he may grow in us? that we may draw more abundantly from his spirit?</p>
      <p>But this very thing, which I wonder at more vehemently, you reject, that what was given in part is more fully offered. Nor does the apostle support you in this when he teaches that Abraham was justified in uncircumcision, so that circumcision added nothing to his righteousness. Certainly, the work of circumcision added nothing, but I will draw from Paul's words, that God's grace was more fully offered to Abraham, as he made greater progress in faith. For he adds, circumcision was in the place of a seal. For what purpose? to seal the righteousness of faith. If circumcision seals Abraham's righteousness, then it increases and confirms his faith. From which I conclude that it also makes him enjoy his righteousness more fully. Namely, according to the measure of his faith. Nor do we therefore imagine that a man is more fully justified by signs. For the cause of justification is not disputed here, but about the offering that is made to pious consciences. We contend that it is made by the word and sacraments. You bring nothing that contradicts.</p>
      <p>Nor do we think otherwise than that the sacraments are instruments, which does not escape you. For you specifically attack what we say, that God alone properly offers, but through signs and through his ministers. And not content with simple reproof, you inveigh against us somewhat more harshly than was fitting for your modesty. Perhaps it did not occur to you, by these sinister suspicions, whose envy burdens our doctrine, to touch me. But what then? Yet your speech tends to this and means that whoever teaches what my conscience compels me to teach should bear the mark of this infamy, as if he aspired to tyranny over souls.</p>
      <p>When you refer us to scripture, in my judgment, you achieve that all may see that it is handed down in the scriptures what you claim is falsely and dangerously asserted by us. The scriptures testify that ministers regenerate men, turn hearts to God, remit sins. Though you revolve such places a hundred times, no more right or convenient interpretation will be found: That God, whose this whole is, acts through his ministers as through instruments. For why else is the church called the mother of all the pious, unless because God regenerates us by its ministry? Why does a minister dare to call himself the father of the church he presides over, unless because God uses his work? Will Paul be suspected of aspiring to tyranny because he preaches that grace was conferred on Timothy through the laying on of his hands? Here certainly Paul does not transfer to himself what he has taken from God. For he makes God the author of the gift, himself only the minister.</p>
      <p>What I recently said to the ministers of the Bernese church, I now repeat to you, the spirit speaks in two ways about ministers. Now he considers what they are worth by themselves, and then he strips them of all power. Hence that: He who plants is nothing, etc. Therefore, the minister apart from God will be nothing. Now he joins his efficacy with their ministry, and thus adorns them with splendid praises, with which, however, no one should be proud as if he were something. Both are clearly expressed in the third chapter of the second to the Corinthians, where Paul magnificently extols his apostleship, because he does not separate himself from the spirit of God, but rather (as he speaks elsewhere) preaches the power of God in himself and his preaching effective. Although, when you have said everything, you finally come back to this, that you also subscribe to us. These are your words: God uses Peter's work in converting Cornelius, so that Peter's work is also God's work. Thus Peter is a co-worker. What you admit about conversion, I extend to all other things. Why then do we quarrel in vain? After it is agreed that God alone both begins and perfects our salvation, but through men, I have what I wanted: your words contain and mean the same as what you attack in us.</p>
      <p>What you object about Pharisaic trust in works, if we accept that grace is offered in the sacraments, does not apply against us. For the sacraments should not be considered human works, properly speaking. I, when I approach the supper, bring nothing of my own, but offer myself to Christ to be fed. Thus here no work will come into account, because it is solely about the dispensation of God's grace.</p>
      <p>What I touched on above, I must also repeat here. For you often fall back on that fallacy. If God insinuates himself into our hearts and offers through the spirit and faith, not therefore through the sacraments. But whence, I ask, faith? Is it not from the hearing of faith? Whence the spirit? Is it not from the preaching of the gospel? For Paul testifies to both. You know that the latter is found in Galatians, the former is taken from the tenth to the Romans. But the same reason applies to the word and sacraments. For the word of faith is inscribed in the sacraments. Therefore, it is not wrong to claim that God does through the sacraments what he does through faith, or that the sacraments, just like the Holy Spirit, are seals of our spiritual inheritance. Give pardon: this is the cause of error, that you do not consider that what is subordinated is not contrary. In which order are the labor of hands and God's blessing, even as to bodily life. Now if anyone denies that man is fed by the labor of hands because he is fed by God's blessing, will not the response be easy, that these two agree well, provided God's blessing holds the first place, indeed the whole power remains with it, the labor of hands is considered an instrumental cause? Therefore, whenever you mention the spirit, let this be your response, that nothing that scripture claims for it prevents the sacraments from being its instruments, dead and useless, unless as far as it animates them.</p>
      <p>You indeed sweat much in this, lest you seem to make them empty. But I warn you that you will not satisfy many whose judgment you do not despise.</p>
      <p>In the same chapter towards the end, when you reason that there will be no communication of Christ before the sacraments, if he is offered to us through the sacraments, the consequence is bad: for Christ does not communicate himself to us entirely on the first day. For if Christ dwells in our hearts through faith, his communication also grows with the increase of faith. But the sacraments are the steps by which faith is promoted.</p>
      <p>You deny that Christ, by handing the bread, commanded that we eat his body. But I think this sense is implied in Christ's words. He commands us to eat the bread, which he calls his body. Will it not be a theatrical action, unless we eat the body? But there is a trope in the expression. I admit: but so that the inner truth is not destroyed by the visible sign, but rather the visible sign is a true testimony when it figures the thing. And this is the analogy, that the soul is fed by the flesh of Christ, just as the body is by the bread.</p>
      <p>You have what I would wish corrected in your book, so that it may be approved without exception. I do not mention what is to be praised. For I remember what parts you enjoined on me, to note for you what was less pleasing. Therefore, what is both learnedly treated, aptly brought forward, rightly arranged in its order, and elegantly and ornately exposed, I will praise with you, and also among others when necessary. I wanted to do what you asked of me. Now, because I have fulfilled the duty of a friend, both by serving you and by freely advising you, it remains that you attribute my freedom both to the desire to serve and to simplicity, and consider it in a good light. Which I trust you will do.</p>
      <p>In Bern, I found what you did not expect, but I did not want, yet I divined (if this is to be called divination, where the matter is almost discovered). Therefore, there was no place for your advice. Which otherwise I would have followed, even if it displeased. For such wounds, believe me, are not healed by covering. If you ask, what then did I do? Nothing! I was only forced to hear the bitter complaints on both sides. Therefore, the peace of which you were informed by friends. May the Lord regard that church, which is so long miserably torn by the dissensions of its pastors.</p>
