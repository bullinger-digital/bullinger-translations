      <p>Grace and peace of Christ, the savior of all. I would never have had such confidence or rather audacity, honorable Mr. Bullinger, to address you with my letters, although I relied much on your kindness and humanity, as I could truly attribute to you the praise that you are easy to forgive if anything was done against you either more confidently or even more impudently. Now, because another necessary reason for writing to you has arisen, I did not want to delay it any longer.</p>
      <p>Not many days have passed since my father-in-law, Mr. Musculus, was in Basel at the printer Hervagius for certain reasons. He ordered his son Abraham there to send me two copies of Genesis, recently printed by Hervagius, one of which I would send to you in Zurich. Since the journey from here to there is less frequent, I used the service of Mr. Peter Sartor, the pastor of Arburg, who, because he has a direct route to you, ensured that this book was transferred to you; for otherwise, it is a rare thing to find a reliable courier to whom you can safely entrust anything. I would like to ask you, honorable Mr. Bullinger, to let me know as soon as possible, if not by letter, then in any other way, whether you have received what I sent, not indeed as if I urge you to respond because I wrote, but so that I can be more at ease and more secure about the book being taken care of and be able to give my father-in-law, Mr. Musculus, some certain account. What remains, I will conclude this letter with a request, asking you to always have me recommended to you; I, in turn, offer myself most ready in all duties that befit a disciple. For I gladly acknowledge that I owe much to the people of Zurich, as I was a student and disciple of the Zurich school for some time. Besides these benefits, I confess that I am much indebted to you and your household; for at the beginning of learning to play the lute, your son Heinrich instructed me, Ludwig Lavater taught me dialectics, and Simlerus imbued me with the principles of arithmetic, which they call the mother of mathematics. Thus, indeed, I favor you and yours above others not without reason. Farewell, honorable Mr. Bullinger. Please greet your children and sons-in-law, Mr. Huldrich Zwingli, Lavater, and Simler, in my name. Zofingen, 1554, the day before the calends of November.</p>
      <p>Valentin Rebmann, entirely devoted to you. To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
