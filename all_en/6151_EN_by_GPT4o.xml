      <p>Greetings. Yesterday evening I received your letters, brother, and those of the most honorable lord ambassador; but I solemnly assure you that, due to business, I have not yet been able to read those lengthy letters of his.</p>
      <p>But as soon as I can free myself a little, I will read them most diligently. Meanwhile, however, while I am busy, I have handed them over to my Gwalther to read.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I earnestly beg you to excuse me to the most honorable man for not replying; I will write when the opportunity arises, and indeed as soon as I can. I have nothing to respond to your letters.</p>
      <p>Hannibal's expedition is proceeding slowly, and some think it will not proceed at all; for the German princes do not want their men to serve under foreign leaders; and the Emperor has forbidden his men to serve any foreign prince by imperial command.</p>
      <p>It is said, therefore, that they are rushing to the Emperor by arranged horses to obtain permission to withdraw the troops; however, rumor has it that the Emperor died this month.</p>
      <p>If this is true, many and various disturbances are feared by many, perhaps many disturbances of some will also be dissipated.</p>
      <p>[Our Confederates] do not cease to be, as they have been for many years, intolerably insolent. May the Lord restrain all those who desire war and console the afflicted.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 26, 1564.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you; greet the most honorable lord ambassador, the consuls, Gallicius, Pontasella, etc.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
