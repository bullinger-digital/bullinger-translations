    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Enzinas is terribly sorry that he has not come to Zurich either at Christmas or now with Johannes Herwagen. He would have so much liked to learn about the Zurich form of worship and to exchange ideas with them. Unfortunately, he is currently being prevented from doing so by trivial matters. If nothing unexpected happens, he hopes to undertake the planned journey in about 20 days.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Emperor Charles V is said to have risen from the dead and won unexpectedly. Perhaps this corresponds to God's plan, namely to let him fall even deeper after a victory; for Enzinas cannot believe that God will deliver his church to this tyrant. Surely, he now wants to chastise his own.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Enzinas wonders whether the Swiss are acting wisely if they continue to do nothing in these dangerous times, which are even more threatening for them than for the German Protestants. Furthermore, the Emperor will be able to seize each [place] much more easily than if all [places] stood together. Consequently, it would be quite unreasonable if some [places] went into battle alone because the others do not want to help them. But what can human help do? Victory comes from heaven.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Duke Maurice of Saxony is said to have been defeated by the Danish King Christian III and the Hanseatic cities. If only this were true! Do the people of Zurich know anything about this?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Enzinas has enclosed a book [...] for Hieronymus Sailer in the shipment intended for Christoph Froschauer by the Basel bookseller Heinrich Petri. As soon as Bullinger receives this, he should forward it to Sailer. The same applies to the letter. Enzinas will reimburse Bullinger for all the expenses incurred, even with interest.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings to Konrad Pellikan and Theodor Bibliander, to whom Enzinas wishes a good new year. He also wishes Bullinger and his family all the best.</p>

      <p>S. D. I am terribly sorry that I could not come to you for the Christmas festival nor now with Herwagen. Otherwise, nothing would have been more pleasing to me than to see your ecclesiastical rites and to enjoy your company. But, hindered by matters of not so great importance, I could not come. Once I have freed myself from this millstone, which I hope will happen within twenty days, I will undoubtedly come, unless something else divinely intervenes in the meantime.</p>

      <p>I hear that the Emperor has revived and is congratulating himself on that desired and unexpected victory; it is easy to conquer those who do not resist. Perhaps God wants to place him in a certain high degree of dignity, so that he may finally be cast down from a higher place, but I will never believe that God wants to deliver his church to this tyrant to be torn apart. Meanwhile, we are being severely chastised, which I wish may turn to our salvation, as it usually happens to those who truly believe in God.</p>

      <p>Moreover, in such great public danger, I do not know whether it seems wise for the Swiss to have acted, that in such a great cause, in which they themselves are sought no less or even more than the other professors of the gospel, they have not yet moved, nor do I know whether anything certain is to be expected from them. The Emperor will more easily break individuals than those united, and it is to be feared that those who did not want to fight with others will be forced to fight alone. I see that there is no human aid. Victory must be hoped for from heaven, nor should there be any doubt that it will be present to those who invoke with true faith even in the most afflicted matters.</p>

      <p>We have heard that Maurice has been routed and put to flight by the King of Denmark and the maritime cities. If only it were true! If you have anything that could relieve us of some trouble, share it with us.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>In the package of books from the bookseller Heinrich Petri, I sent a book to Sailer to your printer; I ask that, as soon as you receive it, you order it to be forwarded to him, and send letters by the first messenger. Whatever expenses or labors are imposed in such matters, I will repay all even with interest.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Greet on my behalf Father Pellikan, Theodor, and the other brothers, to whom you will wish a happy beginning of this year. I wish you and your whole family all good things.</p>
      <p>Farewell, on the first day of the year 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours, Francisco Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
