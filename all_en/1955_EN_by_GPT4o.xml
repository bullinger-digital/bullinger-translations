      <p>S. D. Your letters were delivered to me by Mr. a Monte. I give you the greatest thanks for your brotherly advice. May the Lord make it successful in my hands and grant the spirit and grace to act.</p>
      <p>Would that Musculus had been sent for me or at least with me; but neither happened nor is it to be hoped for. His wife is gravely ill; she has suffered a hemorrhage, then a severe headache attacked her so intensely that all her senses are disturbed, so I greatly fear for her life. Now she also suffers from diarrhea, which is more dangerous at no other time of the year than this. May the Lord restore her, I pray, having mercy on the good old man, with whom it would go badly if she were to pass away. I hope the Lord will hear our prayers. Tomorrow we will depart from here. There is one thing by which we can suppress many; for we have been given, which has never happened before, full authority to act with them, even with imprisonments or banishments, if the situation demands it, which will break the recklessness of many who see that so much power has been granted to us. When I return, I will write everything to you. The letters, about which I wrote recently, that I received them from Lausanne to send to you, were left here, as you suspected, with the others; however, I sent them in the meantime through a certain tailor to my brother, from whom I now think you have received them. As for what you wish to know, what... that Tobias did, briefly have this: Musculus and I had taken him into our house, and we also recommended him to the council, relying so much on the testimonies of so many men that it was almost decided that he would be received here and assigned to some manual craft; but the decision prevailed that he should be dismissed with a florin given to him.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, while he was here, he did not return to our house for several nights, pretending the next day that he had gone somewhere, although we later learned that he had hidden with certain prostitutes. When he came to Freiburg, he stayed with a Jew who is there and stole something from him, then fled to a village near our city. The Jew pursued him but did not find him. Meanwhile, I was informed of all these matters and sent someone to this village to search for him and to take back your letters and mine, which I had given him for Viret, lest, if he were caught, your names along with mine would be exposed to the mockery of malevolent people. This person found him very astonished and unable to conceal his crime; he therefore took my letters and yours from him. I will now take your letters, sent to Beza, with me to him. The testimony you gave him I now return to you. If I have done anything wrong in this matter against you, forgive me; certainly, what I did, I did out of zeal for your name, with which I am rightly affected, and I would wish the same to be done for me by you in such a case. Where he has now fled, I do not know, and now he will hardly escape. This is written hastily to your letters; I prepare myself for the journey, which may the Lord make successful. There is nothing new, except that a rumor still vaguely circulates about a great conflict in Picardy and that many Swiss have fallen, yet victory was obtained by them.</p>
      <p>But it is not certain; we will soon learn something. May the Lord be with you. All of mine greet you and yours. Given on August 12, 1553. Bern.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his lord and compatriot, to be piously honored.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
