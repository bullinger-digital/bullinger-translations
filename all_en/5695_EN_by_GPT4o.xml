      <p>S. D. I am sending you what I have received from friends in Italy at present.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Salisbury writes from England that all things are going quite well and that Scotland is making great progress in the Gospel, with the Queen, according to her Guise nature, attending mass alone.</p>
      <p>The court preacher of the Duke of Prussia, sent by his prince, conferred with Brenz about the supper; but they could not agree.</p>
      <p>Brenz, with his Schmidelin, is fabricating monstrous opinions.</p>
      <p>Here, the one otherwise known as Jacob Andreae, mentioned you, and indeed not without contempt.</p>
      <p>However, I have informed Weygel, for that is what the preacher is called, about everything, so that he now thinks more rightly of you.</p>
      <p>The followers of Brenz are astonishing; they uphold the most absurd doctrines.</p>
      <p>And today the Palatine is in very bad repute among them and is called a Calvinist by them.</p>
      <p>However, I hope that despite all these unwilling ones, he will persevere in the truth.</p>
      <p>A new war has arisen between the Swede and the King of Denmark.</p>
      <p>Perhaps a grave war will arise in Italy because of Milan, which is said to be thought of by the Spaniards to be taken by King Maximilian.</p>
      <p>There is a strange disturbance and altercation in Poland concerning the cause of the Trinity and the cause of Blandrata and Stancaro.</p>
      <p>Soon I will send you some writings again; we are wonderfully vexed by these.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently with all the brothers and fellow ministers. All mine and all the brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>I wrote in great haste. April 20, 1563.</p>
      <p>We greatly wonder what is happening in France, whether peace has been accepted or rejected.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>May Lord Jonville be safe.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I ask you to return this writing, which I am sending to you, promptly; I have no copy.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord John Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Geneva, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
