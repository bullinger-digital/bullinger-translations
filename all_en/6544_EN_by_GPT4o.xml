      <p>Greetings. In the meantime, I met with the envoy.</p>
      <p>He showed letters that were written by Captain Fleckenstein from Lucerne, Milan, on September 22, in which it was stated: It was announced in Milan that Gorsia, the admiral of Spain, had defeated the Turks and expelled them from the entire island; Cardinal Borromeo had come to Milan, a procession was held, a crosswalk (but it is not mentioned why)... If these things are true, Angusola will quickly spread it throughout all of Switzerland. Bartholomew, the bishop, was received with great applause in the communities that are in Tuml√§sch. I discussed many things with the envoy about these matters; we agreed on this: the plague will keep the people of the Five Cantons at home. The envoy wishes to have from you a copy of that new treaty of the Five Cantons.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor that Uri was set on fire in four places at once, but it was extinguished again.</p>
