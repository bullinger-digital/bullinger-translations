      <p>Greetings in the Lord Jesus.</p>
      <p>Hercules sends you his regards and has asked me to inform you of recent events in Italy. There is a certain fortress, or as the Italians say, an impregnable stronghold, situated between Reggio and Modena, which are towns of the Duke of Ferrara. The Duke has always wanted it to be guarded with the utmost care. It is located about twenty German miles from Milan. The Duke of Florence, with the consent of the Pope, since he is also from the Medici family, captured this fortress with the greatest astonishment of all through treachery by the one who was in charge of that place.</p>
      <p>Hercules, who is experienced in war, indicates that this event will be the cause of great upheavals in Italy; for it will be a great detriment to the Venetians, who are allied with the Duke of Ferrara, not to mention the Duke himself. For it will be easy to attack and capture Reggio and Modena by the enemies.</p>
      <p>You know that the Duke pays a large tribute to the Pope annually for these cities. If these two towns were captured, great dangers would threaten the Venetians.</p>
      <p>Hercules estimates that this was done with the consent of Philip, the King of Spain, who is hostile to the Venetians, a reward indeed worthy of the Cardinal of Ferrara, who supports the Antichrist's cause in France. In recent days, several thousand armed men in the name of the Pope, who were to be sent to Avignon, left Milan, where they had gathered, heading towards Bologna. Some said they had taken the route towards the sea. We now see what the foxes have schemed.</p>
      <p>We wanted you to know this.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, August 4, 1562.</p>

      <p>At the same time, H. Balinket also wrote from Bergamo and named the fortress, namely Rubiera. Soon other writings also came from there, saying it should not be, and that the Pope's troops are moving towards Genoa. In wars, there are many falsehoods; but it is strange who spreads such rumors or for what purpose.</p>
      <p>All who come from Italy consistently affirm that Rubiera was captured through treachery. Now, what is true and what is false is difficult to say.</p>
