      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Hear these things, which must be kept in utmost silence. Here is Petrus Dathenus, a very learned man, sent to us by the most illustrious Elector Palatine; but he absolutely does not want it to be known that he was sent by him. Sulcerus from Bern is said to have discovered what was previously written from Heidelberg regarding the matter of the confession. He then wrote these things to Brentz. Here in Augsburg, he objected to him, etc. The people of Württemberg and Zweibrücken are entirely focused on oppressing the Elector, and the Erfurt assembly is established for the purpose of setting the princes against each other. These are the plans of men. But God lives, the governor of all and the liberator and comforter of the afflicted. Farewell with yours.</p>
