    <p xml:id="regest1">From Bullinger's letter [No. 1029], it is inferred that Heinrich Wiederkehr in Zurich has slandered him; therefore, he truthfully describes the case as follows. He, Landvogt Schmid, had relieved [Untervogt] Wiederkehr from the task of arresting Rudolf Locher's son in Dietikon because he is related to him. However, Wiederkehr broke the confidentiality, as he himself admits, so that Locher, warned by Wiederkehr's wife, was able to escape before Schmid's envoys arrived; the claim by the wife that she had learned of the matter from Bernhard Tratz cannot be upheld. In the court session at the Wettingen Monastery, Wiederkehr and his father-in-law disputed the legitimacy of the court, repeatedly threatened to appeal to the governing authorities, and when fines were imposed for violating the confidentiality obligation—50 pounds for the Untervogt, 20 pounds for his wife—Wiederkehr reacted with insolent words. Nevertheless, Schmid, at the intercession of Bullinger and [Heinrich] Brennwald, is willing to remit 30 pounds, but expects the payment of the fines and court costs within 8 days; he requests that this also be communicated to Brennwald.</p>

      <p>My friendly, willing service, and whatever I can do for honor, love, and good, always before.</p>
      <p>Honorable, well-learned, especially gracious, dear sir and friend, your letter, recently sent to me, concerning your cousin Heinrich Wiederkehr, the innkeeper in Dietikon, I have understood its content and can well notice that he has slandered me against you and other my gracious lords and friends beside the truth, and if I were not burdened with other important affairs tomorrow, I would ride to you in Zurich myself and report the matter orally. However, since this is not possible for me, I want to report the matter to you as much as the pen can comprehend, with the truth.</p>
      <p>And it initially happened that when I was appointed by my gracious lords of Zurich to a Landvogt in Baden, I trusted and rejoiced in him and often stayed with him, thinking he would do the best for me above others. Then it happened that I was informed that Rudi Locher's son in Dietikon had broken the peace more than once with his hand, and since the Landvogt of Bern was there, he became a fugitive. But when I rode up, he returned home, and when I reported this, I ordered the mentioned Heini Wiederkehr, in the presence of only my Untervogt and scribe in Baden, to bring the peacebreaker to Baden in custody so that he would be punished for his misconduct. To this, he responded with a quick and sharp answer, saying I had nothing to command him, as he had not yet sworn to me, and if I were to have him arrested, it could become a bad affair and might turn out like in Schlieren, and I should handle the matter amicably; for Locher has a large kinship. And when I understood this and was affected by it, that he gave me such answers, I spoke with him: Should it be so that when an old Landvogt departs, the same oaths no longer apply, then my lords, the Confederates, would have to make a new one and give the Untervogts the oath again before a Landvogt takes the oaths. Furthermore, I heard well that if I wanted to punish someone for his misconduct, I would have to fear an uproar; I wanted to expect all this now and in the future. And again, by the oath he had given to the old Landvogt, I ordered him to take him into custody and bring him to Baden. And when he, as stated above, refused and finally understood my will and intention, and that he should tell me whether he would do it or not, he finally answered that he would not do it, as the mentioned Locher was related to him. And when I understood this from him and well thought he had first informed me of the kinship so that I had not commanded him anything, etc., and ordered him by his oath to keep it quiet and secret and tell no one about it, I would handle the matter differently. He promised me this, and so amicably parted from me.</p>
      <p>And when the next morning I sent my messenger to the sworn men in Dietikon and ordered them to take the named Locher into custody and deliver him to Baden, and when he arrived, he was warned in the evening or at night. And when Locher's father came to me and reported that his son had been warned and was gone, and asked me to do the best, I then summoned my Untervogt and scribe and inquired if such a warning came from them, and when they told me by their faith that it did not come from them, as they had not thought of it for anyone. Then I sent for the mentioned Heini Wiederkehr in custody and asked if such a warning came from him. He said no, and it could not be found by any honest man, and whoever said that of him was lying to him as a traitor and villain. And when I did not want to let him go and thought it had come from no one but him, he finally told me it was not so, as he came home in the evening around ten, he was sitting with his servant and day laborer along with the latter's wife, as they were eating, and among other words said: "The Landvogt is very angry with Rudi Locher's son, and if he does not reconcile with him, he will have a bad affair." Now he was warned from the speech, he did not know. And when I sent for the day laborer, also other acquaintances, his day laborer said he had heard such words from the innkeeper, but he had not warned Locher. But when he wanted to go to me, the innkeeper's wife said to him, she had warned him and would do it again whenever it happened. After that, the innkeeper's brother said in his presence that Locher came to him in his house early in the morning before daybreak, and a girl carried his clothes after him, and he was warned. Therefore, such a warning happened before and when my messenger came to Dietikon, and it could not come from anyone but from his, the innkeeper's, speech. Although the innkeeper's wife claims Bernhard Tratz heard it from the church path and told her, that is not true, as he was warned beforehand. You may summon Bernhard Tratz for this and interrogate him yourself. And since the mentioned Locher was warned by no one else but from the innkeeper's speech, also before and when my messenger arrived, etc., since then all Untervogts swear in their oaths to keep whatever is commanded to them by a Landvogt quiet and secret, so that injustice is justified and punished, and since I ordered him by his oath to keep it quiet and secret, and he promised me to do so. How he has kept such an oath and promise, you, the highly understanding, may judge for yourself whether I should leave him unpunished in terms of oaths and my office.</p>
      <p>And so I sent him and his wife amicably to the monastery of Wettingen (where I was to handle the matter of the preacher and mass priest of Dietikon) and wanted to impose a reasonable punishment on them for the above-mentioned affair. And when I began to speak amicably with them (for on my part there was no personal animosity or displeasure against him, I refer to God), he and his father-in-law, who the matter did not concern, before I had even finished speaking, became agitated and shouted, I should present the matter before honest people and not do it in secret. As I thought, what is done before me and my officials is not in secret, but just as it is handled before other authorities, also I have often been ordered to do justice for my lords in the eight places. As I might well endure my handling of the matter, if it had been customary before, etc. As he also spoke with sharp words, the child had a parent father and must become another vinegar from it, I cannot know what he meant by that. But I have acted as my office requires, and he should consider how he has kept his oath and the promise. But after all the handling, I imposed a fine of fifty pounds on him and twenty pounds on the woman. They should give it to me within eight days, unless he, the innkeeper, presents someone to me who warned Locher in the evening or at night; then I will handle the matter further as appropriate. He gave me such insolent words, as many honest people know well, that I have sufficient reason to act further against him and at least, if he were not in freedom, have him put back in custody and find out from whom the warning came or what kind of vinegar should come from it. But that we took or came in peace, that did not happen.</p>
      <p>But considering all this, in view of your and also Provost Brennwald's letter, to whom I am entirely inclined to comply in all matters that I can answer with honor, he shall also enjoy your intercession in this, and I will therefore remit thirty pounds on your behalf, and the remaining twenty pounds he shall pay me along with his wife's fine within eight days, satisfy me and pay along with the accrued costs, which are otherwise not large, or if this is not agreeable to him, I will present the matter to my gracious lords of the eight places council. If they then have a favor in it, or what they make of it, I will let it happen amicably. Hereby kindly asking, you will take this my long answer in the best way and also inform the lords Provost Brennwald, so that he will be informed. For where I can serve you, you will always find me willing. Herewith God protect you.</p>
      <p>Given on the 18th of August in the year etc. 37.</p>
      <p>Your willing Andreas Schmid, Landvogt in Baden in Aargau.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the city of Zurich, my gracious, dear lord and friend.</p>
