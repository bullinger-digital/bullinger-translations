      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Pierre Viret, faithful pastor of the church of Lausanne, most esteemed and beloved lord and brother, in Lausanne.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace to you from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>We finally received your letter, written on the 5th of the Kalends of December of the previous year at Vienne from the general assembly, around the Kalends of April of this year, which we wonder at; nor was it possible to respond immediately, both due to private and public affairs. Now at last, since some leisure has been granted to us, we devote this to our brief response, which we earnestly pray you will kindly accept from us.</p>
      <p>To you, Mr. Viret, most esteemed brother, we address this because you were the first to occupy a place in your public writing and because you can better explain our mind more fully to the remaining brothers whom it concerns.</p>
      <p>Your writing explains to many what the political custom of your churches has been since the restoration of the Gospel of Christ the Lord, of meeting and explaining the scriptures, finally praying and contributing to the aid of the poor. Nor did it lack the most abundant fruits until a certain Zebedee, seized by envy and ambition, made it infamous with slanders and importunate contentions, so that the most ample Bernese magistrate abolished it with the greatest detriment to the church. Where you severely accuse our fellow brothers, the ministers of the Bernese church, as those who suggested this plan to the magistrate without consulting you.</p>
      <p>It is especially painful that, encouraged by this example, either these or future generations seem likely to disturb all other synodal decrees at their own discretion.</p>
      <p>You therefore ask that, having understood your cause, we help you with our fellow brothers in Bern. When we read this, we were grieved in our hearts by this dissension or the appearance of dissension. For we know, as you do not ignore, how great in the church of Christ even from the smallest sparks, fires have often been kindled by Satan among the ministers of the church, either not sufficiently vigilant or not sufficiently instructed in charity, but somewhat more tenacious of their own purpose. Certainly, dearest brothers, we must beware lest the same happen to you, with Satan so diligently and shamelessly lying in wait for us. We certainly pray to God with continuous prayers for you and for the concord of the churches and ministers of God. And just as we have discussed some of this cause with our most beloved fellow brothers in Bern, so now with you, whom we venerate and love in the Lord, as most dear brothers, we will discuss these few things amicably.</p>
      <p>It indeed appears to us that the most ample senate of the Bernese republic did not make such a severe decree against your colloquies, as they were recently, without reasons. Nor do we see why you should be so greatly moved against our fellow brothers in Bern, who did not impede that decree of the magistrate. You have no doubt heard from them what moved them. What truly troubles you most, namely the fear that by this example either future generations or these same people, breaking through, will also proceed to disturb other salutary rites of the church with their decrees, seems to you to be least to be feared. For just as no ambitious prejudices or signs of severe tyranny have appeared to us in the decrees, words, and deeds of the leaders and ministers of the church, so in this very cause of the colloquies, it seems to you (unless we do not understand the matter) that as much has been given or returned to you as can be sufficient. For at the beginning, those colloquies are no longer restricted to the number four, but as often as it pleases, and as the church sees it as salutary, it is permitted to come together in assembly. Then a legitimate mode of discussing the scriptures is granted. For according to Paul's institution, two or three are ordered to speak, the rest to judge.</p>
      <p>The prophets themselves, I mean the interpreters, the professors of languages, have their safest place for speaking and declaring. What more could be desired? You are undoubtedly not burdened by that part of the decree which provides that the area should not be opened to contentions, and therefore a place for speaking is not opened to just anyone. Not only did the apostle command to avoid contention in disputes in the letter to Timothy, but also the occasions and all things through which contentions are reached. We ought indeed to hold to moderation in this matter and be most diligent and vigilant. And indeed, many examples teach us modesty. Now also, no one is prohibited from collecting aid to be distributed to the holy poor. Diligent watchfulness over the older pastors is permitted, indeed commanded.</p>
      <p>You can and should admonish and correct them, so that they may be sound in doctrine and life. Moreover, as for the threats of the magistrate, which you consider not only harsh but intolerable, we think they do not concern you at all, if you persist in your duty. A son of the family hears that he will be disinherited if he designates this or that. For thus the father threatens according to his authority.</p>
      <p>But the son, because he reveres the parent and does his duty, fears nothing of disinheritance, nor does he consider those threats to concern him. We discuss these things with you in a plainly friendly spirit, brothers to be honored and esteemed in the Lord, nor do we set ourselves as judges of your controversy. We admonish you of charity, just as we have admonished the Bernese brothers. We pray that you do not supply material for altercations and hatreds.</p>
      <p>The Bernese seem to you to have acted quite imperiously. You seem to have addressed them quite harshly. If they were now to proceed to take up your matters, which we have prayed against, everyone understands how great disturbances would break out from the smallest beginnings.</p>
      <p>We therefore beseech you by Christian charity, that you forgive each other if you have mutually offended.</p>
      <p>You have again your legitimate colloquies, provided you do not abuse them. You still have the inviolate power of choosing ministers. If anything in that controversy seems to have been said or done more harshly, forgive and overlook it: the Bernese will also overlook what seems to have been said or done by you more odiously. I beseech you, do not let contentions be renewed among you. Otherwise, the enemies are already enough threatening our necks. You are not ignorant, we suppose, of what plans the Pope is sharing with the Emperor about oppressing true religion. Let us prepare for the future struggle. Let us pray to the Lord that he may never be absent from the church and our ministry.</p>
      <p>We write these things with singular zeal and love towards you, honored and beloved brothers, and we hope that our faithful admonition will have some effect with you.</p>
      <p>We are so constrained by the affairs of our church that we very reluctantly take up foreign affairs to be handled.</p>
      <p>Farewell and always remember us in your prayers. May the Lord bless your ministry.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 8th of May, in the year of salvation 1550.</p>
      <p>Your pastors and readers, ministers of the church of Zurich, from the heart.</p>
