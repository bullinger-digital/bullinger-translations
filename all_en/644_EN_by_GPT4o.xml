      <p>S. D. The best man is the one who offers these to you, esteemed Myconius, and he himself will fully explain his entire business to you. However, ensure that everything is soon referred to the council, so that it can be resolved quickly and he can reach Schaffhausen before the first of September.</p>
      <p>If only you could also obtain travel funds for him from your people; ours gave 4 guilders. Today I reported his case to the council; and this was the response: My lords are willing to help the pious people in Lugano, but he should also present his case in Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen, and the messengers of these cities are now coming to Baden with instructions for the 3rd of September; there they will confer together. Therefore, use your role as an interpreter with the most honorable council of Basel or ensure that your chief scribe acts as an interpreter. He has many letters here, which you should demand to be shown to you, then return them so they can be used in Schaffhausen, especially return the letters addressed to me from Thaddaeus; for I sent them to you so that you might understand everything more clearly. You are handling the business of many faithful; if only your people, out of a sense of piety and humanity, would also contribute something to his travel funds.</p>
      <p>Farewell and faithfully, as a faithful servant of Christ, pursue the cause of Christ. Zurich, 21st of August, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
