      <p>The first question concerns adultery, since according to the rescript of Severus, any kind of marriage, indeed even with a betrothed, should not be violated and it is considered adultery. The question is whether, if a married man corrupts an unmarried woman, it is considered adultery and can be called such, which the jurists deny. Secondly, it is questioned whether husband and wife should be judged unequally, since in this matter Roman laws do not agree with divine laws. Thirdly, to whom is the power granted to accuse adulterers and adulteresses, and whether, if a husband knowingly retains an adulteress and bears it, the magistrate, to whom the rumor spreads, should or can accuse. Fourthly, whether the magistrate can and should pursue the crime of adultery with punishment, and also by what kind of punishment the adulterer and adulteress should be punished, in which both laws and customs vary.</p>
      <p>Fifthly, whether reconciliation can be interposed and what the mode of reconciliation is.</p>
      <p>These are the articles of the question about adulterers noted by a certain good man for the sake of memory.</p>
