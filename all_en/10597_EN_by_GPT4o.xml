      <p>Greetings. It has not yet been decided among us who will be sent to Zofingen, but we will certainly come unless something else happens in the meantime, which we will inform you of with a special messenger. If Megander is unwilling to undertake the journey, I will take it on; for neither of us can be absent for long.</p>
      <p>Today, deacons are being appointed, tomorrow a new consul and tribunes, and on the third day, the senate. Pray to the Lord to reveal who is pleasing to Him for these offices.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, I saw your letters enclosed with others sent from Lenzburg to our consul. They are certainly safe, but if they had fallen into the hands of another consul, even for the good of our republic, I fear that you might sometimes be accused by your people of revealing everything to ours. However, the prefect in Lenzburg could act more cautiously in these matters. I wanted to warn you of this, as I am somewhat concerned.</p>
      <p>If I come to Zofingen and know that you intend to come to Lenzburg, I would also like to come there (to that place).</p>
      <p>The messenger will head to St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>Regarding the church properties I recently wrote to you about, I urge you to consider it; for it seems our senate is completely mistaken, as they have no regard for how these should be used for the church and the common good of the Christian republic.</p>
      <p>Farewell again, dearest Heinrich.</p>
      <p>March 25, in the year 35.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
