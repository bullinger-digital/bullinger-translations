      <p>S. Recently, I wrote about the letters sent to the people of the Upper League in Lucerne.</p>
      <p>I did this so that people would better understand how to counter their schemes; because they try everything and are not ashamed of anything. However, they would not have needed to do this if they had not known of a weakness in the lands. Our people take this with great displeasure, as do some in the Upper League, who complain that they were not summoned to the meeting and that things were done behind their backs.</p>
      <p>If this is the case, as we learn from the writing, then no legal action is needed; because the matter is already settled; the letter and seal should stand.</p>
      <p>4th of November.</p>
      <p>You know the hand.</p>
      <p>because Zizers (although papists) have stood loyally.</p>
