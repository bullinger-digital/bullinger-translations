      <p>I received two letters from you, most excellent Bullinger, although I wrote to you only once since I left you. The cause of my silence was not forgetfulness, for how could I forget you, among whom I left half of myself, indeed my whole self reborn in Paul Lismanini, nor negligence nor lethargy. You remember, indeed, with what speed I completed the journey to Geneva in the middle of winter, being only two years younger than you, nor did my solitude, from which my servant went to and returned from Kraków twice in a single day, whenever he pleased, lack of subject matter failed a man who is not at all poetic, indeed truly Laconic.</p>
      <p>It was one thing to chat with my little wife, with my Lelio, with Mr. Guerner about domestic matters, but quite another to write to you about the state of religion, about which I had nothing certain before, nor do I see now, except that the Lord in wondrous ways protects His own and restrains the impious. Do these not seem miracles to you, that Aloysius Lippomanus, who for almost this whole two-year period terrified the Poles like a donkey dressed in a lion's skin, was confounded by the arrival of Mr. Johannes a Lasco and the vigor of Mr. Vergerius from this kingdom, if not secretly, yet by another way than he openly professed, departed, while Lismanini, indeed proscribed by his work, dines in a wooden hypocaust with the most illustrious men Mr. Johannes a Lasco and Mr. Vergerius, conversing about such admirable works of God? You will learn the rest and every little detail from Mr. Vergerius, who has been among people while I was meanwhile hiding in solitude.</p>
      <p>When the reverend Mr. Johannes a Lasco returns from the king, which we hope will be before Easter, I will write either from here or, as I believe sooner, from Königsberg, where, free from proscription until the future assembly, I will enjoy the company of the most illustrious Duke of Prussia. Thus it seemed to the church, to which both God and my calling compel me to obey.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man and to me in every way to be honored, and be mindful of the Polish churches and your Lismanini in your prayers to God. I respectfully and lovingly greet your domestic church, your learned and pious sons-in-law Mr. Zwingli, Lavater, and Simler, and their most honorable wives, your dearest daughters.</p>
      <p>If my wife needs your help in any matter during her journey, do not fail her, assured that you will make me whole either through the merchants of St. Gallen or through my Stanislaus. From the Sarmatian wilderness, March 6, 1557.</p>
      <p>Not only do the reverend Mr. Felix Cruciger, superintendent, and Mr. Alexander Vitrellinus, pastor of Pinczów, give you the greatest thanks for valuing them so highly, but all their fellow ministers, whose names I send you written here, respectfully greet you and earnestly pray that you may both encourage and console them with your learned and pious letters, and always help them with your prayers to the Lord. Gregorius Paulus, master of liberal arts, a learned man and in all things agreeing with the churches of Zürich and Geneva, minister of the church of Christ in Pelsnice. Jacobus Sylvius, minister of the church of Christ in Kreziczyeze.</p>
      <p>Stanislaus Liuthomirski, of the equestrian order, an indefatigable soldier of Christ, a learned and eloquent minister of the church in small Kazimierz. Stanislaus Sarniczki, of the equestrian order, a learned minister of the church of Christ in Niedzwiecz. Martinus Croviezki, of the equestrian order, learned, pious, and eloquent minister of the church of Włocławek. Martinus Taurinus, outstanding in zeal and vigor, minister of the church at the great Mr. Martin Sborowski, palatine of Kalisz. Johannes Siekirenczki, of the equestrian order, distinguished in piety, minister of the church in Iwanowicze at the great Mrs. Agneta Dluskam, the noble mother of Nicholas and Albert Dlusiorum, who are your guests. Melchior Philipenski, of the equestrian order, minister of the church in Cossow.</p>
      <p>I wanted you to know these men by name, both because they often visited me hiding in the wilderness and because they delight in your writings, especially the Decades and the Apologetic Compendium and Exposition. There are more in Greater Poland, in Russia, in Masovia, and in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, some of whom I know by face and name, but I have not discussed you with them due to the great distance of the places. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To be able to pronounce Polish names besides Polish students, consult Mr. Theodor, whom I heard arguing with my Stanislaus about the word Krezieczycze, etc.</p>
      <p>I ask that he be respectfully greeted by me through you.</p>
      <p>I finally received these letters at the end of the year 1557 at the Christmas festival through Laelius from Vergerius, from whom he was coming, and I received them sealed.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and most excellent in piety Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich and... most honorable father.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
