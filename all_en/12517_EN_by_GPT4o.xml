    <p xml:id="regest1">What did Bullinger communicate in the letter written during the night [not received], which he mentioned in another letter the following day [not received]? Myconius is worried because unrest is occurring. [Ludwig von] Reischach, who always holds the Emperor [Charles V] in high regard, recently reported that the troops, which had been stationed for a while at the Upper Lake Constance and near the Swabian cities, have disappeared. Now Myconius also learned that Emperor [Charles V] has ordered his commanders to muster troops in Füssen on June 30. Germany is on the brink of war. Only God can save. The Emperor might experience something similar to [Henry of] Brunswick.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- [Francis I of] France and [Henry VIII of] England are said to have made peace, which greatly displeases the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Eight theologians have drawn up a formula of agreement on the contentious religious issues. However, no changes were made to the doctrine of the Mass, Purgatory, and the intercession of the saints. This likely corresponds to the Emperor's notion of peace for Germany!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- A few days ago, Myconius wrote to [Rudolf] Gwalther and sent the letter with a learned Zürcher [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Greetings, among others, to Gwalther and his wife [Regula, née Zwingli].</p>

      <p>S. "As I wrote to you last night, so I come today," etc. I do not understand this of yours, because I have received nothing of yours so briefly. Therefore, I am anxious about what you mean. I see the unrest that has arisen, but nothing more. From Lord von Reischach, I heard the day before yesterday that a troop of soldiers has flown from Lake Constance and the Swabian cities. Today I hear that the Emperor has summoned his commanders, who have been stationed at the town of Füssen, where a muster will be held on the last day of this month, and he has said that the war will be beneficial for all of Germany. Reischach, in his usual manner, insists that the Emperor is holy and even a man to be revered, and that he will not attempt anything against Germany. I write this because I do not know what your letters contain. But indeed, let Israel hope in the Lord, for with the Lord there is mercy and with him is abundant redemption. We all know what happened to [Henry of] Brunswick. What if the same happens to the Emperor? I know our ingratitude deserves evil. But I also know that the Lord's mercy is much greater than our sins. Let us not cease to invoke him faithfully, and we will receive help from the Lord.</p>

      <p>Besides this, it is reported that peace has been made between [Francis I of] France and [Henry VIII of] England, and the Emperor takes this very badly.</p>

      <p>Eight theologians have been appointed to harmonize the contentious articles in religion, but nothing is to be changed regarding the Mass, Purgatory, and the intercession of the saints. This is what the Emperor has said more than once: He will make peace in Germany before he departs. The Lord be with us.</p>

      <p>Farewell with your household in the Lord. I wrote to [Rudolf] Gwalther a few days ago through a learned Zürcher. I fear he may not have received it, which I would regret. Please greet him and his wife.</p>
