      <p>S. I give thanks to you, most esteemed lord and godfather, for the booklet of reformation or repentance instituted among you; if only it were instituted and maintained everywhere! For the pressing necessity would demand this; but anything else is rather instituted and accepted than this. May the Lord grant this world a better mind!</p>
      <p>I also received what you wrote at the same time, and that rumor, which was also brought to us from elsewhere about the victory of Orange, somewhat refreshed us; but soon, with a different rumor arising and the people of Strasbourg writing the opposite, our joy was interrupted. Yet we are still not certain about the outcome, as some affirm one thing and others another, nor could the Palatine's messenger, who passed through here three or four days ago, report anything certain about this matter. I saw what you wrote about these matters in your two letters to Mr. Steiger; he discussed all this with me, and since he hears various rumors being spread among you about our people, that they were in Solothurn and promised something to the Swiss, he ordered me to respond to you: Our neighbors from Freiburg and Unterwalden have been greatly disturbed by some (it is believed to be the other places), who have made them believe that the Bernese would suddenly attack them, because the expedition was arranged with such urgency with witnesses and all things, that if necessity required, they could attack them at any moment. They thought they would be attacked, therefore the people of Freiburg moved their artillery to the walls and towers, made strong preparations in the city and country, and similarly the people of Unterwalden at the Br√ºnig.</p>
      <p>It is also said that the other Confederates promised them to stand by them with life and goods. This caused my lords to send their embassy to Solothurn to inform the Confederates generally about this and to show them that they should not expect anything like this from them; for they are not otherwise minded than to keep faith, honor, and oath, and the boundaries of the land with them, and to admonish them to do the same and to conclude what they intend. Otherwise, he reports that he has nothing special at this time, and wonders that you did not know this; for my lords were informed of this by your lords through a special messenger sent here for this purpose. As for the Count Palatine, he thinks well that the cities will discuss with each other and not act without the other. Roset from Geneva also writes that they are informed that the queen in England and her chancellor have been poisoned; yet he does not rely on it too much; for the news from Geneva is not always certain. He, who at the same time sends you many greetings and thanks you greatly and shows me the gifts with which you have honored him. There is always much and very good wine in Rolle, therefore I hope there will be something again.</p>
      <p>Your father-in-law and Telamonius, our relative, greet you. He bids you farewell as he is leaving for his prefecture tomorrow. Farewell. Greet all friends and brothers.</p>
      <p>Bern, October 14, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>After I wrote this, today those two letters from Mr. Beza were brought to me, of which he wants one to be communicated to you, so I send both; you will return them when it pleases you. Also, writings in French were sent to me from elsewhere, from which you will see (for Mr. Gwalther can interpret), what triumphs our adversaries are celebrating and what mask they put on this robbery of theirs; but the Lord lives, who will someday examine how true these things are. Today also came to our city the two sons of Mr. Admiral and one of Mr. Andelot, who, as we think, will stay here for some time. Mr. Steiger also summons me and ordered me to inform you of two other things. The first is, concerning the passage granted to the Swiss, that they have violated the peace and the land's peace and have found so much that they cannot deny them the passage with any justification. Yet it is arranged in such a way that it will be kept. But if the passage goes through, they will write to the French legate and the chief of the Confederates, that in view of the doors and the deaths in the French land, and also the displeasure of our country people, which they have from the passage, they should make it through as soon and as briefly as possible, and pay the hosts honorably, so that no mischief arises.</p>
      <p>He says, nothing will come of the expedition at this time; the king has postponed it until the next spring.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, running away has been forbidden under penalty of life and limb.</p>
      <p>The second is, that I should write to you in secret, in which he also especially desires your counsel and opinion: The people of Geneva have long sought from the Confederates that they might be admitted into the alliance like other allies. This has now been completely rejected by the papist places. Meanwhile, Basel has declared that they are willing to support the people of Geneva and my lords with life and goods; likewise, Schaffhausen has also done so; only Zurich holds back continuously and has no other command than to listen. Therefore, my lords have caused an embassy to be sent to Zurich to the council and citizens (for it is heard that the citizens would not be unwilling if the matter could only be left to them), to bring a final and clear decision; for it is thought that if any need arises for us, it would begin at Geneva, where it would be better to defend in the distance than to wait until the enemy comes into the land. Yet he would like to know in secret what you think about this; he would like to write to you himself, but he has much to do, and since I am very secret, he has entrusted this to me; let him greet you heartily with this. Given as above.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
