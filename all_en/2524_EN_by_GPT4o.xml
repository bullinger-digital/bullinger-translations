      <p>The grace of Christ be with you, most excellent Bullinger, esteemed in Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>It is true, as the old proverb says in Solomon: Hope deferred makes the heart sick. For I, along with our Nicolaus, desiring the glory of Christ to be promoted among the people of Rappoltsweiler, and having anxiously awaited many offered opportunities, expected a kind response from Baron Egenolph, who seemed to us to embrace Christ with all his heart. Furthermore, we publicly prayed in our churches, with supplications to God through Jesus Christ, that He might incline the baron's heart, so that he would not deny in action what he had confessed with his mouth until now.</p>
      <p>We commended our good and exiled brother Willing, urging that he should conclude the matter on a certain day as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>To this end, I wrote certain articles to him, indicating with what piety and constancy of mind, and with whose counsel, namely the pious who had applied their minds to the study of piety, and with what faith this heavenly and divine work should be undertaken, etc., and that he should not doubt that God's perpetual help would not be lacking for the endeavors begun.</p>
      <p>But we seem to have asked for water from a pumice stone; he responds nothing, although his mother has diligently urged him. Hence we certainly understand that we are waiting in vain, and while we thought the mountains would give birth, we now see a ridiculous mouse being born, and this young man being seduced by the wicked counsels of malevolent people, who fear that the Romans, taking away their place and nation, will come. O contempt and idol of human wisdom, which does not submit itself to God; o harsh judgment on those who are in power. We regret having cast pearls before swine; nevertheless, we will pray that God grants them repentance from dead works.</p>
      <p>You will inform Mr. Johann Willing of these things, so that he no longer waits for those who waver and consult flesh and blood; there will be a place for him where he can preside with greater fruit.</p>
      <p>The arrival of our prince is announced daily by couriers; but it has not yet happened to see him. The rumor grows more and more that he has taken a virgin as a wife; if only he would return as the husband of one wife. Our church is doing well enough except for this, that the undisciplined continually defile everything with their luxury and can hardly be restrained, etc. There are various rumors of war, but uncertain.</p>
      <p>Strange things are reported about your neighbors, if only they were false, etc. Albert of Brandenburg, etc., is secretly raising an army, but for whom, it is unknown; he threatens the bishop of Trier and Strasbourg and wrote to the nobles gathered in Frankfurt in this manner: "Do as you will, I must shorten the robe of the long priest of Trier and hunt the hare-catcher of Strasbourg with dogs; but if I fail, it is for me to do with a piece of meat." There are various intrigues; spring and summer will reveal everything. Woe to the unrepentant Germans. I am doing well enough, though physically weak, as I carry myself around leaning on a staff, etc.</p>
      <p>Pray for us with all the brothers, that the word of Christ may not be blasphemed, which we will likewise do for yours.</p>
      <p>Greet in our name all the household, brothers, and friends. Riquewihr, January 8, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Erb.</p>
      <p>Nikolaus and all the others greet you, etc.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man of piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, dearest brother, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, etc.</p>
