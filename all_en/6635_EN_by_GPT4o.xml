      <p>Greetings. I have received nothing from Geneva; as soon as I receive anything, I will send it. Since a messenger conveniently presented himself to me here, who, although he is from Baden, has been known to me for many years, I am sending to you and to Mr. Gwalther each a Savoy cabbage through him, and I ask that you kindly accept these small gifts. I know I owe you more; but at present, nothing else occurs to me by which I can at least in some way testify to my gratitude to you. I will do so more liberally in the future, God willing. I also pray that the Lord grants you and all yours many, most prosperous, and happiest years. The same wishes are sent to you by Mr. Steiger, Graffenried, MÃ¼linen, my father-in-law, mother, and wife. May the Lord always keep you safe!</p>
      <p>Bern, January 2, 1566.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours entirely and forever.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished men, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger and Rudolf Gwalther, the most faithful pastors of the Zurich church, my lords to be perpetually respected.</p>
