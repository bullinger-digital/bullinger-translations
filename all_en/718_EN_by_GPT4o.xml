      <p> Greetings. Meanwhile, since I sent letters to you through Pellican, my dearest compadre in the Lord, I have spoken with the treasurer Haller about retaining my compadre Johannes Haller here. He replied that he is waiting for the lords until Haller himself declares his intention in this matter. Afterwards, I also met with my compadre and asked him whether he had settled his case there in Zurich. He replied briefly: "Why should I do this, when there is no one pressing me?" I added that he could not leave this church with a good conscience. He replied: "As I have always said, so I say now. I commend this matter to my lords in Zurich, who sent me here. I will obey them, provided the Bernese do what is fair and not inconvenient to my needs." Now, with your prudence, it is necessary to finally bring this matter to an end with your people there. The treasurer also added that he had received letters from you, in which you urge that my needs be considered a little more liberally, and that he will take care of it to the best of his ability. For your concern, I give you my greatest thanks. </p>
      <p> Furthermore, I am sending here ecclesiastical histories, so that what you have read so far in fragments, you may henceforth read in a continuous and complete series. May the Lord preserve you and all yours by His grace, my dearest compadre. My people send greetings to all of yours. Greet the lords and brothers, Mr. Bibliander, Gwalther, Pellican, our Gervasius, now a trigamist and doubly inept in the name of the papal priesthood. </p>
      <p> Bern, 21st of October, 1549. </p>
      <p> Wolfgang Musculus, yours in the Lord. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his dearest compadre in the Lord. In Zurich. </p>
