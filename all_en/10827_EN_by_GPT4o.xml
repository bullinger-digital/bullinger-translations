    <p xml:id="regest1">Regarding Columan [Ryß], administrator [of the Carthusian monastery Ittingen], Mayor Röist is mistaken; Werdmüller has indeed sent him documents from his predecessor Jodok [Hesch], another bad person. Could not respond more quickly due to his gout illness.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord God through Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>My master Heinrich, regarding Columan, know that my lord Röist is mistaken. Indeed, before him there was another fellow, also an administrator, named Jodok, who is now a prior in Franconia. I have brought letters from him, which my lord Röist speaks of, although I now know Columan well as a slanderer and a vessel of all shamelessness, as his words and deeds testify, etc.</p>
      <p>Do not hold the delay against me; for the severe gout, which I will attempt to alleviate with spa treatments, has been so troublesome until now that my hands could not hold a pen.</p>
      <p>My most learned Heinrich, the Lord be with you.</p>
      <p>From Rickenbach, April 8, 1536.</p>
      <p>Ulrich Werdmüller, your humble servant.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my gracious lord and brother.</p>
