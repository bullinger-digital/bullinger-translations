    <p xml:id="regest1">We have read the document drafted by the Bernese council after the negotiations with Capito and Bucer and welcome the explicit confirmation of the previous doctrinal foundations. However, since they have not been content with this, the people of Zurich urge unity in the doctrine of the Lord's Supper. The clarity and simplicity of the previous doctrine benefits the Church and pleases God. As the example of the Ark of the Covenant shows, God punishes both the underestimation and the overestimation of the sacrament. Only in unity can the Church endure, as Paul teaches and experience shows; since disputes among pastors, especially those arising from changes in doctrine, encourage opponents and offend the faithful, they urgently ask to refrain from innovations. The Bernese pastors should also work with the council to ensure that future actions are taken jointly and that Melanchthon's announced response from Luther is awaited first; after five meetings on this matter took place last year, enough has been done for the moment. This request is not an interference: The people of Zurich themselves adhere to these principles and, as the enclosed copy of the letter proves, have been asked by Bern to do so; two resolutions from last year also state that nothing should be changed in the confession without consultation. As long as this is not refuted, peace is best served by steadfastly adhering to it and rejecting no one who accepts it.</p>

      <p>Grace, peace, and mercy through our Lord Jesus Christ be with you, dear brothers.</p>
      <p>We have read the confession that the honorable small and large council of Bern gave to Doctors Capito and Martin Bucer after the negotiations with you. And we are pleased with you that you remain steadfast by God's word and in this well-founded disputation and general confession, established in Basel, and that you continue to teach in the church of Bern as is proper, especially avoiding the uncustomary words substantial, bodily, natural, supernatural, invisible, miraculous, fleshly, and unspeakable. Furthermore, when the figurative speeches occur, especially concerning the sacrament of the Lord's Supper, they should also be explained according to the usage and understanding of the synod of the church in Bern.</p>
      <p>If it had remained simply with such an answer, it would have pleased us even more. However, since you have engaged somewhat further with the brothers from Strasbourg, which might also give others occasion over time to make further inroads and claims, through which we might be led away from our confession over time, it is our brotherly, heartfelt, and urgent request to you that you receive this our letter, which is written out of loyalty, with loving hearts from us and for the first time strive that you hold each other in good regard, love each other in truth, not become double-minded in understanding, agree together and be of one mind with each other in your decision and teaching concerning the holy supper.</p>
      <p>You know, dear brothers, what clear understanding can achieve in all things, likewise what clear truth can achieve in the church of God. The Spirit of God, who is a light and inwardly draws and teaches, without which all external teaching is in vain, teaches deeply in hearts, hates darkness. Thus it is that the teacher always produces more fruit with simple clarity than with hidden presentation. The teacher is also more courageous with clarity, and the whole church stands more firmly with clarity; for it knows and understands on what it is founded. The secret judgment of all believing hearts also falls to simple truth. But now you and we have so far written, taught, and preached clearly and briefly about the matter of the Lord's Supper with God's help. There is no one among those who otherwise have not contrary and envious hearts against the truth of Christ who has not understood us and can also say in brief words what the sacrament is, why it was instituted, and what its fruit and use are. Therefore, let us indeed continue in our simplicity, which certainly pleases our Lord, steadfastly and unanimously. The Lord is indeed in the midst of us.</p>
      <p>The Israelites added too much to the Ark of God, which was a prominent sacrament, and said: "Let us bring the Ark into the camp, that it may save us from the hand of our enemies" [1 Sam 4:3]. But it was not given to them for that, but as a sign that God wanted to be among them if they kept His covenant. Since they added too much to their sacrament, God punished them. And later, when they held too little of it, God punished them again. But you, dear brothers, have learned well to rightly divide the word of God, so that you neither add too much nor too little to it. Many complain that too little is done about the matter, but one errs no less when one does too much.</p>
      <p>What unity in good can achieve, you know well, since it is known that it can achieve much even in evil and wicked matters. The holy apostle Paul says: "I beseech you, dear brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfectly joined together in the same mind and in the same judgment" [1 Cor 1:10]. And in another place, the same Paul says: "If there is any consolation in Christ, if any comfort of love, if any fellowship of the Spirit, if any bowels and mercies, fulfill my joy, that you be like-minded, having the same love, being of one accord, of one mind. Let nothing be done through strife or vainglory; but in lowliness of mind let each esteem others better than themselves. Look not every man on his own things, but every man also on the things of others" [Phil 2:1-4]. You know what the heathen says: Through unity, small things grow and become great, through disunity, even great things are brought to nothing. That God still keeps us, the servants of the word of the church of Zurich, in unity and we bear with each other well, not despising each other, but holding each other dear and worthy, holds off many storms for us, makes us much peace and other people with us. Where there is disunity, no church can stand. If you servants of the word do not want to hold each other in good regard, do not want to hold each other dear and worthy, you can well think that it would not remain with your disunity alone. The parties extend into the council and into the community in the city and into the countryside. What happens then? The adversaries take heart, the disobedient hope for the rise of all wantonness, the papists promise themselves the rise of their antichristian kingdom. They say: "Behold, the builders at the tower of Babylon no longer understand each other. The matter will turn out well. They will destroy themselves without a sword stroke. Let them do, let them do." Here the name of God and the holy gospel are mocked, and the time that should be well spent with preaching and admonishing to true hope and innocence, to right faith and steadfastness in all good, likewise that one should abstain from ungodly living and be thankful to Christ, all this time is wasted and consumed with quarreling, disputing, fighting, opposing, and answering. Then there is no love or peace in the hearts of either the teachers or the hearers. Yet God is a God of peace and there are enough enemies of God present when we are already united and faithfully fighting against them. It is miserable when the servants, who are servants of one Lord, fight with each other and in those things in which they were previously united with God. Meanwhile, the good-hearted sheep of Christ stand in danger. They are separated and severely misled; the weak are driven back and destroyed in the fights. O what severe punishment threatens the Lord to those who give offense! Although we now hope that such admonition to unity is not necessary with you, dear brothers, in the known truth to preach, yet the times are so dangerous and the devil so earnestly goes about to tear the churches apart, that we think this our admonition will bear its fruit in due time. And indeed, nothing brings more unwillingness and disunity in the churches than when different forms of teaching are used, now acting thus, soon making a change in the same. Therefore, we are begged for God's sake to always proceed in truth simply and rightly, also unanimously, avoiding all innovations, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we desire of you and also ask that you work on this and, if it comes to pass, procure and achieve with an honorable council in Bern that in future common matters concerning religion and our confession, common counsel be taken, and also that everything that may concern us be postponed and deferred until Doctor Luther responds to our writing, written to him from Basel, according to Philipp Melanchthon's promise. And such a postponement can be blamed on no one reasonable; for we have already done enough in this matter.</p>
      <p>For the second time, the Swiss churches have dealt with Doctor Luther: once, when very friendly letters were written from Aarau on the day to Strasbourg and the preachers of Strasbourg were given a friendly recommendation to deal with Doctor Luther; the second time, when a special friendly writing was sent to him from Basel. So with great effort, cost, and labor, five meetings have been attended in this matter, four in Basel and one in Aarau, all in the past year 1536. We do not know what we should do further or what more could have been demanded of us.</p>
      <p>Here we ask you, however, not to take offense at this our request and suspect us, as if we intended to be your bishop and visitors or provincials. God knows our heart, and you should not see us as anything other than that we desire to be your brothers and fellow servants of the Lord Jesus and His community. What we now request of you is solely so that we remain united and undivided, we and our churches, and become ever more steadfast and faithful to each other. And what we desire of you, we have so far faithfully kept with you. It is apparent that when our dear brothers from Basel, Dominus Grynaeus and Myconius, came here to Zurich in August of the past year 1536 and presented articles from Strasbourg, neither an honorable government of the city of Zurich nor we, the servants of the word, wanted to give any definitive answer without the knowledge and consent of the church in Bern, and others who have established a common confession with us. If you examine the writings that were written to you at that time, you will find it so. Likewise, now after the Schmalkaldic report, nothing definitive has been wanted to be answered until Doctor Luther's writing is received. We also cannot think that this our request could be against the will of an honorable government in Bern, since they wrote to us within a year's time under their city secret and demanded of us that we now renew nothing. Therefore, you have here the copy of the letter. When one then examines the resolutions of Basel of February 4 and March 27 in the year 1536, they can mean nothing else and sound as if one place should not act definitively without the other concerning the established confession, whether to add or subtract.</p>
      <p>All this we write not with the intention that we have our thing alone and want to share it with everyone, or to reject other churches and separate ourselves from all other churches, but all our intention is that we are not separated and rejected by others. We have once confessed the truth; now it is up to us to remain steadfast by it and wait to see if anyone wants to refute our confession and give a better report. Since that does not happen, there is no need to stand by the recognized truth with simplicity. There is no need for other confessions, no other prescriptions, as long as this is not refuted. Once the confession is made, where we are questioned about our faith, we then present this confession. What can one answer more simply and better to all those who question us than: We have a confession; we want to hear what is wrong and untrue in it. Let everyone else answer for their own particular thing; this confession, however, is common to all churches. Further, we should be satisfied with all those who are satisfied with us and do not reject us for our confession. Our churches have lacked nothing necessary. Since God then advises us to peace, we should not make ourselves restless, but stand in peace and wait to see who wants to teach us better.</p>
      <p>Thus much we have wanted to deal with you this time in brotherly love as the dearest brothers. Asking you to receive it kindly and love us, also pray for us and our churches, that God may preserve us in the well-being of truth with unity according to His will and have fatherly mercy on all His churches, through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, November 28, 1537.</p>
      <p>Preachers, readers of the holy scripture, deacons, and servants of the churches</p>
      <p>Zurich all together, your beloved brothers and fellow servants in the Lord.</p>
