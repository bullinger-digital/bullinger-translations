    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Since Travers has a messenger available, he does not want to let him go without a letter, even if he cannot report anything certain about the events occurring in the region of Ingolstadt between the camps of the Emperor [Charles V] and the princes [John Frederick of Saxony and Philip of Hesse] to the well-informed Bullinger through his friends. Rather, Bullinger should share what he has learned so that it can also be conveyed to the other brothers who appreciate Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The Confederates are said to be divided because some support the Hessian Landgrave, while others support the Emperor. This raises the question of whether the friendship between the Helvetians will break during the course of the war. What does Bullinger think about this?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The current messenger is Travers’ son-in-law. He is accompanying two nephews [...] on his brother's side, who are coming to Zurich for their education. They are from a good Catholic family. Bullinger should help the son-in-law find a decent host. The host will be paid whatever he demands.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Travers’ son, Johannes [the Younger], is now studying with other fellow students in Freiburg im Breisgau with [Heinrich] Glarean. Travers [the Elder] hopes for good progress for him from this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Everything is peaceful in Italy. In the Milanese region, the harvest was good, so food is no longer scarce. There is peace in the Confederacy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Should Travers be able to assist Bullinger, he would be very happy to do so.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Having found the opportunity of a messenger, most esteemed man, I deemed it worthy to send my letter to you, even if I have no other occasion than to inquire from you, the standard of truth, about what has been done so far in the camps of the Emperor and the princes of the empire in the region of Ingolstadt. Various reports, inconsistent with the truth, are brought to us daily by uncertain messengers; to you, whatever the Emperor and the opposing princes have done, has undoubtedly been conveyed by the writings of friends and truth. Therefore, I urge you, excellent Bullinger, not to hesitate to share with us what you have learned in these matters, so that I may be able to make other brothers, who are eager for such things, participants in your knowledge.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Furthermore, rumor has spread among the people that our Swiss are nurturing discord among themselves, moved by the affections of the Emperor's party or the Hessian prince; hence it is doubted whether the Helvetian friendship will be severed by the success of war. If you have any sense of what will happen in this matter, relieve the curious mind of a friend with your writings.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Moreover, the present messenger, my son-in-law, has brought two nephews from my brother to Zurich for education in good letters and morals; they are born of good and Catholic men. I ask you, most friendly brother, to assist in this plan, so that they may be entrusted to a worthy man, a lover of virtues. Whatever is to be expended for them will be sent without hesitation.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>My son Johannes has set out from Zurich to Freiburg im Breisgau, accompanied by some fellow students, to attend the lectures of Master Glarean; I hope for good progress under the guidance of the heavens.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>We have nothing worthy of writing about new matters. In Italy, all is peaceful, and in the Milanese region, the abundance of crops has removed all scarcity of things; we live in the desired tranquility. If I could serve you in any way, it would be my joy; command, and I will obey from the heart.</p>
      <p>Farewell, sweetest brother.</p>

      <p>From Zuoz, 11 days before the Kalends of November 1546.</p>
      <p>From the heart, devoted to you, Johannes Travers the Elder.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful minister of the Orthodox Church of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, Zurich ecclesiastic, my most esteemed lord and most observant brother.</p>
