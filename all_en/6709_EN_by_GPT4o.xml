      <p>Revered Father Bullinger. Greetings. If ever there was a time for my friends to forgive me, it is now, when they receive letters from me more slowly than they would like and friendship seems to demand, as I am extremely busy and do not have someone to transcribe my poorly written letters. Certainly, whether I love and respect you above others, as I ought, you yourself know so well that there is no need for assertion or proof. Therefore, you can easily gather from this how much grief I have conceived in my mind when I heard about the death of your dearest wife and also your most excellent daughters, not to mention the truly holy, most learned, and in every way most accomplished doctor C[onrad] Gesner, a friend to all good people and an ornament of all Europe, who has departed from us to heaven. I did not receive this grief for their sake, indeed I sincerely congratulate them, but for our sake, for the sake of friends, and especially for your sake, whom I see in your very old age, when you most need comfort, gradually being deprived day by day of those by whom you were accustomed to be cared for, refreshed, and comforted. The Lord knows how much I sympathize with you and grieve for your situation, my revered Father Bullinger, especially since I know, although you are most endowed with the spirit of God, prudence, and wisdom, that you are neither God, in whom no grief falls, nor a senseless block, but a man, and not a Stoic, but a Christian. However, what I know comforts and refreshes you in these your afflictions, that same thing diminishes and softens my grief, Christian piety, by which we know that nothing adverse happens to us that was not destined for us by the Father before the foundation of the world, and that not for our destruction, but for salvation in Christ Jesus. Why should we not want what the Lord wants, and embrace with a willing mind what the heavenly Father offers us for salvation in His own time? Strengthened by this faith and piety, it cannot be otherwise than that God, the Father of all consolation, comforts us not only outside of tribulation but in the very tribulation and all our affliction. Therefore, let there be praise, honor, and glory to this Father through Christ forever. I ask you to do the same duty in my name with Lord Gwalter and your sons-in-law, my most esteemed brothers, as I do not have the time to write to each one, and greet them all. The plague has taken many from here, but it seems to have now abated. As for the new pope, there is no need to write, except that there is hope that he will benefit the church more with his hypocrisy than all others have harmed it with their most wicked vices and pursuits of this age. He is a rustic monk, a Dominican, an inquisitor, a notable hypocrite, but he pretends to live a most holy life. Many letters are circulated written in the vernacular about the sanctity of this antichrist: that he still wears a monastic undergarment, namely woolen, and refuses linen, is content with monastic food, namely two eggs and a bowl of broth or bread crumbs, does not want to give anything from the church's patrimony to his own, says he does not want to conquer heretics with arms, but with prayers to God, holiness of life, and the holy scriptures, does not want to admit anyone to ecclesiastical offices unless they are literate and of honest life, that the church does not need wealth, but learned and holy men. Miracles are expected from him, so that we might say this is the last antichrist expected at the end of the world.</p>
      <p>If you did not understand the death of the deceased antichrist Pius IV, what it was like, hear this: among the embraces of a Roman courtesan from the noble Capisucci family, whose name is Papyria, after the third encounter, a man of 68 years, he most sweetly departed to the underworld. This is consistently written and proclaimed. Many satirical verses are circulated about this matter; but besides others, this monument of gratitude is dedicated everywhere in Rome to Papyria and affixed in public places: To Papyria Capisucci, the papicide, the liberator of the fatherland, the Senate and People of Rome.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Your Z[anchi].</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zurich and most revered father. Zurich.</p>
