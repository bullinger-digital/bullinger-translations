      <p>Greetings. I know how much your piety delights in the letters of friends, in which the state of the churches is described: and not without reason, since all the churches scattered throughout the world are but one house of God; and we see that the Apostle Paul gladly learned the state of the churches from others, and in turn diligently informed others. This matter compelled me, though otherwise more than occupied, to write to your kindness, so that you might know that the English church and our foreign churches here in London, the German and the French, flourish by the great benefit of God.</p>
      <p>Our foreign churches are often attacked by false bishops with strange arts and schemes; but so far Christ has prevailed, and has turned everything to the promotion of the church, so much so that now no foreigner can have access to English citizenship unless he first makes some confession of his faith before the ministers of the foreign churches. If this lasts for a few years, this kingdom will be freed from the great and various errors that are usually introduced by sectarian foreigners. A parliament is convened for the first of March: may the Lord grant that it brings something good for the church: certainly, I can foresee nothing bad yet. The Latin lectures in our churches have been interrupted since the death of Mr. Johannes a Lasco's wife, and he has not yet been able to resume them before Easter (although he is moderately well with his new wife, whom he married on January 29th) due to his various, or rather the church's, affairs. But I hope that this break from lectures will be compensated by some great benefit to the church. We expect Mr. Hooper in London within three days, who, as I hear, is to preach before the royal majesty on the twenty-sixth of this month. I would never have hoped for such fidelity and diligence in his bishopric, when others are usually rendered mute and sluggish by a rich morsel thrown into their mouths. The wife of Mr. Peter Martyr passed away four days ago. Mr. Johannes Utenhovius, who was in despair of life two months ago, has now (thanks be to the Lord!) recovered.</p>
      <p>Would that you would once publish the heads of your sermons on Isaiah, the books of Samuel and Kings, the Acts of the Apostles, the epistle to the Romans, and whatever else you have gathered! Truly, in my judgment, more could be drawn from them for a solid understanding of Scripture than from the great commentaries of many. If I dared to advise you, I would try to persuade you: but since I am not aware of your plans, and I do not doubt that you desire nothing but the edification of the church, I dare not rashly advise anything here, I only indicate what I think; but I would not indicate it unless I had gathered fruit from it myself.</p>
      <p>As for public matters, we enjoy peace in this kingdom: may the Lord grant that we use it for piety. Charles the Emperor, being in poor health, was brought to Brussels on the sixth of this month.</p>
      <p>Our native priests are burdened with great exactions, from which they themselves begin to fear somewhat for their kingdom. May God turn everything to the promotion of His kingdom. Amen. Please deign to greet my esteemed teachers, Mr. Pellicanus, Mr. Bibliander, and Mr. Gesner. Mr. Johannes a Lasco and Johannes Utenhovius have also wished to send their greetings to them, but especially to you.</p>
      <p>London, February 18, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours as much as he is, Martin Micronius.</p>
      <p>To the most pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
