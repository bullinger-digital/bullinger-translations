      <p>Greetings. I received your brief letters, most excellent and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>From these, I understand that you have received news from St. Gallen and Augsburg that Marseille was nearly snatched away from the King of France by the Pope's treachery. This indeed seems very likely, as I am not unaware that the Roman Pope would not be Pope unless he were such a traitor, bloodthirsty, a parricide, a disturber of all kingdoms, and a supplanter of true religion, a support of idolatry; but the Lord will soon crush him. From Spain, I have long heard that the seed of the gospel is sprouting there and that many have been miserably slaughtered for the sake of purer religion, yet nonetheless, the Church of Christ is growing, which flourishes and grows as if nourished by the blood of martyrs. Recently, it has been reported that Catalonia and Aragon, kingdoms of Spanish power, have voluntarily rejected the Spanish Inquisition. If this is true, we will soon hear more.</p>
      <p>The Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg is so loyal to the Guises that he has convened a diet in Brussels on March 16, above Speyer, to faithfully advocate the cause of these bloodthirsty ones.</p>
      <p>I also hear that the Elector Palatine has been called there, mainly to be admonished seriously to cease being a Sacramentarian and to stop supporting the Zwinglians. They will lead the good prince to school; if he is brave and distances himself from them, he will have a good outcome and will not have to be a miserable sheep and say to all that the coarse fanatics (for they are the real fanatics) sing and say: "It pleases the honorable lords," with due support, etc. I trust in God, he will soon curb their arrogance and pride.</p>
      <p>A diet is now being held in Aarau by the four cities, Zurich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen. Our envoy, Mr. von Cham, the consul, went there today.</p>
      <p>And since our Calvin wrote to me the day before yesterday: "When I sent letters to our Ambrosius Blaurer in recent days, I could not write to you, but now I make amends, etc." From this, I gather that you either have not yet received those letters or you do not use the same openness towards me that I use towards you by sharing everything, etc. Here were the envoys of the Margravine of Neuburg explaining the Landau magistrate's business. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 23, 1562. Greet the brothers and friends. Yours truly.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blaurer, citizen of Winterthur, and faithful servant of Christ, esteemed lord and dearest brother. Winterthur.</p>
