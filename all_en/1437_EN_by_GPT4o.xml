      <p>Greetings and blessings. I have nothing to write at the moment, venerable lord and most esteemed brother, except that I have certainly received your much-desired letters. I am expecting definite news from Italy about the council at any moment; I will share it once I have received it. The Emperor is preparing with great pomp against the French; his motto "further beyond" breathes from his corrupted entrails. Would that the king and the most powerful kingdom turn to the Lord, so that the spilled blood is not avenged. If you have anything, please inform me diligently. Farewell forever. ZÃ¼rich, 15th of October, 1551.</p>
