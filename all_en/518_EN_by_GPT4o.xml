      <p>Camillo Renato to Heinrich Bullinger, Greetings in Christ.</p>
      <p>In my recent letter to you, I asked that if you had any interest in charity, you would let me know by letter in what matters you considered me the most heretical of all; for Franciszek Stankar said that you called me by that name.</p>
      <p>Francesco Negro, who delivered my letter to you, reported that you were unable to reply due to your occupations, but that you would certainly respond when you had time.</p>
      <p>However, I have not yet received any letters from you. This omission (unless I am mistaken) indicates that you either neglect or have despaired of a brother's well-being. If this is the case, which I certainly hope it is not, you seem to have had no regard for our old friendship and your own dignity. But what the law of friendship and your dignity required, you yourself must see. I certainly would have preferred that both were preserved by mutual duties rather than undermined by the perversity of certain people. If you had cared for this as much as I did, neither would you have had reason to remain silent for so long, nor would I have had reason to complain to you. But let it be, the slanders of some malevolent and envious person have prevailed with you more than the consideration of duty and the dignity of both of us: yet Christian charity, if it exists in you, should have compelled you to admonish me of my errors, if there were any, whom you ought to have loved not only as a friend but also as a brother and a beloved Christian man. In that way, I would have thanked you for your duty and fully satisfied you regarding the errors. Therefore, although both have been omitted, I still request or, if it is fair, I beg you to finally write to me about what matters you consider me most heretical.</p>
      <p>In this way, I will judge you both as a friend and as a Christian man. Farewell and love me as a Christian.</p>
      <p>On the 12th day of May, in Chiavenna, 1549.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, a man both most learned and pious.</p>
