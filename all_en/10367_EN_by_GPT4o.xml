    <p xml:id="regest1">Confirms that the deception of the French king is disturbing Germany. Schwenckfeld, who was received almost like a deity in Memmingen, clears himself of accusations with Gervasius Schuler and Simprecht Schenck, is angry with Blarer for his warnings about him, and deceives many people. Requests to urge Schuler to be vigilant and to find out what Leo Jud has written about Schwenckfeld. Schwenckfeld, with an alleged letter to Blarer, makes many people believe he has silenced him. With Schuler and others, Schwenckfeld has discussed the Trinity, the incarnation, and the glorified body of Christ. He teaches Christ's divinity after the ascension, the word-becoming of the flesh, Christ's suffering according to both natures, and baptism as a sign of Christian confession. He claims that he receives his teachings from Scripture and direct revelation. As soon as he answers Schuler's letter, he will send it. Greetings.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>It is as you write, most honorable Bullinger: The deception of the most cunning and treacherous French king will greatly disturb all of our Germany, but more on that another time.</p>
      <p>I can say nothing except this one thing, that Caspar Schwenckfeld was magnificently received in Memmingen by the consuls and others, to whom he sold his masked sanctity so well that they believed a divine being had descended to him from heaven. He cleared himself of many accusations with our Gervasius and Simprecht, which he claimed I had imposed on him, being very angry with me for warning several churches not to have too much faith in that seemingly holy and eloquent man. Many have written to me anxiously from there, urging me not to continue in this manner. They say Schwenckfeld is a good and truly holy man, whose entire life and doctrine reflect Christ, worthy of being observed and adored by all Christians. He has so deluded these simple and good people that I must now work hard and write much to remove him from their minds. I wish that this would succeed as happily as I strive to unmask the hypocrite. You must constantly and fervently pray to the Lord that He may soon free His church from this utterly destructive plague. Urge Gervasius to be diligent and vigilant here, lest this dangerous wolf, who is not very prudent, cause trouble for the sheep of Christ, which I will never cease to do to the best of my ability.</p>
      <p>Schwenckfeld received letters from Leo. You must diligently inquire from Leo what he wrote to him. For he did not want anyone in Memmingen to read them. Once you find out from Leo, inform me about it. Schwenckfeld boasts everywhere in all the churches that he has sent me some letters, although he has never written even a word to me. Meanwhile, he reads out a copy of those letters to everyone, so they believe he has silenced me.</p>
      <p>He discussed with Gervasius and other ministers of the word about the Trinity, the separation of persons in the divine, the incarnation, the condition of the glorified body of Christ, among which also these: "1. The Lord Jesus Christ has laid down all creaturely being through the cross and suffering, so that now according to human nature after his ascension he ceases to be called a creature. 2. After the ascension, Christ has become exactly what God was. 3. Not only has the word become flesh, but also the flesh has become what the word was, without mixing of natures. 4. The whole Christ according to both natures has suffered in the flesh," etc. He asserts that baptism is not a symbol of initiation, but of Christian profession. When some objected, he said: "Well, dear brothers, you might still learn all this. I have such things not only from Scripture but through the revelation of the Lord," etc. But he snatches the letter from the notary. Now I must respond to Gervasius's letter. Otherwise, I would have sent this one to you. But I will send it soon.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me, as you do. I greet all the saints.</p>
      <p>In Constance, March 11, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, venerable brother in Christ.</p>
