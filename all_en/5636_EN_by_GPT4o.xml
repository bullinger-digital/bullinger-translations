      <p>When this evening (reverend father in Christ) I received letters and others affirmed the same, but I did not have the time to transcribe these, I thought it best to send the original manuscript.</p>
      <p>I hope, however, that you are already well, so that there is no danger of bothering you with my letters.</p>
      <p>When Gorg Carlin was here and told me that the Cardinal of Trento was seized by madness (ertoubet) and two were bound in chains (he doubted, however, which one it was, the elder or the younger), behold, our chief judge was standing by, who today had business with the bishop in the name of the city, who likewise affirmed that the bishop had said the same things, and it was written to him even more, that the pope was half dead (thus the Italians say megmort), that is, half insensible, etc.</p>
      <p>These things suddenly in the dead of night.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ. March 9, 1563.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] F[abricius].</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
