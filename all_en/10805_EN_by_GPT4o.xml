    <p xml:id="regest1">The council representatives of the reformed cities have been invited to Basel to make a decision about the confession; Luther's opinion on it will likely become known via Strasbourg. Bullinger gifts Vadian his commentary on the last letters of Paul; for the 2nd letter to the Thessalonians, he has made an excursus on the Antichrist at Vadian's suggestion, and to the commentary on Titus, he has added explanations about the heretics, which [Valentin] Furtmüller and Dominik [Zili] should read. The Bernese are said to have set out to conquer the castle [Chillon]. An imperial request for mercenaries was rejected by Zurich; he asks for news about an alleged campaign to France.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You are not unaware, I believe, most illustrious man, that our people have been called to Basel again, namely to complete the business recently begun by us. Those who were previously delegates will go from our side. Our people are pleased with the confession in all respects. They wish to persist in this and have peace with all who confess the same or not contrary things. It did not seem necessary for us to be present at this convocation, nor have the Baselers now called the ministers of the word, but men of the senatorial order. Perhaps some other things necessary for preserving our church and republic will be discussed. I pray to the Lord to prosper what has been well begun and to close it with a favorable end. We may perhaps hear from the people of Strasbourg what Luther thinks of us and ours.</p>
      <p>I am sending what I have written on the last letters of Paul. If what I have published on the second letter to the Thessalonians will be useful to the pious, it will be entirely thanks to you; for if you had not urged more strictly that I paint these with their antichristian colors, I certainly would not have dealt with it so copiously. I have also added some things about restraining and punishing heretics to the letter to Titus, which perhaps it would be better to show either to Furtmüller or Dominik. However, I present this small gift to you and commend it to the Lord, in which may you fare well for a long time with yours.</p>
      <p>March 20, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The people of Bern are said to have set out again with 1500 men to storm and destroy a castle.</p>
      <p>The Emperor asked our people for soldiers, but they refused. What do you have about his expedition to France? For they say he is going to lead an army into France.</p>
      <p>To Doctor Joachim Vadian, his most esteemed lord.</p>
