      <p>God be with us, dearly beloved son, yesterday I wrote to you. Since then, a letter has arrived from Augsburg, confirming the same and stating that Maximilian has made his eldest son Rudolf king in Hungary, who is to be crowned in the coming August. He is said to have promised the Hungarians to restore to Hungary what has been alienated from it. A hard promise, perhaps also vain, unless it is bloody. The Duke of Alba is said to have brought several hundred troops into a besieged city, and those who were laying siege to it have been harmed. The Turk will undertake nothing on water this year, but on land, he is assembling a large force in Dalmatia and will soon march against the Venetians. The prices in Augsburg are rapidly decreasing.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Bavaria is lying ill. There is a rumor here, though uncertain, that the Duke of Savoy is dead and has appointed the King of Spain as the protector of his son, so that the Frenchman will not have a legitimate claim; for the young prince is the son of his father's sister, who is under guardianship. Oh, if he were now dead, who would be the administrator, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding luck, I have to say; since only 6 fish came to the market, I barely got 2 of them. I am sending them to your Susanna, so that she may host you with them. I preferred to send them to you uncooked, so that you may cook them as you like, and I am very glad that I was able to send them to you. Consider it good, and may God be with you eternally.</p>
      <p>Given on Saturday before Medardus, June 7, 1572. Our people and I greet you, etc. In haste.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
