    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Best wishes for the New Year, also to Myconius' wife [Margret] and the household members. In view of the present dangers, good wishes are needed!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The city of Ulm will not earn laurels for bravery, as it has allegedly reconciled quite easily with the "Sennacherib" [Emperor Charles V]! This is a confidential message. Nördlingen, Giengen, Bopfingen, Dinkelsbühl, Rothenburg ob der Tauber, and Schwäbisch Hall are in the hands of the Emperor. Bullinger is very worried about the scholar [Johannes] Brenz. Reutlingen and Esslingen are threatened due to the occupation of Weinsberg by the advancing Imperial forces [further south]. [The fortresses] Schorndorf and Asperg [near Stuttgart] are [still occupied by Duke Ulrich of Württemberg]. He fled on Tuesday [December 21] with 200 horses [southwards] to the [fortress] Hohentwiel [in the Hegau, near Constance]. Now the granary of the Confederation will be lost! But since it mostly sides with the Emperor and has shown itself submissive to the crow [of the Habsburg house], it deserves to be plundered by the raven [Charles V]. But God will protect His own!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The Zurich council has sent a [courier] [Melchior Vogel] with a letter to Duke Ulrich at Hohentwiel. In the letter, the people of Zurich, as friendly neighbors, inquire about the state of affairs. The courier will probably be back in Zurich tomorrow or on Monday [December 27].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] In the present misfortune, the people must be urged to pray and repent, for surely the Confederation will now also be threatened!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] What has Myconius learned about the Netherlands and France?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Yesterday, Bullinger waited in vain for [Francisco de] Enzinas, who was presumably held up by work. Greetings to him. Greetings also to [Johannes] Gast. He should send the wool with the current courier [...] if he has not already done so. Bullinger is still expecting a reply to his previous letter [No. 2721].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] [Below a later note added by Myconius:] It is reported from Constance that King [Christian III of] Denmark has marched against Duke Maurice [of Saxony] and killed many thousands of men.</p>

      <p>Friendly, beloved lord and brother, I wish you, your dear wife, and the entire household a good and prosperous year from God through our Lord. We indeed need this, as the situation is very precarious and dangerous. May Almighty God have mercy on us.</p>

      <p>Ulm will not earn much praise for bravery. It is rumored that they have easily reconciled with the Sennacherib; quod tibi dictum volo (which I want to tell you). Nördlingen, Giengen, Bopfingen, Dinkelsbühl, Rothenburg ob der Tauber, Schwäbisch Hall, and more have been taken by the Emperor! I am very anxious about the distinguished scholar Brenz. May Almighty God preserve him. Reutlingen and Esslingen are in danger, as Weinsberg and other places in Württemberg have already been taken by the Imperial forces. They are advancing. The land is terrified. Schorndorf, Asperg, etc., are occupied. The Duke fled on Tuesday with 200 horses to Hohentwiel. I fear it is over for our granary! And it would be just for us Confederates, as most places favor the Emperor. Therefore, we expect the raven to plunder us, as we are so fond of the black crow. But God will nonetheless protect His own. To Him alone belongs the victory.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>My lords have today sent a messenger. He is to travel day and night to Hohentwiel. A letter was written to the Duke, explaining the situation; therefore, they desire a response from him as loyal neighbors, etc. They expect the messenger to be back here tomorrow or on Monday.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>It is our duty in such calamities to exhort the people to constant prayer and repentance. Surely, surely this evil will also find us!</p>

      <p>Dear friend, what have you heard from the Netherlands and France?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Greet Dr. Dryander for me, whom I expected yesterday (but I can imagine he was busy). I wish him many good years, and also Dr. Gast. Share this with them. Send my regards to Gast, asking him on my behalf to send me the wool with this messenger if he has bought it and not yet sent it. I have not yet received a reply to my first letter. God be with you all. Given on the holy day of the birth of our Lord Christ, in the year 1547, at 5 o'clock in the afternoon. H. Bullinger.</p>
