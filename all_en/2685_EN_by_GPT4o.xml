      <p>S. D. I received your last letter, dearest compater in the Lord, on the 30th of the past month. What you write about the wickedness of the Lutherans had already become known to me to the point of nausea. There is nothing to marvel at in their unbridled and shameless desire to slander; they are not better instructed, they do not know how to bless, because they have so imbibed this slander from their teachers that curses flow from their mouths spontaneously, without prior thought. They believe they are fulfilling their duty well when they largely complete their sermons with invectives against the sacramentarians, as they call us. We must pray to the Lord to bring them back to a better mind. How differently should a minister of Christ be disposed? "Many things must be cared for," says Basil somewhere, "and many nights must be spent awake, and with many tears seek from God the truth that will cut the future brother to the heart."</p>
      <p>As for Matthäus Beyer, who delivers this, our lords have assigned him five florins with two measures of local grain for each quarter of the year.</p>
      <p>It is indeed a meager provision for the needs of one who is to bring four children with his wife; but what can we do?</p>
      <p>He came here not quite at the right time; our people are burdened with great expenses, especially in this season, hence they are more frugal than usual. Lord Haller is not present; it seems advisable to the others that he comes here; they hope that the present necessity will extort more.</p>
      <p>It remains that you there help the man with some travel expenses to us, since he does not have from his own means to satisfy the host. I gave him half a florin from my own, so that he may return to you more easily. We cannot, with a good conscience, abandon such people. Therefore, I beg you, dearest compater, to obtain from yours the travel allowance for him to come to us; when he comes here with his family, we will take over the rest of his care. Farewell excellently with all yours. May the lords and brothers, Mr. Pellican, Bibliander, Gwalther, Zwingli, your provost Haller, and the others be safe. The brothers and all mine greet you, especially your little Heinrich.</p>
      <p>Bern, 1555, August 2.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his dearest lord and compater. In Zürich.</p>
