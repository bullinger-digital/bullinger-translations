      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Dear Master Heinrich, Herr Peter's matter has been postponed until the next day, about which he will inform you himself. However, two honorable men from Zurzach have visited me, kindly asking you to assist in finding another preacher in Herr Peter's place until his matter is resolved. For (Because) the bailiff has remarked with these words: they may well look for another and appoint one, but they should not appoint a disreputable fellow. And it has been reported to Master Marx. He is a local from Glarus and a relative of the bailiff. They thought the bailiff would conduct himself more appropriately towards him than towards another. Therefore, I ask you to handle this matter in the best way possible for the sake of the honest people, as you have always done. Whatever further necessity requires, Peter will inform you about the matter. With this, I commend you to God.</p>
      <p>Johannes Winzürn, your willing servant in Wening.</p>
      <p>To the spiritual and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my dear father and lord, to his hands.</p>
