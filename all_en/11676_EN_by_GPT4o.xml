    <p xml:id="regest1">You have also seen Bullinger's letter to [Nikolaus Pfister, known as] Baling, in which Bullinger offers to write against the insensitive and godless atrocity of this man [Simon Lemnius], which he recently published; with Bullinger's authoritative voice, it will hopefully succeed in removing this disgraceful man from the [Chur] school, but keeping Nikolaus [Pfister]; otherwise, the existence of the school is at stake, as some communities are trying to divide the church properties among themselves; with Bullinger's help, the Reformation [in Graub√ºnden] was carried out, and with his help, they want to preserve it. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Johannes Blasius wishes grace, peace, and longevity of life from the Lord to the most illustrious Heinrich Bullinger, etc. We have also seen your letters, most learned and kind man, which you sent to our Baling (Nikolaus Pfister), in which you offer to write against the inhuman and godless atrocity of that man, which the most vain man recently dared to publish. You will certainly do something very necessary for our republic, and entirely pleasing to us, especially to me, to whom the care of our school has been entrusted so far, and who, with your authority, which holds much weight among our people, and with the work and help of other pious men, am considering expelling that impure writer from our college, but retaining our Nikolaus. Otherwise, I fear what has happened to our literary school, since some churches of our Federation are attempting to divide those good ecclesiastical properties among themselves. Therefore, most esteemed brother, do as you are accustomed to do, coming to the aid of all the churches of Christ by imitating Zwingli, indeed the apostle Paul: "Who is weak, and I am not weak?" etc. For partly through your help, we have obtained this reformation from our leaders, and with the same, if it is the Lord's will, we will preserve it. Farewell. I did not want to trouble you, occupied with your most pious labors, with more; for you, endowed with singular prudence, already understand our business and kindly consider my foolishness, and again farewell through the Lord, who may deign to preserve you unharmed for a long time for his churches, amen. Chur, 24th of May, in the year 1542. At the church of Saint Regula, your brother from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and illustrious man Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy bishop of the church of Zurich.</p>
