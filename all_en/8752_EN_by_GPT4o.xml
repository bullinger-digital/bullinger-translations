      <p>I recently wrote about what was accomplished in these subcommittees. But I wish I had written everything truthfully and that it was not necessary to use such a bitter addition now! Not only has Guiccardi's ability to present his case beneficial to the churches to the communities been taken away, but also by making a comparison for the benefit of the Rhaetian, Guiccardi is belittled, while others are boastfully praised. Also, it is stated in the diploma and decree that the Rhaetian is entirely ready to abandon that provostship, of which he will have no regard in the future; meanwhile, he anxiously ensured that a few were called together, whom he (except for four) made all so flexible and gracious or benevolent to him in almost a single moment, that in promulgating the edict they strongly urge the communities to carefully consider whether they want to hand over that provostship to the Rhaetian lord, leave it to Guiccardi, or assign it to neither, but claim it for the public treasury. Behold, that is entirely abandoning the provostship, that is, for the most part, handing it over to this one, who according to the tenor and argument of the two bulls, would restore superstitions with these means and finally, with the Italian ministers expelled and the usual subsidies withdrawn, either open a school for the Jesuits or transfer these revenues, converted by public instruments for sacred and evangelical uses, to profane uses and accommodate them for feeding horses or supporting drones. We want this to be ratified. And so that we ministers are not even allowed to whisper against such cunning and frivolous matters, those minute committees have most severely decreed that if either an evangelical minister or a papist priest should do or say anything against it or become authors of disturbances, new committees would be convened at their expense and they would be severely fined according to the gravity of the matter or offense. But what they call disturbances, we think no good person is unaware: namely, to speak the truth and indicate the danger. This matter was agitated among them by so many that I do not believe in vain that those committees were convened solely for this reason, to shut our mouths with the establishment of a penalty. For they wanted to command that we should not make any mention of this matter either by speaking or writing to anyone. Having learned this, we addressed the senate of this city: since it had already inflamed us and requested that we should not fail in our duty in such an arduous matter, whether it has relaxed anything of that opinion, or what advice it gives us in such a case, let it declare; for we cannot hope that it will now be the destroyer of its own counsel; indeed, we acknowledge that the holy magistrate is a constitution of God, to which every soul should be subject; but meanwhile, the efficient cause of this order reserves greater right to itself and to that extent, obedience to Caesar is required, as long as nothing of obedience to God is diminished, which the divine Peter observed in his time and place, when he said that more obedience should be rendered to God than to men. We received a correct and Christian response from the senate, as it asked us and strongly urged us not to yield, but by proceeding to free our souls. Which indeed we did more courageously, thus we convened a meeting of the brothers on January 15 in Maienfeld, where about 16 of us gathered in the Lord concluded that each one should diligently impress upon his flock what damage, what danger threatens the otherwise afflicted Italian churches if that provostship, alienated from true use by superstitions, should be ceded; also, as far as the Roman bulls are concerned, they should not dissemble, but modestly propose everything and not sow occasions for disturbances, but denounce seditions and, as much as is in them, restrain them by execration; thus not only will we free our souls, but also satisfy the people, who, full of suspicions, have long accused us of infidelity, who wish to cover and obscure such a matter, of which we have exact knowledge, for the favor of the magnates, from which not a small danger could arise for the churches and the whole country in the future. Having returned home again, we are immediately followed by the son of Captain Rodolphi von Salis, whose brother is Baptista von Salis, a knight with a bull, asking us to spare those knights with bulls; for there is not enough reason to measure those knights with bulls and the bulls of the Rhaetian with the same measure. He fears that the people, incited by us, will tear off those honorary chains and titles from them, etc. We replied that we cannot infringe the well-established statutes of the common assembly nor recall our letters once sent; nothing is to be feared from us, who dissuade them in every way and hope for nothing but peace and the free course of truth, which some friends of the pope and sworn satellites strive to impede and entangle.</p>
      <p>On the next Sunday, which will be January 27, popular votes will be collected almost everywhere throughout Rhaetia, by which that matter will be referred back to the assembly of Paul by response. But what I truly hope for from it, I will not hesitate to declare. The Planta family has labored so much for that cause that I have completely despaired of the provostship.</p>
      <p>Thus indeed many have united their minds, that after gaining victory, they will also attack us ministers, intending to accuse us of transgressing the mandate of the lords. It will be a strange and ill-omened tragedy, and there will be few who, being in office, will either want or be able to defend us. You will soon hear that I was a prophet here, and I will indeed experience it. I do not wish to trouble you with more here, as it is scarcely safe to set foot outside the house, given the danger to life; thus, the embittered Italians and those Planta people are attempting everything that will ultimately result in harm to me and eventually in my expulsion. But what should we do? If we speak, we will be troublemakers; if we remain silent, are we not traitors? I write these things to you in more detail, my most reverend lord father, so that you may finally, having compassion on me, examine with fatherly care the danger I am in, among whom I waste both oil and effort, and with what great difficulties I am now in my sixth year, since I was again sent to this Rhaetia.</p>
      <p>"I do not wish to withdraw from the battle line, but only to change my station and place." It is affirmed here for certain that the bishop, who acted as an orator to the Turk in the name of our brother legate, was beheaded by the very head, because the emperor suspected that he had deliberately reported the Venetian fleet to be weaker than he himself had experienced in defeat. It is also written for certain from Italy that the Turk has taken possession of the entire island of Cyprus and that the fortress of Famagusta, as they call it, was received by the Turk through surrender, and that he was treacherous towards those who surrendered, not only having all the soldiers in the garrison slaughtered against the given faith, but also having Nestor Balione, the leader, first mutilated by cutting off his ears and nose and thus paraded through the entire city as a spectacle, then finally skinned alive and killed with utmost cruelty. Nestor Martinengo, the younger brother of our count Ulysses, alone escaped the cruel hands of the enemies and returned to his own in an admirable and incredible manner. Meanwhile, the Venetians do not cease to rage against the pious, swollen with pride over the recently lost victory, of which either no or very little benefit reached them, while the pope and the Spaniard drew either the whole or a much larger part of the spoils to themselves.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Venetians, scarcely daring to whisper, having lost Cyprus and endured unspeakable expenses, seem to be paying the penalty for the cruelty they exercise against true Christians for the pope's favor. For in Bergamo, in recent days, a certain Marcus Giobia, called for the cause of religion, could not be freed by the letters of the Praegallians, of whom he is a citizen, to such an extent that the praetor of that place did not even deign to receive, much less read, the letters. Thus gradually that Ausonian robber invades and strangles one after another, etc., all of which we were supposed to keep silent about if we wished to fully comply with human constitutions.</p>
      <p>In the year 1572, January 21.</p>
