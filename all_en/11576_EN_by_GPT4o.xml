    <p xml:id="regest1">Has consulted with representatives of the authorities about the question [of Gwalther's stay in Regensburg]; if the Prince [Philip of Hesse] departs and Gwalther's living expenses therefore increase, he should return and try to keep himself informed through the people of Constance. He should bring a letter from the Prince to the Zurich council. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have presented your question to the council, the treasurers, the mayor, and the tribune of the people, and sought their advice. It pleases everyone that you should stay as long as the most illustrious prince remains and you can stay at his court as you have until now; but when he departs, and you have to live at your own expense, return home immediately. For it is not worth incurring heavy expenses for something of no value, as you wisely judge. However, if you can make trustworthy acquaintances with reliable people, as has been assured to you by the people of Constance, do so.</p>
      <p>I would wish that you bring the letters written by the prince to the senate. Greet the preachers of the most illustrious prince and the most beloved brothers in Constance and Ulm.</p>
      <p>Farewell and return if the prince departs. June 15, 1541.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Rudolf Gwalther of Zurich, residing in Regensburg or at the court of the most illustrious Prince of Hesse or with the people of Constance, his son.</p>
