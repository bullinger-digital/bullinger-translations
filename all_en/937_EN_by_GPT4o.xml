      <p>Greetings. Your most honorable council has responded to our council not only wisely but also piously and amicably. However, this troublesome dissension among the ministers persists no less than ever before; for those who preside over our churches (except for one, Sertorius) do not yield in the slightest to the council, and now, having received the letters, they are much more eager to hold onto their opinion than they were before. Therefore, I believe it will be your duty to prepare yourself to persuade and mitigate the excessive obstinacy of some and to do what you can with your exceptional learning, which indeed in this case can contribute to the common understanding of our people. For unless you assist us particularly in this matter, I have nothing to promise myself either about concord or any clearing of consciences, and I foresee some danger in the delay itself, while they are suspended against each other with such hostile minds and do not cease to devise one plan after another, by which they can promise themselves more about victory. Therefore, Bullinger, my best, I both beg and beseech you in my name and in the name of my council, to do what you can, so that the matter may be brought to clarity, and we may finally be freed from these disturbances. Indeed, no hope can be placed in me for procuring concord, because I have openly opposed Fortmüller; for he admits no one here who deals with me a little more familiarly.</p>
      <p>We need the club of Hercules, by which Anthleus may finally be defeated. Farewell. St. Gallen, June 15, 1550.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most honorable church of Zürich, my most esteemed lord.</p>
