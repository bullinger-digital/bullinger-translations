      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear friend. We are sending you herewith some recent news that has been sent to us in recent days, which you, after reading them, should return to us and let us have them back etc. As we have previously graciously requested and written to you, we would like to receive and send some of those treatises (How far a Christian is obliged to suffer authority etc.), we would be pleased if you did not forget or neglect to do so, as we graciously expect from you. Dated the 30th of January in the year etc. 52.</p>
