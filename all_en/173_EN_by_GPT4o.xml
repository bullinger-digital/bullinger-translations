      <p>In greatest haste. Received your letter, thank you for the Christian admonition; helping with heart and earnestness to ask the Lord for such a spirit, who willingly suffers and bears everything for His sake, as I am then completely comforted, He will in great cross much and great strength and power in our weakness show. Otherwise, you know well how the common people are minded.</p>
      <p>Schertle, I say, has done himself harm. The Emperor has now captured his most secret servant in Augsburg, from whom he can learn everything. It is to be feared that he will not have much more for his Fürtenbach. If he now lets himself be used against the English, I fear badly, he has already seen his luck at the bottom.</p>
      <p>That great man, about whom you write, even if he is three times great, has nevertheless written in vain, as far as our Bucer is concerned, who, I do not doubt, will be tortured a thousand times sooner than admit that execrable disgrace. But how true this is, the matter itself will soon teach.</p>
      <p>The people of Lindau, as well as those of Memmingen, have sent their envoys to the Emperor, to whom they frankly confess that they cannot in any way depart from their confession of faith; some other cities, before they indicated this, thought to present a supplication to the Emperor, but thereby obtained nothing but greater indignation from the Emperor.</p>
      <p>What will happen next, we will expect hourly to hear from our people. I have no doubt at all that the Emperor will lose all the success of his efforts once and for all, since he does not hesitate to use force against the divine will.</p>
      <p>The people of Reutlingen, except for a few of the common people and nine men of both councils, have accepted that unfortunate Interim, themselves much more unfortunate. The people of Esslingen are still deliberating, but much weakened, so that there is danger if the Emperor presses a second time, they too will accept. The people of Ravensburg are held in such straits, that nothing more; so much so that that abbot, the excrement of our family, causes them one trouble after another and adds oil to a fire already burning more than enough.</p>
      <p>They are forced to defile the cleansed temples again and restore the priests; perhaps there will be no place or evangelist left destined to preach the word of Christ.</p>
      <p>Now I receive letters from Schnepf, who writes among other things: "I do not doubt that my prince will steadfastly confess Christ, even if it were to happen that the papal idolatry were forced upon the duchy. About the Emperor's book, Philippus now says these words to me: "And now," he says, "a new [Greek] of great confusions or even wars is approaching, the publication of the imperial book on doctrine, in which partly sophisms are contained, partly a clear confirmation of depraved cults.</p>
      <p>Know, he says, "by the grace of God, the word of the gospel still sounds in our church and we, with God's help, will modestly and gravely publish our opinion about that book, and this will be done by good and learned men, even if I am intercepted or oppressed." He added in the letter this: "Naples has not yet obtained peace." So far Philippus. This word clearly indicates that this will be a different opinion than the one that was not to be published, but whispered into Maurice's ear. After many things, Schnepf writes thus: "Reutlingen would have suffered something from some impostors, although I do not yet have anything certain about it. Many citizens there were deceived by a most slanderous lie, by which some [Greek] ministers of Reutlingen, with a false defection fabricated, almost overthrew some citizens; but the lie was exposed, and the whole city knows that it has been surrounded by lies. Therefore, I hope that this slander will someday rebound on the heads of the authors, unless they repent, which I sincerely wish for them." This Schnepf, with whose words he somewhat refreshed the sick mind, into which I fell from another message brought from Esslingen, especially since his letter was given two days after the other, besides Reutlingen is less distant from Tübingen than from Esslingen, so that the people of Tübingen can know more certain things about it than those of Esslingen.</p>
      <p>Now comes writing from our envoys; I perceive well that it is prickly and very worrying everywhere; I do not actually know how it is on our side, except that they remain on the previous articles and want to have an answer very soon.</p>
      <p>The Emperor hurries excellently with everyone, only with Strasbourg he does very slowly. Towards Nuremberg, he has dispatched the one from Lier and Doctor Hasen, and the two electors of Brandenburg and the Palatinate have also ridden along; wanting to deal with all the Interim with counsel and community. May Almighty God give grace and strength everywhere, that some loyalty may remain!</p>
      <p>Those from Hall have resisted; the Emperor immediately placed the troops that were in Heilbronn into the city and forced them to accept, likewise those from Heilbronn.</p>
      <p>Biberach and Reutlingen are also said to be almost over. Augsburg has given an answer; the Emperor will not be satisfied with it.</p>
      <p>Ulm is also still hanging, likewise other cities; but the Emperor presses and hurries fiercely. God have mercy on His own! It is the time of trial and purification.</p>
      <p>The Lord will cleanse His threshing floor. Oh, may He give grace and patience, that we may yet make a glorious stand. I cannot write more to you this time. There are so many affairs and so much to write and do, that I would need many hands and heads. Praying, praying, praying for us, do not cease; for this cross will hatch many strange eggs, where before little was known what was inside.</p>
      <p>Given in greatest haste on June 27, 1548.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In Zurich.</p>
