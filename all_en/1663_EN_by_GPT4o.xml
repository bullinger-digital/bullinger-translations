      <p> Greetings. I have nothing at all to write about our affairs, except that we are all in good health. We are surprised that Artopoeus is delaying so long among the Rhaetians. Musculus's newborn child has died. </p>
      <p> My wife's stepfather has come from Lorraine, who says that many towns occupied by the French are again defecting and that a new army is to be led into these parts by the French, which will destroy everything. We hear absolutely nothing about Maurice and the princes, nor about the Nurembergers, except that they have been defeated by the margrave. </p>
      <p> Write, I beg you, if you have anything. Otto Heinrich has called Musculus and Blaurer to restore the churches of his domain. Musculus has gone to Biel to Blaurer, and after consulting together, both have declined the invitation with a joint response, one intent on Augsburg, the other on his Constance. </p>
      <p> These are the things I have. The envoys to Baden are Hagius and Pastor Pandareta, both. My whole family and Musculus also send their greetings to you. May all yours be safe. Hastily, Bern, June 23, 1552. </p>
      <p> Yours, Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and compatriot. </p>
      <p> Zurich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. </p>
