    <p xml:id="regest1">The [towards Capito] doubts expressed in confidence about the usefulness of a convent are no reason to accuse him of disloyalty; Bucer cannot rely on a previously given promise if he wants to divert the people of Zurich from their doctrine of the Lord's Supper against their conscience in order to achieve agreement with Luther. Friends should not confront each other with previous letters; this applies to the still existing letters [of the Strasbourg people] to Zwingli as well as to Bullinger's conditional approval of Bucer's book "Ad Monasterienses", which, although it corresponds in many respects to Zwingli's doctrine, also contains unacceptable concessions. Urges Bucer to justice and forgives him for his harsh writing.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Indeed, my faith has been most sacred until now, dearest Bucer in the Lord, and it has always seemed ungenerous to me if it is not fulfilled without the disgrace of God and the detriment of our neighbor. Now, however, since I feared for many reasons that more discord and contention would arise from the convent than charity and peace, I wrote, with good counsel, God is my witness, that I do not see what benefit is to be hoped for from the convent. That is indeed my so-called treachery, of which I am accused. For I do not have copies of my written letters. I have written with a secure mind until now and never thought it would happen that any account or mention would have to be made of what I had written. I wrote as a friend and poured out my feelings into his bosom; but now, when I am reproached for treachery, I understand what danger sometimes arises from letters written a little too confidently or imprudently. Now if a friend had promised something to a friend in familiar letters or by oath, which he later regretted, as he saw that his promise was very harmful and of little benefit, could the candor of a friend insist on that given faith more wickedly? I know what you aim for with that convent, namely that we speak differently than we have so far about the presence of the body of Christ in the supper, so that we may return to concord with Luther. But we cannot speak differently about this mystery with a clear conscience than we have always spoken. If Luther indeed feels what you say he feels, there is no need for us to meet. For we already accept and tolerate him. If he does not feel this, we will by no means agree with him, yet we will bear with him, provided he tolerates us. If you consider my mind and intention, you will not accuse me of treachery by any right. Your letters to our Zwingli still exist, but far be it from us to misuse them to the disgrace of your name. I have always believed that good friends' letters could be improved. Thus, in another letter, I explained on what occasion I wrote that I approve of your disputation on the sacraments in the booklet [Ad] Monasterien[ses]. You know what suspicion troubled us. Several letters written to you testify to this. We thought you had defected to Luther's side. But when I saw what you wrote in this: that bread is called the body as a royal scepter is called a kingdom, keys are called power, grace is not bound to the sacraments, the impious participate in the sign, not in reality, etc., you completely satisfied my mind and freed me from all suspicion. I subscribe to the same even today. Zwingli always felt the same. However, because you later proposed certain things more obscurely and ambiguously on the same subject, I attributed it to the pursuit of concord, and even today I overlook them to obtain better things, although there are things that I do not entirely approve of. And I will not use this manner of speaking in our church. For we must not only consider the Saxon churches but also our own. Therefore, I beg you, my brother, to treat ours more fairly and candidly. For I could not disagree with you unless provoked by many injuries. Now, if you have written anything more harshly, do not reproach me much with charity, I forgive you and wish you well.</p>
      <p>January 10, 1536.</p>
      <p>H. Bull.</p>
      <p>To Lord Martin Bucer, dearest brother, to his own hands.</p>
