    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer forwarded the letter from Bullinger intended for Vadian [not received] the day before yesterday, along with his treatise "Contra scandala ex bello infeliciter gesto oborta Apologia". He can only approve of such a writing and is grateful that Bullinger sent it to him. Especially in these dangerous end times, even God's children rely on the comfort drawn from the Holy Scriptures and Christian history books to not lose courage. By composing such writings, Bullinger, who is particularly gifted for this, deserves great praise. May the Lord preserve this extraordinary gift in him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Blarer has not yet been able to send the illustration [of the Glarus celestial phenomenon] to Vadian, as he sent it to someone else [...] for viewing and has not yet received it back. He will forward it to Vadian as soon as possible. Blarer would also like to have a Daniel who can reveal God's plans! He himself does not permit himself to judge it and prefers to listen to the opinion of people like Bullinger. It is certain that the meaning of this phenomenon will be revealed through the coming events.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Enclosed is a letter from Hans Schöner's sister [Sabina], the pious nun. It includes a gold coin intended for Bullinger's wife Anna [née Adlischwyler], with which Sabina wishes to express her gratitude. Bullinger should return the letter that the Augsburg council wrote to him and Blarer regarding Schöner's matter, so that it can also be communicated to Sabina. Unfortunately, from this and Georg Frölich's letter, it becomes clear that there is no longer any hope for the elderly Schöner. May the Lord be with him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] A letter from Augsburg arrived last night. They are expecting the return of Emperor Charles V from Munich daily, although some people believe he will move elsewhere. The English are said to have killed 10,000 men of King Henry II of France. Pope Paul III is said to be extremely angry about the murder of his son Pier Luigi Farnese and is recruiting many soldiers. In Augsburg, more and more people are dying from the plague.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Landgrave Philip of Hesse is still imprisoned in Donauwörth and is being treated poorly. Some believe that the Emperor would have already disposed of him if he had not made great concessions to Duke Maurice of Saxony.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Elector John Frederick of Saxony enjoys high esteem among the Spaniards and many others. He is likely to be released during this Diet. They are expecting the arrival of King Ferdinand daily, after he has raged everywhere in Bohemia. The Elector's preacher [Christoph Hoffmann] is no longer allowed to preach publicly because he had too large a following. However, he may continue to do so in the Elector's residence and say what he wishes.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Otherwise, preaching in Augsburg continues as before. The righteous inhabitants complain about the foreigners in the city who behave badly. Recently, a city mercenary [...] was strangled in front of the city gate, and another man [...] was fatally injured.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] According to reports from some people, the people of Constance have incurred the Emperor's displeasure. Therefore, they have no choice but to patiently await God's will. May the Lord give the strength to endure everything and the grace to enter the kingdom of heaven.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Greetings to Bullinger's household, colleagues, and friends, also from Blarer's brother Thomas and from Konrad Zwick.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] [P.S.:] Bullinger should return the letters from Sabina Schöner and the Augsburg council. He should also provide advisory support to the young letter carrier Johannes [...] who has been recommended to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] [Enclosure:] News [from an unknown person] from Augsburg dated September 23:</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] The Emperor, King Ferdinand, and Queen Maria of Hungary rode to Munich on September 20 for hunting and pleasure and are expected to return soon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Apart from some preparations, there have been hardly any noteworthy negotiations at the Diet so far.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] The secular princes are expected to arrive in Augsburg around Michaelmas [September 29]. So far, only Duke William IV of Bavaria is present. The Duchess of Lorraine, Christina of Denmark, is also expected to arrive soon. What do these women want at the Diet?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] Currently, secret agreements are being made between Prince Maximilian and the councils of King Ferdinand. The aim is to obtain the King's approval on some matters. The Spaniards are particularly courting Baron Johann Hoffmann, the King's chief steward, to whom they pay almost more attention than to his lord! More will be known about this soon. It is certain that the Imperialists will maintain decorum and not offend any high-ranking individuals until they have enforced the Emperor's will. May God grant improvement!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] As previously reported, [the Protestants] in Augsburg are still allowed to attend sermons and practice their church customs. May it remain so!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] Everything is becoming more expensive because the city is full of people, and more are arriving daily. This is an enormous burden for the residents. The foreigners do not set a good example for the youth, so that this Diet, like the previous one [of 1530], will have long-lasting detrimental effects. [The unknown reporter] also has much to complain about. However, he must adapt to the situation and exercise patience. Others have to endure even more. There are daily assaults, and one must always be careful that the many children of honorable citizens do not come into contact with primitive people!</p>

      <p>S. Three days ago, I gave your letter to our Vadian along with that apologetic oration, which I greatly approve of, and for which I thank you very much for sharing it with me. In these last days, the comfort of the scriptures and the history of early Christianity is and will always be necessary for the good children of God, so that they do not lose heart amidst so many offenses from the right and the left. In this matter, we rightly praise you, my Bullinger, as particularly blessed, for you excel greatly in this, as in many other things. May the Lord protect His gifts in you!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I was unable to send the illustration to Vadian because the person to whom I sent it for viewing has not yet returned it. I will send it as soon as I receive it. I also long for a Daniel who can interpret God's will for us. I do not presume to take anything upon myself here, and I will respectfully listen to your opinion and that of others like you. I believe the events themselves will be the most certain narrators of all these things. May the Lord turn it for the good!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I am sending a letter from the most pious nun, the sister of our Schöner, along with a gold coin, which she gives to your wife, so that you may understand her willingness to gratify you. I ask you to send me a copy of the letters that the Augsburg council sent to us regarding Schöner's case, so that I can ensure it is returned to this good woman as she requested. I am deeply sorry for the afflicted old man, but there is no hope from anywhere that I can confidently help him! The letters from the Augsburgers and Lęti have left me with nothing, but the Lord will provide him with what he needs, for the earth and its fullness are His.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>From Augsburg last night: They are expecting the Emperor's return from Munich daily, although some think he will take another route. England is said to have killed 10,000 of the French. The Pope is said to be making many soldiers and is very furious about his murdered son. Fire, lightning, thunder, and hail. The plague is beginning to cause significant deaths in Augsburg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The Landgrave is still in Donauwörth. He is being treated poorly. Some think the Emperor would have disposed of him quickly if he had not promised Duke Maurice too much on his behalf.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Elector of Saxony has great favor with the Spaniards and many others. It is thought he will be released during this Diet. They are expecting the King every day. He has accomplished everything in Bohemia. The Elector's preacher is no longer allowed to preach publicly in his lodging as before. The attendance was too large. But in the Elector's chamber, he may say or preach what he wishes for his person.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Otherwise, preaching in Augsburg continues as before. Pious people complain about the foreign guests. Things are going badly. The foreigners have recently strangled a city mercenary in front of the gate and fatally wounded another.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Some write that we are in great disgrace. Well, we must patiently await what God will do with us. May He give grace and patience, so that we may endure everything and reach the intended goal.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Given on October 4th. May your household be well with your brothers and friends. Our greetings to you, especially from my brother and Zwick. Yours, A. B.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Return Schöner's letter with the example of the Augsburg council's letters to us. I commend this young man, Johannes, to you very carefully, so that you may also assist him with your advice.</p>
      <p>To D. H. Bullinger, incomparable friend. Zurich.</p>

      <p>From Augsburg, etc., dated September 23:</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>On September 20, the Emperor, also the Roman King with Queen Maria, rode to Munich for hunting and leisure. They are expected to return soon.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Nothing special has been dealt with until this day, except that some preparations for future actions are being made.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Besides the Prince of Payer, no other secular prince has come here yet, but they are expected around Michaelmas. The Duchess of Lorraine is also expected to come soon. What this means with the women, one cannot know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>There is currently the greatest secret negotiation with the prince, especially with the King's councilors, to persuade the King on some matters. The Spaniards are excessively courting Lord Johann Hoffmann, the King's chief councilor. They almost never leave him. They follow him more than the King himself; but nothing to write about this. Time will soon reveal everything. It is certain that they will handle other matters very cautiously and will not want to offend anyone until they have achieved their will in the matters that are most pressing for the Emperor at this time. May God grant a good end to a not good beginning!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>With our preaching and church exercises, everything remains the same as I wrote to you before. May God grant and give that we may continue as we have so far!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>I have nothing special to write to you, except that there are many and great people here, which increases daily, and therefore everything is becoming very expensive. It is truly very burdensome and ruinous for the common man. Our young people have many bad examples, so that our city will not overcome the previous and current Diet for a long time. I have much to complain about. I must restrain myself, and when I think of those who are much more oppressed than I am, I am rightly patient. There are many small quarrels daily from unruly people. One must always be on guard, as is usual, where so many and various children of honorable people are together.</p>
