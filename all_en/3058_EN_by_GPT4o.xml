      <p>To Mr. Konrad Klauser, schoolmaster in Brugg, greetings.</p>
      <p>Mr. Klauser, since you have written not only to me but also involved other preachers, my colleagues, in the matter you are pursuing with me through letters, I could not help but share your letters with them as well. They have never lent too open an ear to your or others' informers. Therefore, you accuse us unjustly of a fault that we all abhor as most foul, knowing that one should not believe lightly or anyone. However, no one has reported or accused you to us, nor has any of us reported or accused you or your matters to anyone, much less publicly attacked your writings with strange insults. Therefore, consider, Mr. Klauser, who lends a kind ear to informers, and weigh with what minds we could receive what you associate us with, whom you repeatedly call your Judas and betrayer.</p>
      <p>We are completely ignorant of what business you have with Mr. Peter Schnyder, and therefore we should neither accuse nor excuse it. So far, we have regarded Mr. Peter as a brother and a faithful minister of the church, and we are deeply grieved that you are so separated, indeed hatefully opposed, when you ought to have been most amicably united. We do not at all believe that Mr. Peter made us the authors of the matter you charge him with, as if he did what you say he did at our instigation. Some of us have never seen your book; those who have seen it and tasted some parts of it rather than read it, have not attacked it with any insults, unless it seems an insult to you that I, not to dissemble anything in my mind, said without any intention of insulting, that I envy you for having discussed so much about military matters, a profession most alien to you, among the Sualbachians, the most skilled in military affairs, lest perhaps the critics of our works should retort upon you what Cicero [Cic. de orat, Z, 75] says Hannibal did to Phormio the Peripatetic, and that I would prefer, if war is to be waged against the Turks, that other nations renowned in war be joined with the Germans rather than the Germans alone be committed against the most powerful enemy. Therefore, none of us has inflicted any injury upon you, whence it would have been much wiser for you to have withheld those bitter letters of yours and not to have dealt with your friends and benefactors as with enemies and those who have wronged you.</p>
      <p>You now know, Mr. Klauser, what you so greatly desired to know and what you added at the end of your letters with quite an authoritative tone: "Therefore, make sure I know as soon as possible; if this is not done and you do not clear yourselves to me, I will accuse you," etc. Rather, make sure that we know how we have sinned or are sinning in the use of ecclesiastical resources. For you threaten to come to Zürich and accuse us before the Zürich senate, and if you are not admitted, to publicly show how we Zürich churchmen use ecclesiastical goods. Indeed, you ought to have done this long ago.</p>
      <p>However, we do not refuse anything here even now. So far, we have expected nothing of this kind from you, as our friend and brother, nor from anyone else, as we are well aware of our good conscience in this matter. But since of your own accord, not provoked by us, without any fault or merit of ours, you offer yourself to this contest, we grant you the freedom to deal either with the most honorable senate of the city of Zürich, our most esteemed lords, or to freely converse with us; for we will listen to you kindly and discuss candidly.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zürich, December 4, in the year of our Lord 1556.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, in the name of all the preachers of the city of Zürich.</p>
