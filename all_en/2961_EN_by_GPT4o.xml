      <p>Greetings. From Italy, we hear absolutely nothing, except what has been said for several days now, as also with you, that the Pope is preparing to wage war against the Duke of Florence; what if he enlists soldiers under this title to be led elsewhere? In the Valtellina Valley, the heat of the sun has burned a large part of the grain and hay; they say almost the same about Italy.</p>
      <p>Regarding what you ask about the story or tale of the little priest among us, we have seen that publication and read that writing; all are false and fabricated, to briefly say what it is. Nothing of the sort has ever happened in our Confederation nor in neighboring regions. The three Confederations gathered a few weeks ago were very upset that the Imperialists so shamelessly spread and print such things about us or our people, and they wrote, I believe, to the judges at Innsbruck to complain about this. Everything else in our Confederation remains in its previous state. We had feared that the Swiss were not sufficiently united; but we are compelled to hope for better things, as all those coming from there bring good news. Farewell in the Lord, most excellent man. Tscherner greets your kindness; Consul Ambrosius is now in the Valtellina Valley; Father Comander also sends his greetings.</p>
      <p>From Chur, on the 7th of July, 1556.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours as always, Philipp Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all good people. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
