      <p>Greetings. I know that to you, a very busy man, an empty exchange of letters is unpleasant; yet, as Fabricius was setting out to you, I did not dare to send nothing in writing. What more is there that an eloquent man could not have expressed more articulately in this letter of mine? Certainly, my constant and singular love towards you, of which I seem to be the best interpreter with my conscience as my witness, and indeed I envy him not a little, who will be able to be present and enjoy your blessed conversations with the most learned men who are with you in Zürich, while I am left here with the Rhaetians under the knife, as they say. I have communicated some things to this trustworthy man, which I would scarcely have entrusted to a letter.</p>
      <p>If you have discovered anything deeper that would be to your advantage, please, let me know. I am eager to know what you hear about the Palatine.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man.</p>
      <p>Chur, May 8, 1565.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, P[omponne] de Bellièvre.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the Church of Zürich.</p>
