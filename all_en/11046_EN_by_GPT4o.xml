He did not seal the letter properly because he left his seal in Chur; however, a letter carrier now provides the opportunity to write.</p>

      <p>Philipp Gallicius to Heinrich Bullinger, Greetings.</p>
      <p>Although I am not known to you, most honorable and illustrious man, and therefore do not know how you will receive this letter of mine, perhaps untimely, certainly less elegant than what should come into your sight and hands, yet an innate force and characteristic in my mind, by which I regard and venerate all learned men as certain divinities sent from heaven to earth, has driven and compelled me, hesitating and reluctant for some time, to write to you and seek your favor in this modest way, until I can do so in a better manner. For it would not have been bold to have done this; for what fault would it be, even if I, a humble and supplicant man, have greeted a man of the highest standing in both learning and piety, if not with great magnificence, then certainly with a simple and sincere heart? Or would I have been too rash or audacious in daring to ask? But I will never regret having done this; for I am not ashamed, no, to have sought the friendship of you and those like you, that is, the best of men, whom good people strive to greet, seek, and win over. For in you all virtues are accumulated, as not I, but your most pious and learned works published in the light speak and testify. Whoever does not admire and praise them with full voice is either lazy and stupid or malicious and perverse: stupid indeed, who does not notice their excellence, malicious, I say, who, if he notices, does not follow with due praise, which you do not know whether they are delivered with greater learning and eloquence or with piety and faith. For indeed, by Hercules, in them contend both humanity and all-encompassing skill and that right and consummate disposition of mind, which we call faith. Nor do I say this because I think you, most excellent man, so imprudent and foolish as to be captivated by these words of praise and glory, even if true, who, I do not doubt, prefer the praises of your virtues to be in hearts rather than on tongues, but to show that I perceive the gifts of God, which are in you. Which you will hear as gladly as you rejoice that God, the giver of all good, and his gifts are recognized and proclaimed. For you understand how his virtues, who called us from darkness into light according to the word of the apostle Peter, are to be announced, of him, I say, who is the acting force and entelechy, as they say, working and perfecting all things in all, lest we arrogate anything to ourselves, blind as we are. But to finish: I pray, most illustrious and kind man, that you may love Philipp, your admirer, or if you do not wish this, at least know that he loves you and endure it. But since I know whom I am delaying here with my nonsense, farewell, most learned and pious man. In Malans, on the third day before the Nones of June, in the year 1537. The same, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>Do not worry that I have not sealed the letter properly; I left my seal in Chur to be better engraved at this fair; for I had not intended to write to you, but this messenger is opportune, etc. To the learned and pious man Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all the devout and studious. In Zurich, etc.</p>
