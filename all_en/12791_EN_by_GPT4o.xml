    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Since a reliable messenger is available to him, Frölich wants to add the following to his letter today [No. 2741]: Despite the uncertain situation, as far as Frölich can assess, the Augsburg council is absolutely against a capitulation to Emperor Charles V, unless they are forced to do so. However, the patricians want the opposite. This could lead to a confrontation. Frölich naturally sides with those who stand for the Gospel and for [German] freedom, even if the world were to perish as a result. May the Lord grant steadfastness! Of course, this will be difficult because Augsburg stands completely alone. Perhaps brave German [forces] will still come to the city's aid.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The Confederates should send a delegation to the Emperor and urge him to reach a settlement. He is still alive (even though he is very ill) and is in the Duchy of Württemberg. Duke [Ulrich] has not yet engaged with him. If only the Duke would receive comfort from the Swiss and remain steadfast!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. Although I wrote to you with very few words today, having found a reliable messenger, I wanted to add these small notes to the previous ones. Indeed, despite the situation being quite uncertain, as far as I can deduce, our council will absolutely not surrender this city to the enemy unless driven by extreme necessity. However, since the patricians (as they are called) strive for the opposite, I greatly fear that a conflict may arise. I have indeed decided to support those parties that aim to defend the truth of the Gospel and freedom, even if the world were to collapse. May the Lord graciously look upon the souls of the good and grant us faith and steadfastness in the Lord. The task will indeed be most difficult, as we are utterly devoid of human aid. If any strength and courage were to flourish in Germany, perhaps they would finally come to our aid in these extreme struggles.</p>

      <p>Your people should indeed now send envoys to the Emperor to negotiate a common settlement. The Emperor is still alive, and is currently in the Duchy of Württemberg, but he is very ill. Duke Württemberg has not yet made an agreement with him. Oh, if only he would receive consolation from the Swiss, so that he would not surrender!</p>

      <p>Farewell, my soul, very swiftly. January 6, 1547. Yours, Georg Frölich (Laetus), etc.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Zurich, etc., my beloved lord and brother, to be delivered in Zurich.</p>
