      <p>I received your letters, my most esteemed lord, along with two Decades of sermons, which are dearer to me than all gold and precious stones. I have not yet been able to read them thoroughly due to my affairs; however, I will read them and then intend to preach them from the pulpit; for indeed, they cannot but come from a chosen workshop, which are published by you. Therefore, I thank you as much as I can express in words and embrace in my mind. As for me, I have nothing to send you, due to my poverty, although I am indebted to you in so many ways, except perhaps what might trouble and distress your mind; but you will grant pardon for your kindness. I was very pleased with what you wrote about Saxony, Pomerania, and other regions, and finally about England.</p>
      <p>I had indeed heard some things, but to which I could hardly give credence, since in our time so many vain and false things are spread into the ears of men. Above all, however, I was most pleased to hear that your and our opinion about the Lord's Supper has prevailed in England, because it is true; there is indeed hope that it will prevail in other matters as well. Regarding our church, I have nothing to write to you that would bring you joy; the bearer of this letter will inform you of the state of our church.</p>
      <p>One thing is that those who were the cause of the schism are Anabaptists, and some of them, who also adhered to that man Camillus, in the presence of many listeners, while we were at the table of a certain nobleman, with Paolo Vergerio, an eminent man and bishop of Capodistria, who fled to us for fear of the Antichrist, present, confessed in a clear voice that he had recently received baptism and that having received it, he had been made another man, namely renewed and filled with the Spirit of God. He also renounced the Pope and all that he had received under the papacy, including baptism, because that baptism was not of Christ, but of the Antichrist and the devil; and he declared me to be a wolf, a false prophet, and a deceiver. Camillus, their leader and helmsman, is not so rash as to speak so openly; he is more prudent, not because he is not worse, but because he fears to speak, as I suppose; for they cannot, being so closely connected, not be entangled in the same errors. They were grieved that the one I mentioned was so rash as to utter such things; for they wish to be in hiding, so that their synagogue may grow and contaminate more people.</p>
      <p>I do not know what I will do: I have been called to England; for here there is no one to help me; I tread the winepress alone - forgive me, lord, for this is fitting only for Christ -, I am alone, I meant to say. May the Lord direct my steps; I am in need of counsel.</p>
      <p>I hear that Camillus is writing to you. Believe him as you, in your wisdom, will judge it should be believed.</p>
      <p>He is a plague of the churches and a great heretic. There is a rumor that he is preparing to leave Chiavenna: may he become better elsewhere! It is to be hoped that he will carry his plague with him; but I fear he will not take the remnants with him. The bearer of this letter is Balthasar Alterius, an eminent man of singular genius. You will hear him; for I cannot, in a brief writing and with the greatest haste, as you see, explain what he will convey to you. He will reveal his thoughts to you. You, a man of great wisdom, if you see that his matter is to promote the glory of Christ, help him with counsel and favor. As far as I can grasp with my little understanding, I believe that all his desires are most conducive to the propagation of (unless I am mistaken) the gospel of Christ; however, what he desires will be difficult for those in power to correspond with his plans.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus, our Lord, and pray for me. In Chiavenna, 15th of May, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Augustinus Mainardi, hastily.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zürich and his most esteemed lord. In Zürich.</p>
