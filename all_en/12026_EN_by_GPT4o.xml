      <p>Most illustrious man and my most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Your daughters Anna and Elisabeth, beautiful offspring, said after dinner that they would return to you tomorrow. Therefore, to renew our old friendship, I have decided to greet you with this letter, so that you may know that I am yours as usual, to whom you can command, and I will always obey and serve you, as I am bound and as befits our friendship, which I wish to preserve forever.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, a Burgundian envoy was about to come to the lords of Zurich regarding the neutrality of Burgundy. If he has come, I would gladly understand for your convenience upon the return of the people of Bremgarten from the festival being celebrated there.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new, except that mediators between the two warring majesties are working for peace. If you have any news, I ask that it not be burdensome to make me a participant in your letters; to whom and to your wife and all your children I commend myself from the heart and inform you that today I have become the godfather of your Werner Bullinger's son, to whom a beautiful child was born and was named Jakob in baptism.</p>
      <p>Bremgarten, 9th of September.</p>
      <p>Your Panizzone, acting on behalf of the emperor.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and my lord, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
