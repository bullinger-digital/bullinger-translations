    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The people of Zürich have read the letter addressed to them [No. 2747 from January 11] as well as the unacceptable confession of faith by the Zofingen pastors [Johannes Ulrich Göppel and Benedikt Schürmeister]. They understood that their Bernese colleagues are asking them to point out the dubious and incorrect parts of this confession of faith. They are happy to do so, even though they are overloaded with work. The request from Bern arrived yesterday at nightfall, so there was no opportunity for a consultation among the Zürich pastors. They gathered this morning at 7 o'clock. It was not easy at all to decipher the poorly written confession. Nevertheless, it was very important to them to be helpful to their Bernese colleagues.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The Zürich pastors believe that the Bernese should not allow everyone to write a confession of faith, nor should they agree to review such texts. This would create a huge additional workload, which they are not obliged to undertake. Furthermore, such confessions would only give rise to disputes, and anyone could resort to ambiguous statements. If a confession of faith were approved, there would also be the risk that its author would boast about it and a dispute would arise. The Bernese should make it clear to everyone that they do not wish for confessions of faith, as these allow for unclear, careless, or ambiguous statements.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] First, the Zürich pastors will address the topic of the pastoral office, then that of the Lord's Supper.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Scripture teaches that only God, through the Holy Spirit, grants and increases faith, and that only Christ brings about salvation. The church minister is only entitled to proclaim the word and to offer (offere) and administer (administrare) the signs (symbola); however, the signified (res) (to which the signs point) cannot be mediated by the church minister. Only the one whom God draws to himself comes to Christ (John 6, [65]). John the Baptist baptized only with water, but Christ with the Holy Spirit. Paul also speaks of himself merely as a herald (praeco) (2Tim 1, [11]) and emphasizes that the sower or the waterer is nothing compared to the one who enables growth (1Cor 3, [7-9]). Therefore, those prayers with which we ask that the proclaimed word be made fruitful by God's Spirit. It is thus always inappropriate to say that a pastor has converted or enlightened someone. God alone enlightens, forgives sins, or converts. This should be made clear to the disputing parties and they should be asked if they believe and teach accordingly. If they affirm this, they must be urged to actually do so, to avoid confusing and misleading statements, and to seek only the honor of Christ and not their own honor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Here are some points in this confession of faith that are displeasing or questionable regarding the pastor and his office.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] In A) it is claimed that the pastor is an instrument through which God imparts faith. The sacraments are referred to as tools (instrumenta) through which God grants his grace. Even better: Through pastors and sacraments, believers are to be perfected (perficere)! This is Thomistic and scholastic. The pastor and the sacraments convey nothing, they merely announce! God gives everything. He uses the service of the pastor, but is not dependent on it. Paul also makes this clear when he writes: "Are you so foolish that you now end with the flesh, where you began with the Spirit?"</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Why then in B) the claim that "God governs the visible church through his servants"? The authors of the confession should rather seek a position with the Pope! God governs his church through his word and his spirit. He is the king (rex), the shepherd (pastor), and the ruler (rector); we are servants who must not appropriate anything that belongs to our Lord. Although he grants us something, it is only if we completely surrender to him and he can govern through us. The authors of the confession pursue a secret goal, which is quite well expressed when they write: "The spiritual authority (gwalt) of a synod reaches to heaven." In this way, they gild the pastoral office so that some of this shine also benefits them, where the Lord has predicted that we will be nothing in this world, and Paul already said: "We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ! We are weak, but you are strong! We are despised, but you are honored!" (1Cor 4, [10]). And because of the esteem they enjoy, one should now believe them! The proclaimed word is supposedly adorned by their powers (virtutes)! Through their office, the church is even to be induced to believe in the word! Whom should one now believe: the word or the pastor?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] To justify their view, they distort in C) the original meaning of several Bible passages, including the exhortation "Bear fruit!" (John 15, [16]). But who produces these fruits? Is it not the one who enables growth? They should read the beginning of John 15 again! It says that God is the farmer and we are the branches; God tends the branches so that they bear fruit. We can only prune and harvest (John 4, [35-38] and Mt 9, [37f]). In Mt 10, [20], it also says: "It is not you who will speak, but the Spirit of your Father." Therefore, the honor belongs to the Spirit and not to the speaker. Incidentally, the confession of faith is so poorly written that the people of Zürich often could not decipher it. There, the authors refer to 1Cor 4, [1], where the pastor is described as a "steward of the mysteries of God." Of course, we are stewards! However, this does not support the authors' view. The Lord describes the duties of a steward in Mt 24, [45-51], and Lk 12, [35-48], and from the letter to the Ephesians, it is clear that the mystery of God is the gospel. Bucer, who tries too hard to restore the authority of the pastor, always refers to 2Cor 3, and his monkeys imitate this cat! Paul describes the preachers of the gospel as servants of the Spirit, but there he contrasts the Spirit with the letter. And what Paul means by letter is clearly shown in the subsequent discussions. Paul does not claim that we give (dare) or administer (administrare) the Spirit, for this is reserved for God alone. That Paul in 1Thess 2, [4. 8f], refers to the gospel he proclaimed as God's word, is irrelevant. This rather glorifies God's word and not God's servant. The same apostle speaks of the gospel (which reports about Christ) as "the power (potentia) of God for the salvation of all believers." What honor does this now bestow on the servant of God? "Faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of God." Furthermore, those who proclaim God's word are only messengers (missi). Consequently, the honor belongs to the sender and the word. A careful study of Gal 3 shows that those who attribute a perfecting power (perfectio) to external things are completely mistaken.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] The statements in D) and E) about the [Bernese] Disputation [of 1528] and the quoted passages from it do not need to be commented on by the Zürich pastors, as their Bernese colleagues are very familiar with them. Likewise, the Zürich pastors will not comment on the quote taken from the [“Cancell and Agend booklet” of 1541] (ex rituali libello). The Bernese colleagues will be able to clearly show that these passages were misused.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Just as in the matter of the pastoral office, the Bernese should proceed in the matter of the Lord's Supper. They should not allow confessions to be imposed on them for review on this topic, but simply refer to the words of the Lord and those of the "Disputatio." The 4th article of this "Disputatio" is clear. It should be presented to the authors of this confession of faith, and they should be required to clearly state what they believe and teach, and not be allowed to use slippery or incomprehensible words that cause embarrassment. In a controversy, clear words in their original meaning should be used, and ambiguous words should be avoided. The following topics should be addressed: The truth of Christ's body; the presence of Christ's body; what it means to eat (manducare) Christ's body; finally, the purpose (finis) of the Lord's Supper.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Christ assumed a true (vera) and consubstantial (consubstantialis) body (caro) with which he lived, died, and rose again. In his glorification (clarificatio), this body retained its nature and properties, even though its weaknesses (infirmitates) were removed (auferre). This can be supported by many passages, especially by the statements about the body we will assume after the resurrection. Therefore, a true human body was raised to heaven! And with this, Christ will also return and judge. So if asked whether this glorified body is present in the Lord's Supper, the answer is: No. If someone counters that Christ is present, but not "corporally, quantitatively, locally, qualitatively," they should be forbidden from using such monstrous words, as they only serve to blind the ordinary person (simplex). Wouldn't one boo someone who claims that somewhere a fire or a light is burning, but it neither warms nor shines? Yet it is just as absurd to claim that the body (corpus) is truly present and then make statements that call this into question. Why can't one do without the word "truly" and simply say that Christ, and not his body (caro), is present through his divinity, majesty, and power, his operation (operatio), his strength (virtus), and his life (vita)? Why not simply explain that "eating Christ's body" is nothing other than believing in him? Let the opponents babble on until they go mad! The truth is clearly laid out in John 6: Eating means nothing other than believing! The one who believes, therefore, eats. Care must be taken not to confuse spiritual eating (manducatio spiritualis) with sacramental eating (manducatio sacramentalis), to prevent the opponent from drawing false conclusions. The "manducatio spiritualis" concerns only faith; in the "manducatio sacramentalis," the external signs are also involved. Finally, the Lord clearly reveals the purpose of the Lord's Supper: remembrance, thanksgiving, the external clarification of the covenant (see Lk 22, [19f]; 1Cor 10, [16f]; 11, [23-26]). That sins would also be forgiven in this process is an invention of the opponents! The forgiveness of sins depends on Christ's blood and faith. If the disciples had obtained the forgiveness of their sins during the Lord's Supper, why then did Jesus have to shed his blood the next day?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Note how contradictory the authors of the confession express themselves in A)! The body (corpus) and blood of Christ are present in the Lord's Supper, but in a spiritual way (spiritualiter). However, by "spiritual," they do not mean that the body has been transformed into spirit. If this does not happen, the body (corpus) still exists! But it cannot be present. Why then continue to discuss the presence of the body? What evil spirit has led to disputes in the church about this, when the Lord clearly taught in John 14, 15, 16, and 17 that he will support his church not physically, but spiritually? Does true faith, which alone justifies, cleanses, and redeems, require an allegedly salvific return of the body (reditum corporis) and a bodily feeding (manducatio corporalis)?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] In B), C), and D), the authors of the confession again claim that Jesus is truly (vere) present, but not bodily (corporaliter). What then does the word "truly" mean, which they previously equated with "bodily"? Why continue to quarrel? Why continue to insult each other? The believer should seek peace. The opponents want to prevent the faith from appearing as purely fictitious (ficta fides) during the Lord's Supper! But who claims that one approaches the Lord's Supper with a fictitious faith? When the believer speaks of faith, he means true, living, and effective faith! And if the Lord is not bodily present, he is, however, present for the believers, and not only during the Lord's Supper. The authors' statements are really unserious! At one point, they speak of a sleeping person who eats in his sleep, and of a waking person who is hungry: Pure slander! Did the Lord not say that he is food (cibum)? Whoever believes in him is truly (sensibiliter) and not fictitiously (imaginarie) fed! All their other claims are of the same kind.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Why do the authors mention the Messalians or Euchites in L)? These attributed everything to their prayers and were therefore also called "prayers." They believed that the sacraments were superfluous; that it was enough to be filled with the Spirit. We know well that the Spirit liberates, yet believers still need the sacraments, and they could only do without them in exceptional cases. Thus, the [Ethiopian] eunuch and the [Roman centurion] Cornelius were baptized, and the apostles, who were the first to receive the Spirit, still participated in the Lord's Supper. "It is fitting to do everything that justice demands."</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] In N), the authors of the confession claim to have already reached the fortified harbor of salvation, from which they now want to fight error and sin. Oh, how confused these people are by their Philonic views! The people of Zürich certainly do not err because they hold the view of spiritual feeding (manducatio spiritualis), especially since this is based on John 6!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] The authors' chatter in O) about the offering (exhibitio) in the Lord's Supper and similar matters has already been refuted elsewhere by the people of Zürich. A church minister only offers (exhibere) the sign (symbolum), not the signified (res). God alone offers the latter, which can only be received through faith.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] This is the Zürich response to the Bernese request, written in haste. The Bernese actually did not need this response, as they already know enough about it. However, the people of Zürich did not want to refuse their request. The Bernese should show themselves strong and steadfast and expect their help from the Lord. The people of Zürich will pray for them. One of the Bernese should then report how the whole matter was resolved. This letter should also be returned, as there was no time to make a copy of it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">[18] Greetings.</p>

  <body>
    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Grace and peace through Christ Jesus, our only Lord and Savior. We have read your letters, most honorable and beloved brothers in the Lord, and we have also read the compiled and poorly constructed confession of the ministers of the Zofingen church. We understand that you ask us to point out what seems to us to be either insincerely or carelessly stated. This is something you can easily obtain from us, even though each of us is entangled in difficult affairs. We hurried as much as we could. For on the evening of the 16th, the messenger delivered the letters, and the approaching night did not allow for a meeting. However, the next day, that is today, January 17th, at seven in the morning, we five gathered and discussed, albeit not without nausea. Not because it was troublesome to serve you, but because it was most troublesome to read and reread poorly composed laws. Be assured of this from us, that just as we are entirely yours, we will deny you nothing that is ours.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Above all, we advise you not to allow anyone the freedom to draft confessions of faith, nor should you be so accommodating as to examine or scrutinize anyone's confession. For just as you owe this to no one by any right, so it would be a task of immense effort and no benefit; indeed, it would be a rich source of dissension. Not to mention that it is easy to find ambiguous words that can be received with pious intent, yet also interpreted otherwise and used to confirm a wrong opinion. As long as matters are dealt with through written confessions, there will be no end to contention. Therefore, we would abolish confessions for parties and seek the truth through questions. It is a matter that can be clearly and understandably resolved in a few words. If you approve those confessions, each will have something to boast about and renew the fight. Therefore, you can most justly say to them; because some confessions are obscure, some are incautious, some are insincere, we do not want them to be our canons. Scripture will be the canon. A disputation sought from the scriptures will be the declaration.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>First, we will deal with the ministry, then with the supper.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Concerning the ministry and ministers, scripture pronounces thus: Only God, through the Spirit, gives faith, increases, and confirms faith, briefly, all saving power is of Christ; the minister only announces the external word, offers or administers the symbol, not the thing signified. Testimonies: John 6. [22-65, especially 44]: "No one comes to me unless my Father draws him." John the Baptist says: "I am the voice crying in the wilderness, I baptize with water, he will baptize with the Holy Spirit" [John 1, 23; Luke 3, 16]. Therefore, Paul calls himself a herald 2 Timothy 1 [11], and 1 Corinthians 3 [7]: "He who waters or plants is nothing, but God who gives the increase." Here belong the prayers by which we ask that the seed of God's word sown in hearts may grow and bear fruit through the Holy Spirit. Therefore, wherever ministers are said to convert or enlighten, or similar, it is clear that these are improper expressions. For scripture cannot contradict itself. For God alone enlightens, God alone forgives sin, God alone converts. These things we would propose absolutely and simply to the parties; we would ask if they believe and teach thus. If they say yes, you will urge them to teach sincerely, to avoid the wrappings of words and traps of expressions, to explain themselves most clearly, so that nothing is attributed to us ministers, all glory to Christ and the word.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Now we will briefly touch on what displeases and seems insidiously placed in their confession concerning the ministry and ministers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>A. Ministers are said to be instruments through which God confers faith. Sacraments are said to be instruments through which grace is infused. Indeed, through ministers and sacraments, believers are perfected. This you know to be Thomistic and scholastic. Ministers and sacraments confer nothing, but announce. God confers all. God uses our ministry, but is not bound to it. What is it to attribute perfection to our ministry but to contradict Paul who says: "Are you so foolish that having begun in the Spirit, you are now made perfect by the flesh?" [Galatians 3, 3], unless our ministry is not carnal and external.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>B. What need is there for humble ministers with that expression: God governs the church visibly through ministers? It would be more fitting for the Pope's vicarage. God governs his church, and he governs by word and spirit. He himself is king, shepherd, and ruler; we are servants, usurping nothing of dominion for ourselves. Yet something is granted to us if he governs in us, that is, if we are those through whom he governs. This glory is due to the spirit and the word. The people are more concerned with what is said outwardly, perhaps someone said it outwardly, who wrote, that the spiritual power of synods reaches up to heaven. They want to gild the ministry so that the ministers also shine and are not so dark and contemptible in the world, although the Lord said we would be obscure in the world. We could object to those seeking splendor with that of Paul: "We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ; we are weak, but you are strong; we are despised, but you are honored" 1 Corinthians 4 [10] etc. But that clarity is for the end to be made for ministers. Let the word be adorned with its virtues; that will finally lead the church to believe the word. Should we believe us or the word?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>C. As for the testimonies with which they wish to approve their opinion, most seem distorted from their native sense. John 15 [5 and 16]: "Bear fruit." But who prepared the fruit? Is it not he who gave the increase? [1 Corinthians 3, 6]. Let the beginning of the 15th chapter be consulted, where it is said that the branches are ministers. "The Father is the farmer; he prunes the branches so that they bear fruit" [John 15, 1f]. Behold, the Father is he through whom the fruit is prepared, ministers only cut or harvest and bring. John 4 [37f] and Matthew 9. chapter [37f]. Matthew 10 [20]: "It is not you who speak, but the spirit of your Father." Therefore, glory is due to the spirit, not to the speakers. Indeed, the spirit speaks. The one who wrote this obscure confession wrote very poorly, so much so that we often hesitated and could not read. But according to their opinion, he wrote very well 1 Corinthians 4 [1]: "Distributors of the mysteries of God." Rightly indeed distributors! But we say this in jest in a serious matter. But what does this have to do with Mercury? The Lord describes dispensers in Matthew 24 [45-51], Luke 12 [35-48]. The mystery is the gospel as is clear from the letter to the Ephesians [1, 3-23]. Bucer, who seems to be excessive in restoring the authority, as he calls it, of ministers, constantly urges the place of Paul 2 Corinthians 3 [4-11]. These imitate him like monkeys a cat. Paul calls the ministers of the spirit preachers of the gospel [probably 1 Timothy 2, 7; 2 Timothy 1, 11]. For he opposes the spirit to the letter. What he means by the letter is clear from Paul's subsequent words. But Paul does not say that we give or administer the spirit, which is God's alone. The same apostle in 1 Thessalonians 2 [9] called the gospel preached by him the word of God, and indeed the word of God, nothing to Bacchus. This transfers all respect and glory from ministers to the word. The same apostle calls the gospel the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes [Romans 1, 16]. For the gospel is the preaching of Christ, the arm of God, by which whoever believes is saved. What does this grant to ministers? Romans 10 [17]: "Faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of God," and those sent preach [Romans 10, 15]. Therefore, all glory returns to the sender and the word. Let the place of Paul Galatians 3. chapter [1-14] be carefully examined and it will act for us against those who attribute perfection to external things.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>D. E. We say nothing about the disputation and the words cited from the disputation. For we know that you are so exercised in it that you have no need of our admonition. Thus we say nothing about the words taken from the ritual booklet. Briefly, they seem to abuse the testimonies taken from both. But your prudence knows what is needed here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Just as we have judged to act in the matter of the ministry, so we think you should act in the matter of the supper; not that they prescribe to you and force you to approve or refute or judge, but that what the Lord has spoken and what has been declared in the disputation should be the prescription. The articles or proposition 4 is clear enough. Let it be proposed to them, let it be required of them what they believe and teach. Let them cease to speak perplexedly, to use slippery and inconsistent words. In controversies, words must be used in their proper meaning. Words about which there is controversy, and which can be taken in a contrary sense, must be omitted. Let it be dealt with these heads: First about the truth of the body of Christ, then about the presence of the body of Christ, hence about the eating of the body of Christ, finally about the end of the Lord's supper.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Christ assumed a true and consubstantial flesh with us, in which he suffered and was buried. In it, he rose again. Glorification did not absorb the nature and property, but removed the infirmity. The truth of the body remained. This can be proved by many arguments, especially by the resurrection of our bodies. Therefore, true flesh and truly human body was taken up into heaven. In heaven, it retains the truth. For he is to come to judge, etc. Now if asked whether that body, which is true, is in the supper, orthodox and catholic faith simply commands to deny this. If they add: truly present, but not corporally, quantitatively, locally, qualitatively, we command them to abstain from the monsters of words, and to cease to blind the simple. They use verbal tricks. Wouldn't it be rejected by all of us, who would say that fire or light truly burns somewhere, but does not shine and warm? And they say the body is truly present and soon add things that take away the truth. Why then do they not expunge the word "truly." Let them say simply and sincerely how Christ, not the flesh of Christ, can be present, by divinity, majesty, power, operation, virtue, life, etc. Moreover, to eat the body of Christ is nothing else than to believe. Now if the adversaries babble on to hoarseness, the truth says in John 6 [47f, 63], eating is nothing else than believing. Therefore, he who believes eats. And here care must be taken not to mix spiritual eating and sacramental eating, but to speak distinctly, nor should they be allowed the faculty of drawing false conclusions. Spiritual eating is of faith, sacramental is external with the sign added. Furthermore, the end of the supper is shown by the Lord in several ways: It is done in memory, it is done for thanksgiving, that we may give thanks, it is done for external confederation (Luke 22 [19f]; 1 Corinthians 10 [16] and 11 [24f]). What they attach as another end, for the remission of sins, they invent themselves. The remission of sins is of the blood of Christ and faith. If the disciples ate in the supper for the remission of sins, what need was there to shed blood the next day? They understood therefore that the blood was to be shed for the remission of the faithful and for the memory to be celebrated. They did not understand that remission was from the supper taken.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>A. Consider briefly how poorly they coherently express themselves, these men: The body and blood of Christ are present in the supper, but spiritually. But they explain spiritually, not that the body is converted into spirit. Well. If therefore it is not converted into spirit, the body remains. Therefore, it is not present. What need is there to dispute about the presence of the body? Or what evil demon commanded and taught us to dispute about the presence of the true body in the church, when the Lord himself taught so diligently in John 14 [15-26], 15 [26f], 16 [13], 17 [11-26] that he would be present to the church not bodily, but spiritually? Does true faith, which alone justifies, purifies, saves, require the return of the body and bodily eating for salvation?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>B. C. D. Soon they say: "Truly present, but not bodily." What then is "truly?" Have they not hitherto used truly for "bodily?" Absolutely. Why then do we draw the cord of contention? Why do we weave crime with crimes by contentious words injected? It is for the faithful to speak peacefully and seek peace. But they want to prevent anyone from thinking that one should approach the supper with fictitious faith. Indeed: Who teaches that one should approach with fictitious faith? When the faithful hear faith, they understand true, living, effective faith. And if the Lord is truly present not bodily, he is present truly to his believers, even when they do not celebrate the supper. For faith is effective. Their expositions are so cold that we are ashamed to dwell on them longer. It is mere slander when they bring up I know not what about dreaming and eating in dreams, but being hungry when awake. The Lord says he is food [John 6, 48]. Therefore, he who believes is truly fed sensibly, not imaginatively; truly as faith is wont to perceive. All other things are of such a kind that they do not need our examination.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>L. Why indeed are the Messalians, Euchites brought here? These attributed everything to their prayers, hence they were called prayers. They thought the sacraments were superfluous, that it was enough to be imbued with the spirit! We know we are absolved by the spirit of God, but nevertheless, sacraments are required by the faithful not excluding the utmost necessity. Thus the Eunuch was baptized [Acts 8, 38] and Cornelius [Acts 10, 47f]. The apostles celebrated the supper, who had received the firstfruits of the spirit. For we must fulfill all righteousness.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>N. Here they finally take refuge in the port from which they defend themselves, and by whose protection and defense they repel all suspicion of error or sin from themselves. We have not erred, because all our things rely on spiritual eating. It is founded on John 6 [63] and in the disputation. We see therefore how these men are troubled by Philonic views.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>O. What they chatter about the exhibition and similar things have been refuted elsewhere by us. Simply, the minister exhibits the symbol, does not exhibit the thing. Things are exhibited by God alone, they are received or perceived spiritually by faith.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>These things we wished to respond to your matters in the greatest haste, thus performing our duty to you. We know, however, that you are so instructed that you do not need these of ours. Yet we have written these because you wished it so. Be perpetually strong and constant in the Lord. Seek his counsel and help with unceasing prayers. He will not fail you and your church which he redeemed with his blood. We will also pray for your safety. We pray that one of you will diligently write how the controversial matter was resolved or composed, and that you will return this letter or the response to this letter. For due to the shortness of time, it was scarcely possible to write thus.</p>
