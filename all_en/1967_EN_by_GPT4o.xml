      <p>Greetings. I do not think you are unaware, most pious and renowned men, celebrated for your universal learning, how poorly those who teach correctly with you about the sacraments of the Church of Christ are spoken of, not only among the impious and utterly deplorable papists, but also among the reformed Saxon churches and many northern churches dependent on them. In these places, the envy and hatred of your name have grown so strong due to the excessive authority of one man, whom they believe has never erred, that even mentioning you is considered dangerous. And although these same people now foster many sects among themselves, which continue to grow (because of their arrogance, as the Lord permits), they all agree and are united in this: to malign you and those who rightly understand the mysteries with you, calling you by disgraceful names as if you were the most harmful enemies of Christ, and they do so publicly in sermons to the people, always associating you with the most pestilent and seditious Anabaptists, to make you also suspected of sedition and more hated, just as the Jews did to Christ by hanging him between thieves. This infamy of your name has deterred many from the knowledge of the truth, as people, persuaded to think ill of you, block their ears like serpents at the first word of sound doctrine, lest they hear the truth, which they consider to be a Satanic imposture. However, although I do not doubt that, due to your long-suffering and Christian patience, you take in good part whatever insults are thrown at you, innocent for Christ's sake, the cause of the scandal that arises from it should not be perpetually neglected. For there are not a few in these northern churches who indeed understand the mysteries correctly but do not dare to profess it because of those who have long claimed the kingdom of doctrine for themselves there. Therefore, if you wish to consult for these and many others, as I certainly do not doubt you wish, it would seem advisable to me, in my ignorance, that you should write two books about the sacraments of Christ, namely baptism and the Lord's Supper, which the Lord himself instituted, with as much diligence as possible, dividing the work among yourselves with Latin and German annotations, as it might seem to you to be useful for both the learned and the unlearned, because of certain unrefined pastors of the churches and moderately learned laypeople, especially nobles, to whom the purer and more noble German language, which is used in the courts of princes, is more familiar, even in Denmark and Sweden: then it might be possible, with the Lord's cooperation, to make the more timid pastors bolder and the powerful and noble, having acquired some taste of the truth.</p>
      <p>After sufficient and solid confirmation of true doctrines and sober and modest refutation of false ones (for I would not have you repay insults with insults), all will easily understand from these two books that you have nothing in common with the seditious Anabaptists (against whom you were the first to stand, while others connived) and will see how unjustly your adversaries have always associated you with them, prevailing more by slanders than by arguments or scriptures, and then the pious will have something to oppose to the tricks of the adversaries.</p>
      <p>But so that those who prescribe doctrines to the churches may cease to invent new sacraments, as they now do from among us (I call ours those among whom I now dwell as a foreigner), who insert the keys as a third sacrament between baptism and the Lord's Supper, so that they may have more authority (perhaps because of the holy and abundant confessional penny), although they cannot show any element that becomes a sacrament with the word of God added, unless perhaps they have enclosed the breath of Christ, with pardon for the word, like Aeolus enclosing the winds in a bag, etc., it will be necessary to correct this error in the division of the sacraments or elsewhere, as it seems to you. In the former book on baptism, not only the principal errors of the Anabaptists must be refuted, but also the ravings of our own, who now reign in the purer churches and who, having sworn to the words of their master (from whom they think it a sin to dissent even in anything), teach that infants understand the words of the baptizer and believe them and thus have their own faith in which they are baptized, etc. By this too impudent begging of the question, occasion was once given to the Anabaptists, who were previously unknown in our age, first to reject paedobaptism, then to also attack it.</p>
      <p>These things seem to be noted so that it may be clear to all that the most harmful sect of the Anabaptists does not derive its origin from you, as some babble, but from those who, being too pleased with themselves, rashly blurt out whatever comes to their mouth and imprudently and impudently reproach others with their own vices.</p>
      <p>Those must also be refuted who teach more superstitiously than religiously that the faithful should hastily bring newborn infants to baptism or have them baptized by women (to whom the Lord has entrusted no ecclesiastical function) when they are dying, as if the infants of faithful Christians have no salvation in the Lord, who are taken from here by untimely death by the will of God before they are baptized by man. Because of this error, pious parents have often been too bitterly tormented, considering their offspring eternally damned, although the children of the Hebrews, who died uncircumcised before the eighth day, are not excluded from the covenant of God, nor are girls, or as if salvation were conferred by us or the elements, since the Lord promised Abraham, the father of the faithful, that he would be the God of the faithful and their seed after them. The same should be done in the latter book on the Lord's Supper, where no less is sinned on the right and on the left, which I think you know better than to need anyone's admonition, how they teach the forgiveness of sins to be brought there and many other equally foolish things. It would also be pleasing, if it seemed good to you, that after the two books are written, as it pleases you, a dialogue should be added as a kind of epilogue, in which the most absurd things of the antagonists (with names omitted) would be produced and refuted. This form of teaching is very effective among the unlearned, of which I send you a rough example of a fragment of annotations, which I once patched together for my brother from your books, returning to you what is yours, not teaching, whose shoes I am not worthy to untie.</p>
      <p>However, lest the most distinguished and reverend Mr. Johannes Calvin, your singular friend, be angry with me, as if I wanted to be ingenious in another's book, if he should perhaps learn that I have used his name and catechism in this fragment with many transpositions or even changes, as it seemed to me to be useful for my brother, I ask you to intercede for me in this fault, and I do not doubt that, being rightly admonished, as a good man, he will forgive everything.</p>
      <p>When your work is completed, its dedication would now seem to fit no princes more, if it pleases you, than the most serene King Christian of the Danes, etc., and his most illustrious son-in-law, Duke Augustus of Saxony, the elector, etc. (if they are willing to be what they are called), and I would wish this to be done in the name of the Church of Zurich with humble and devoted promise or profession, if the most serene majesty of the king or the most illustrious grace of the prince elector should desire anything in this work, that you would humbly declare it either in writing or, if they prefer, in words in person, if you are called, and prove that your doctrine is not Satanic, but from the word of God.</p>
      <p>With this implicit and concealed and modest call for the antagonists to dispute (for the princes would not hear you without them), I would hope that either your confidence would confirm the princes themselves beyond many others, or they would call a synod or assembly with safe conduct, or the slanderers would be forced to be silent, or at least gradually become milder, who would not willingly engage with you in the arena of disputation, which they have always avoided, even if they blather otherwise to the people, and the people would have something to object to them, namely, if they were so certain of their doctrines, why do they not refute you in a public disputation, to which you would voluntarily offer yourselves ready, and your otherwise very ancient church would be vindicated from the disgrace with which it has long been defamed, indeed almost defiled.</p>
      <p>Care must be taken not to invent new titles for the princes, content with the customary usage, lest the slanderers, as in the past, have something to criticize and make your writings hated before they are read; for each one must be given his due honor, and words must be used like currency, which I wanted to remind you, most distinguished men, prompted by no other zeal than piety. Although it may seem to be the arrogance of an impudent person, that an unknown and unlearned and utterly barbarous man, indeed a sordid merchant, does not fear to write his nonsense to you as if a muddy pig were to teach Minerva, yet your remarkable piety, which is known to me from your writings, made me bold, as I consider how great and fervent is your zeal for reforming and promoting true Christian religion, so that you are not reluctant to move any stone, by whatever means you can, to extend the boundaries of the kingdom of Christ and persuade as many as possible of the true doctrine of salvation, even against their will. Therefore, relying on this confidence, I fear nothing, who will bear with equanimity the foolishness of an unknown and cowardly client for a little while, while I do what I do (although the vilest member of the church, yet not rejected, as I hope), in the zeal for promoting piety, acting as a whetstone in the meantime, since I cannot be the sword itself rightly dividing the word of God, and I ask that you make no mention of me in your public writings; for I do not seek such a thing, and it would indeed be very dangerous for me, who am often forced to travel through Holland, Brabant, and Flanders and other inhospitable places for the pious, although there are not a few pious and learned men there, but hidden.</p>
      <p>It will suffice for me to be received by you as a little client, if I am worthy, even among the last, unknown, who was once known to your Leo of blessed memory, although not by face.</p>
      <p>I also beseech you, reverend patrons in the Lord, to favor your little client with your prayers, without any delay or tedium; the Lord will supply strength and industry with his spirit and the reward of labor with an unfading crown, and in the meantime, the liberality of the princes towards you will undoubtedly not be ungrateful. To testify my love for you, I give you, according to my means, a Delphic cloth, in which no expense has been spared and woven with better and selected English wool and so prepared that it needs no further preparation, except to be cut and sewn into tunics by a tailor, which I ask you to receive with the spirit in which it is given, not forgetting that even two small coins given to the treasury were pleasing to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your labor will also be pleasing, as I hope, to many pious people, even to the professors of the University of Copenhagen, who have not all sworn to the words of a master, as well as to many in the court of the king and the elector. Our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom you are valiant soldiers, may perfect his work in you by his spirit to his glory, to pacify and enlighten his churches. Amen.</p>
      <p>From Hamburg, the day after Bartholomew's Day, in the year etc. 53, and commend me to the brothers of your church before the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your devoted client of your church, Baptist Johannes Wisamer, has signed.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and excellent men, pious and faithful pastors and doctors of the Church of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Theodor Bibliander, and Rudolf Gwalther, his most esteemed lords and patrons.</p>
