    <p xml:id="regest1">The mayor, [Thomas Blarer], who has fallen ill again, returns his greetings. If [Konrad] Klauser had received permission to come [as a tutor to Konrad Zwick], they would have been concerned about the continuation of his studies; they ask again for help in filling the position. Bullinger should assist the letter bearer in the search for [works by] Albertus [Magnus?].</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Our mayor has been struck again by the quartan fever, dearest Bullinger; but we do not expect it to last. Nevertheless, I commend him to your prayers. He has instructed me to thank you for your concern for his health and to send you his warmest regards.</p>
      <p>Regarding the young Klauser, the situation is as I have testified in other letters; however, if we had received the favor of your support, we would have made every effort to ensure that he would have been with us not to the neglect, but to the advancement of his studies. Now, however, since this hope has slipped away from us, we do not cease to ask you again and again, that if anyone else of such caliber could be obtained through your advice and assistance, you should not neglect it, my brother. The danger that this delay brings with it torments us miserably; for we wish to provide for our boys in a timely manner.</p>
      <p>But now I have nothing else, as this messenger, who has been sent to us, is also in a hurry, as you can see from the letters here. Moreover, since I have not found that Albert anywhere among us, I would like you to do a favor for the sake of that good man, if he might be found among you, although I also doubt whether he desires philosophical or indeed theological works.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my brother, and pray to the Lord for me.</p>
      <p>December 15, 1537.</p>
      <p>I return the booklet here with thanks.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
