      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Do not be surprised that I have not written about your relative's affairs. He had recently assured me that he would be a living letter to you and would discuss his matters with you abundantly. Now, however, hearing from the boy that you are asking me to write about his business, I want you to know that it has been dealt with by the Margrave's people, and a condition has been offered that is indeed quite difficult and laborious for his current age, although the salary is not to be despised. After some days of deliberation, he came to me to share his plans.</p>
      <p>Moreover, anxious and hesitant about what he should do, he finally declined the offered condition, giving thanks to Habsperg, and excusing himself due to his weaker age, which is not suitable for bearing this burden. But if I may confess the truth through your kindness, the good man is still weak not so much in strength as in faith, fearing the persuasion of the papists and indeed of his wife to change both his place and his accustomed religion, in which he believes he can be beyond the reach of all weapons. Therefore, I can no longer serve either him or you unless some hope arises that he can be received in our city. If I can achieve anything in this matter, I will not fail him; for it seemed to me that it would be easier for him to be transferred here than to the Margraviate. This is what I had to write about this business, now so overwhelmed with affairs that I cannot write more. Today, Pharellus and Beza arrived to us, announcing the cruel persecution of Christians throughout France, even in such a great danger to the kingdom. Let us therefore pray more fervently for His church.</p>
      <p>Farewell well, September 28, hastily, Basel 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Jung.</p>
      <p>For the Apocalypse, I thank you, wishing from the heart to reciprocate your kindness, etc.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and most learned man of all kinds, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my venerable lord and dearest brother.</p>
