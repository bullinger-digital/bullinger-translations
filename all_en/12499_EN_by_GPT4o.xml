    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's letter [not received] was most welcome to Myconius, especially since the news conveyed in it about [Duke Heinrich of] Brunswick [and his son Karl Viktor], about the Turks, and about the Diet [in Baden] answered many of his questions. The news about the Burgundian [Jean Mouchet de Poligny] and the letter from Emperor [Charles V to Zurich] also interested him greatly. The Basel supporters of the Emperor believe [the friendly content of this letter], but Myconius does not, especially since he learned that the Emperor allowed the fratricide [Alfonso] Diaz to escape to Rome.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Everything has become quiet around Count Wilhelm [of Fürstenberg]. What was learned about him in Basel was also told in Strasbourg, where even more was reported about him. The Basel [city] clerk [Heinrich Ryhiner] was there, after all. Merchants traveling through Basel from Burgundy said they do not know if the Count himself recruited soldiers in Burgundy; however, a nobleman [...] is said to have tried to recruit about 500 lightly armed horsemen for Piedmont in the name of the Emperor. Nobles in Basel further report that Count Wilhelm instructed one of his troop leaders [...] to recruit about 500 foot soldiers. However, since he did not want to disclose the purpose for which they were to serve, the troop leader did not comply with the order. The melancholic Count is currently not in Strasbourg but in Montfort [correct: Ortenberg]. Meanwhile, the Bernese are well informed about him and will reprimand him. Perhaps his end is even near. It's a pity, even though he never liked the Confederates; he is said to be the most faithful zealot for the Gospel among the German princes.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- From a letter of an Italian [...] to Peter Martyr [Vermigli], it is learned that the participants in the Council of Trent are bound and must adhere to the weekly orders of Pope [Paul III]. The Bishops of Bitonto and Fiesole, Cornelio [Musso] [and Braccio Martelli], were threatened because they were not willing to call the Synod of Trent universal. Furthermore, not every prelate is allowed to participate in the sessions. This was, for example, forbidden to the Bishop of Istria, [Pier] Paolo Vergerio, even though he had declared himself ready to fully submit to the Council, and his services had previously been used in Germany! The whole city [of Trent] took offense at this, especially since it was even ordered to confiscate his Lutheran books at his home in Istria, as if bishops were not allowed to own German books, even though they are required to condemn them. So much for the news of this letter. They please Myconius insofar as the Protestants are thereby prevented from seeking an agreement with the Papists.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings also to [Rudolf] Gwalther, to whom Bullinger should convey the information about the Council.</p>

      <p>S. I cannot express in words how welcome the news you conveyed in your last letter was, for there were certain matters about which I had been in doubt for some time, and no one had dispelled my doubts, such as about the people of Brunswick, the Turkish endeavors, the Diet of our people, etc. I was particularly pleased to learn about the Burgundian [Jean Mouchet de Poligny] and the Emperor's letter! The supporters of the Emperor here believe he wrote without hypocrisy. However, I do not believe him at all, especially after hearing that the fratricide Diaz was allowed to escape to Rome by him.</p>

      <p>Everything has become quiet around Count Wilhelm [of Fürstenberg]. Meanwhile, whatever was said here was also said in Strasbourg, and much more besides. Our city clerk was in Strasbourg. He recounted all the rumors he heard; and indeed, they were just rumors! Shortly after, merchants from Burgundy arrived here, who, when asked about Wilhelm's passage through their territory, responded that they had heard some rumors, but they disregarded them. It is certain that a nobleman is among them, who openly attempts to gather up to five hundred lightly armed horsemen in the name of the Emperor, to be led into the Piedmont region. It is also known from the nobles we have here that the Count called one of his leaders to him and asked him to gather as many foot soldiers in his name, but when asked for what purpose, the Count remained silent (for he is so secretive about his plans that he has no equal in Germany). The leader then replied that he would comply, provided he was told against which enemy; otherwise, he would stay at home. And so they parted ways. He is not in Strasbourg, but in the fortress of Montfort (I believe it is called so). There he admits his melancholy into his counsel. Meanwhile, the Bernese are aware of everything, and they take it as if a bath (to say it in German) is prepared for him upon his arrival, in which he is to sweat. And who knows, perhaps even perish there? I feel sorry for the man, for he has the testimony of not being among the German princes who so faithfully support the Gospel; but his affection against our people surpasses this in him. But enough about him.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, there is no news except about the Council of Trent, about which an Italian writes to the Italian Peter Martyr in these words: "The prelates of the Council of Trent are bound by chains and harsh servitude, so that they dare not speak anything of themselves, but only pronounce judgment according to the prescription. Whoever among them attempted to propose what they thought was deterred by threats; among them, we know Cornelius, the Minorite and Bishop of Bitonto, and the Bishop of Fiesole, because they were unwilling to call the Synod of Trent by the name of the universal church. Not every prelate is admitted to the body or assembly of the synod at Trent; for if anyone comes whom they suspect will speak the truth, they exclude him, and in these days they did not want to admit Paul Vergerius, the Bishop of Istria, because he is learned and has experience and expertise in German affairs. If our people are not admitted to the council, what do you think will happen to the Germans if they approach? Nevertheless, this action of the council offends the entire city. This Bishop Vergerius, when he wanted to fully submit to the Council of Trent, is excluded by the pontificals, although his services have been used elsewhere among the Germans. They also sent to Istria to search for his Lutheran books so that under the pretext of this slander they might harass him at will, as if bishops were not allowed to have German books, which they are compelled to condemn. In short, nothing is decreed by those prelates except what has been prescribed to them weekly by the Pope." So much for that. The rest, if you do not have it, will follow later. These things please me exceedingly, for for these reasons we will cease to seek concord with the Papists. But in the meantime, they will undoubtedly stir up grave evils. These should be a spur to us for repentance and amendment of life.</p>

      <p>Farewell in the Lord with your family. You will communicate with Gwalther about the council. Basel, June 2, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, O. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, D. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the Lord, his venerable brother in Christ. Zurich.</p>
