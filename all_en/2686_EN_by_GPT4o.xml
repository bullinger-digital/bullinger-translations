      <p>S. D. I did not respond recently through Matthäus Peyer because, before I could know what was decided about him, I had to leave the city. Upon returning three days ago, I found this young man from your area, who had come with Matthäus, still here, through whom I send these few words to you. Firstly, as far as the swearing by the saints is concerned, I can still not perceive anything other than that my lords will not engage in any ungodly form of swearing. We know well in whom we believe; by him, we swear; for believing and swearing belong together. I also do not hope that the defiance will be allowed, that anyone in our church will be permitted to hang the saints. Sultzer writes from Basel that they have a special case; it is going badly for them. But this will bring us all to tears. The decision is not yet abandoned and nothing is concluded; but I hope through God's grace for nothing but good.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor that Zürich does not want to swear by the saints, but by others to take the oath. I do not believe that, for one is as good as the other, to give and to take. Dear friend, inform me about this; for none of your letters express this.</p>
      <p>In Geneva, everything is still in turmoil. Those who are exiled from there would like to return through our people. There are various opinions about this. Calvin is spoken of very badly. We defend him as much as we can. But such a bad rumor has prevailed about him that it cannot be removed by us. They say he is involved in the tortures and interrogations of the conspirators, and indeed nothing is done in this whole matter without his authority.</p>
      <p>As I can hardly believe this, there are those who affirm it to be true with certainty.</p>
      <p>Viret has gone to Geneva and preached there, gaining a very bad reputation among our people. Farel also went there and, with his impetuosity, almost overturned everything, if the public rumor is true. I see that the state of the Geneva republic can hardly stand in this way unless the Lord miraculously helps. Calvin certainly is also spoken of badly among those who have always been his supporters. I write to him less now because of the unjust suspicions with which we are all burdened, and because I see that they use our letters with little fidelity and caution.</p>
      <p>From Basel, I also fear that something monstrous may emerge. You know what Bellius wrote, or he who hides under this name, and what Beza replied. The question is now being debated among the ministers: should heretics be killed?</p>
      <p>There are various opinions to which Beza has responded. However, they criticize excessive harshness. And so we never lack contentions, but always one is woven from another. Our only consolation is that through the singular grace of the Lord, we are given to think the same in these controversies. May this truly be stable and perpetual. And for this, you too will pray to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Mr. Quaestor Haller returned yesterday, feeling somewhat better than before; he greets you. We have nothing from France.</p>
      <p>England is raging, as you know, Antichrist. I return the Polish confession; we saw it a few days ago, nevertheless, we give you great thanks. As for Matthäus Bavarus, he has no doubt reported to you himself what he has achieved. Our people are displeased that you seem to send some here from time to time, while we ourselves have a large number of people waiting; certainly, this causes me considerable inconvenience, which I would gladly be without. Farewell. All of ours greet you. Bern, August 6, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your H[aller].</p>
      <p>Besides the Polish confession, I have received nothing from you. You write that you are sending something published by Mr. Achilles Gasser; but whatever it is, it was neither in Musculus's nor in my letters, nor does Matthäus Bavarus, through whom you write you are sending it, admit to having or receiving such a thing; see therefore if you might have retained it with you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his honorable lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
