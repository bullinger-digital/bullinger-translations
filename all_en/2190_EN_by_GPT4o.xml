      <p>Greetings. At the same hour that I recently received your letters, I responded and sent the booklet at the same time, which I believe you have received, and in the meantime, I have not been able to obtain the other three; but perhaps they can be acquired from the Frankfurt market. I presented your letters along with the booklets to the honorable councilors, each of whom responded very kindly that your relative is known to them and that he has so far abundantly approved himself to all good people, and therefore, as far as they are concerned, they wish the best for your affairs and will assist with their own efforts. However, the reason they cannot promise anything certain here is that the position he seeks is perhaps not currently vacant, and even if it were to become vacant, the senate is overwhelmed by the multitude of applicants, both citizens and others, so that they scarcely know if anything can be achieved. They did not want to keep this from you, lest you be led by uncertain hope to miss better opportunities for your affairs.</p>
      <p>Moreover, they affirm that there is an abundance of scribes and those who seek public offices, because as the value of trade and crafts gradually decreases, citizens turn to other pursuits. However, I would not doubt that if he could manage to stay here at his own expense for a time, a way could be found to attend to his interests, and in my judgment, he would do well if he were to come to us at some point to seek counsel with the magnates.</p>
      <p>News of the English disturbances has also reached us, indicating that the city of London is conspiring in the same plan you write about, to not admit the Spanish king, and for this reason, they have called upon the French to provide assistance through the Scots. However, those who are undertaking these actions are not in insignificant danger, lest they be overwhelmed by the schemes of the opposing party and the forces of the queen and experience the worst. Therefore, they must be commended to the Lord with earnest prayers. I will ensure that the booklets sent to Strasbourg are delivered at the earliest opportunity. Farewell to you and all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, 17th of February, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
