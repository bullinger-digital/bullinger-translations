    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Before Bullinger had the opportunity to respond to Haller, he had already received three letters from him [HBBW XIX, No. 2821; No. 2837; No. 2844]. Should the reinstatement of the Catholic clergy occur in Augsburg, Haller should write to the Zurich council to request that they secure his safe return to Zurich from the Augsburg council, unless many believers urge him to stay to prevent the collapse of the congregation. According to the Acts of the Apostles, Paul founded churches (where he taught) even where there were synagogues and detestable pagan temples. Haller should always be guided by God's word, the example of the prophets and apostles, and the advice of the excellent Georg Frölich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The love for the Augsburg church expressed by Haller in the last of his three letters and his willingness to even face death for it are entirely in the spirit of the apostles! May Christ strengthen him! The dangers and hardships, as well as the deceitfulness and inconstancy of so many, which Haller laments, were already foretold by the Lord, who emphasized that this is only the beginning of the end and only the steadfast will be saved. Haller should adhere to the enlightening word of the Lord in all things!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] How good it is that in his latest letter from March 14 [not received], he reported on the victory of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony over Margrave Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach (in which battle many nobles died or were captured)! For in Zurich, they did not know whether the news was true.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] If Michael Keller and Wolfgang Musculus are expelled from Augsburg because of the Gospel, Haller should tell them that they are welcome in Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] At the last day in Baden [on March 28], King Francis I of France requested mercenaries according to the [pay] alliance [of 1521 with the Five Places]. However, he refused to inform the Five Places where the mercenaries were to be deployed. Lucerne, Schwyz, Zug, and Nidwalden would have granted him the mercenaries if Uri and Obwalden had agreed. Therefore, Francis I is to be given a definitive answer only at a day in Solothurn, on Sunday Quasimodo [April 17]. Then the king will also pay the outstanding debts. It is likely that a major campaign will ensue, which according to some will lead to Milan, according to others to the Netherlands.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] From a letter from Chur [No. 2871], Bullinger learned that about 7000 Italians had set out for Milan and Trento to move to Germany, and it is not yet known whether the Venetians will let them pass. However, this news is not confirmed.</p>

      <p>I received three letters from your charity while I was preparing this response. If the priests are reinstated in full (which may the Lord prevent!), I advise you to write everything to our council and to request that they open a way for your return, by writing letters to the Augsburg council, asking them to recall you and to ensure your safe passage, unless there are so many faithful and holy ones who do not want the church once gathered to be dispersed and ask you to stay with them. For the apostle established churches in many cities (as the Acts teach), and taught in churches in cities where there were both synagogues of the Jews and detestable temples of the pagans. You will always consult the word of the Lord, the example of the prophets and apostles, and finally the counsel of the most excellent and holy man, Georg Frölich.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I am very pleased that in your last letters you testify to your love for the Augsburg church and your readiness to die for it in the Lord, provided that it is cared for and preserved in the truth of faith. This is truly an apostolic voice! May the Lord Jesus strengthen you in this noble purpose of your spirit. As you announce and lament the dangers, the treachery of many, the disturbances and trepidation, and finally the wavering of not a few, you must remember the words of the Lord, who predicted all these things in the gospel. He also added: "These are the beginnings of sorrows! He who endures to the end will be saved." Therefore, I urge your piety to console yourself with these words, and to look solely to the word of the Lord in all things. "For it is a lamp to our feet and a light to our paths."</p>

      <p>You wrote your last letter on March 14. In it, you report the victory of the Elector over Brandenburg, in which many counts and noble men were partly slain, partly captured. I give thanks to our Lord, who does not forsake His people forever. You did a good thing by announcing this victory! For among us, there was doubt whether the rumor was true.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You will securely offer all our things to Michael Keller and Wolfgang Musculus, if they are exiled from Augsburg for the proclamation of the truth.</p>

      <p>In Baden, however, there was (again) a day. The Frenchman desires mercenaries according to the alliance. However, the Five Places want to know where he will deploy them. The Frenchman does not want to say and demands (insists) strongly. Lucerne, Schwyz, Zug, and Nidwalden would have agreed now if Uri and Obwalden had agreed. Thus, a day is set in Solothurn on Quasimodo Sunday. There, a final answer will be given; there he will pay the outstanding debts and lay the charges. Be aware, there will be a great campaign, some think in Milan, others in the Netherlands.</p>

      <p>This is not certain: However, about 7000 Italians are said to have come to Milan, towards Trento. They are moving into Germany. It is not yet known whether the Venetians will give them passage. This is what is written to me from Chur. God be with you!</p>
