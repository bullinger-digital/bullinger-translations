    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks with his brother [Thomas Blarer] for the letter [No. 1590] with the mourning poem [Rudolf Gwalther's on the sister Margaretha Blarer] as well as for the comforting words. Thanks also to the excellent poet Gwalther. Margaretha Blarer's death, as Bullinger wrote, is to be attributed to God's will and a blessing for her, yet a loss for all to whom she was like a mother; may God not let the servants of his church die further! They had no certain news of the death of [Jakob] Bedrot, but Bucer recently wrote that he was ill. Sends the records [from the Diet of Regensburg] and [Johannes Lening's dialogue on polygamy] with a request for comment and return. Greetings; [Thomas Blarer] would like to write a mourning poem as well as Georg Vögeli, but it is questionable whether one should wait for publication until all are united. Further greetings. The plague neither decreases nor increases, so one must fear a longer duration.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Brother Thomas and I have received your letters with the mourning poem, new testimonies of that supreme and long-proven love of yours towards our family, my venerable and more than dearest brother in the Lord, and it seemed right to write nothing else now than that we will strive, as much as we can, to show our gratitude to you on some occasion. You have certainly overwhelmed us for a long time with various great and remarkable acts of your most sincere friendship, so much so that we are almost unable to bear it, since nothing shines forth from anywhere by which we might be able to reciprocate your many merits towards us. But we hope that someday, with heaven's favor, we will achieve our desires and clearly show you that none of these things have been in vain.</p>
      <p>You will also fulfill our duty to the most illustrious Gwalther, the most fortunate poet of our age, whose learned and most delightful muse and wonderfully flowing numbers captivate us beyond measure. Indeed, even Alexander the Great would not be ashamed of this Homer, if he were celebrated by him. You will convey to him, in our words, the greatest thanks you can, while also allowing us to express and, what we desire more, to return these to him; now we do not even have time to write to this excellent man.</p>
      <p>As for what you write piously about our sister, it is entirely true. We do not oppose the will of the best Father, by which we know she has been so happily and eternally cared for. If we consider ourselves, we cannot help but grieve greatly, for she performed not only the duties of a sister but also all those of a most pious mother, and yet we prefer to grieve for our own loss here rather than envy her the supreme good she now enjoys. But in the meantime, we must earnestly pray to the Lord that he does not allow his church to be deprived of such useful brothers and sisters, the most chosen propagators of his glory. For into what inconveniences, I ask, will we be involved, into what darkness, if this plague, as it has begun, continues and extinguishes those lights that shine in this world in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, and to what end, I ask, should we live, when those who truly live by faith and in whom alone Christ lives, are taken from the earth? But this is the merit of this most ungrateful world, which will soon pay the most terrible penalties for its blindness and treachery, being sent into outer darkness. Therefore, let us strive with all our hearts towards that light inaccessible to flesh and blood, whom Christ chose us to be his own from the world, when there is nothing further to hope for here, for which it might be pleasant to live. My spirit foresees the dreadful devastation of our entire Germany, of which we now see not trivial beginnings. May the Lord deliver us as soon as possible!</p>
      <p>We have learned of the death of Bedrot, a remarkably learned and good man, from no certain news; but Bucer recently informed us in his letters that he was afflicted with this disease. We pray to the Lord that all of you, fellow ministers, may be well and continue to be so for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>I am sending the first part of this poorly coherent concord; the latter part, since the messenger left Strasbourg while it was still in the press, we have not yet received.</p>
      <p>You also receive a dialogue, about which I do not pronounce anything, because I have not yet fully understood this matter. When you have first read it, return it, but not without your judgment, which I certainly value greatly in these matters.</p>
      <p>In Zwickau, they greet you reverently and most lovingly with my brother, who would also have written, had he not been delayed by very serious public affairs. He, along with me, expresses the greatest thanks to you and our Gwalther for the exceptional and more than golden gift, which will live for a very long time, striving that such great generosity may be responded to, if not according to its dignity, then at least according to our smallness. He is also contemplating a mourning poem, which our physician Georg Vögelin is doing with no less diligence and grace; but neither has yet completed his, so I do not know whether the publication should be delayed until all can be combined.</p>
      <p>Commend us to the best and most excellent men, Mr. Conrad Pellican, Leo, Theodor, Megander, and the other ministers of the church, and especially greet your wife with the whole household most carefully in my and my family's words, with whom you diligently intercede with the Savior Christ for us. Indeed, we consider nothing more precious in these calamities of affairs than the prayers and communion of the saints. Farewell, venerable and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>In Constance, December 14, 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>The plague among us is so balanced that it seems neither to diminish nor to increase its strength, so it is thought to linger longer. May the Lord do what is good in his eyes, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and most venerable and dearest brother of all.</p>
