      <p>I received your letter written on June 22 at the beginning of August.</p>
      <p>A booklet has been published among us, titled Apologia; in which it is shown why we have departed from the Pope to Christ, and why we refuse the Council of Trent. It may be that two booklets have been published, but I have only seen this one.</p>
      <p>I have instructed my servant to search in London for either one or both, if indeed there are two, and to deliver them to Birckmann to be sent to Froschauer at this fair. Those who live in London seem to have forgotten their duty, as they do not send such books to you.</p>
      <p>If the Archbishop of Canterbury had not sent one to me, I would not have seen any yet. There is in my Norfolk a venerable old man, an excellent preacher, and an ancient enemy of the Antichrist; the Brentian opinion came into his hands, which, when he read it, he embraced with both hands, indeed even vigorously and stubbornly defended it against some pious and learned men. When this was brought to my ears, I sent him your response, which you gave me as a gift; which, when he had diligently read it, he returned to me, first thanking you for publishing such a writing, then me for lending it to him for a few days: for now he has said farewell to the Brentian opinion, embracing the truth with you as the author. I believe he is almost ninety years old; whom I have never seen, for he is far from me: he can hardly ride, indeed he can barely walk. In the church he presides over, he preaches constantly.</p>
      <p>If you have compiled your sermons on Jeremiah into one volume, you have done well in my judgment. I wrote to our Gwalther about the queen's fleet and the English soldiers; also about the letters that the wretched Burcher wrote to me, etc. Four days ago I received letters from the most illustrious Archbishop of Canterbury. The gist of them is this, that I should diligently, by all means possible (yet secretly), inquire who and how many in my diocese do not favor pure religion, (I think they will pay the penalty for their treachery). This I will do diligently and inform them as soon as possible about the enemies of Christ. This pleases me greatly; for from this I gather that the most illustrious Archbishop of Canterbury wishes to adhere steadfastly to true religion. May God grant it!</p>
      <p>Greet in my name your excellent wife, sons, daughters, daughters-in-law, sons-in-law, relatives, Haller, Wolf, Frisius, Collin, Wick, Pellican, Meier, Froschauer, etc.</p>
      <p>Mine to you all.</p>
      <p>When I had written this, behold, news is brought to me that the cross and candlesticks in the royal chapel have been broken and, as someone reported, reduced to ashes. May the cross go to the evil cross! It stood there too long, to the great lament of the pious, while the papists conceived some hope from it, I know not what. Furthermore, the pseudo-bishops who are in the Tower of London will soon give an account of their treachery; so I hear. Farewell, most excellent Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Hastily at Ludham, August 20, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
