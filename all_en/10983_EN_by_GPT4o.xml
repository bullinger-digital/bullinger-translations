    <p xml:id="regest1">Wishes Thomas Blarer all the best in his new position [as Mayor]. Some canons of Constance recently approached some councilors of Zurich from Überlingen and asked for mediation between them and Constance, hoping that a coexistence like in Strasbourg could become possible; the Zurich councilors did not agree and will not undertake anything if it would be unpleasant or harmful to Constance. Requests a response; greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>Pious, honorable, wise, and gracious, dear sir, I wish you from God much health, happiness, wisdom, steadfastness, justice, and discretion in your God-ordained office and pray to our Lord Christ that He grants you to preside over the honorable city of Constance for a long time with honor and salvation. If I can now assist in such a Christian work and serve you, you shall always find me willing and entirely at your service.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I have also been moved to present the following matter to your wisdom: It has happened in recent days that some of your canons, who once sat in Constance, are now in Überlingen and have sent word to some of my lords, the councilors of Zurich, expressing their wonder that no one intervenes to mediate between them and the city of Constance. Our response was: "There is no need to speak of it; for you want to have mass and pursue your ways; therefore, no one helps you." They replied: "No, if only we could come into a conversation with them, perhaps they would treat us like the city of Strasbourg treats theirs," etc. On such a proposal, ours did not want to negotiate further or offer themselves. And yet they considered it good to inform you of such a matter through me. From whom I also understood well, if your honor and benefit could be involved and it were to be expected, they would spare no effort, cost, or labor. But if misfortune or harm to the divine word were to arise from it, or if it were not pleasing to the city of Constance, they would not burden themselves with the matter at all. Who knows, however, whether they might perhaps be divided among themselves through the occasion and accept some appropriate mediation proposals, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I request an answer from your wisdom, if possible. I also ask that you kindly accept this my writing, for it is done out of loyalty. You know what to do in this matter. May God faithfully protect you. I wish you much good and [---] from my lord Mayor Röist, etc.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, February 2, 1537.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, prudent, and wise Thomas Blarer, Mayor of Constance, his gracious, dear lord.</p>
