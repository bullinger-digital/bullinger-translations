    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Vadian has nothing new to report, except that the plague has broken out throughout all of Swabia. In Ulm, many people are dying. Within three days, there were 117 deaths. Even the mercenaries of the imperial garrison are almost completely laid low. In Augsburg, the plague is spreading rapidly. The troops have been ordered out of the city. It will bring renewed suffering to the poor rural population, who will be deprived of their grain and hay.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The regiment of Captain Nicolò von Madruzzo has marched to the residence of Emperor Charles V and demanded the outstanding wages of the last three months. The captain's reputation was damaged by the mercenaries in the process. Eventually, the unrest could be appeased. The Emperor did not withstand it well. Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony offered the Emperor to risk his life for him at the outbreak of the unrest. The Emperor is said to have received this very favorably. The Elector enjoys numerous privileges and wins a lot of money in gambling. He is said to have won several thousand guilders in a game against Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, Duke of Alba. This sparked the unrest, as the mercenaries loudly complained that there was money for gambling, but not for their pay.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] It is rumored that the Spaniards would be willing to move the Reichstag to Strasbourg if the plague in Augsburg became overwhelming.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Bishop of Augsburg, Cardinal Otto Truchsess von Waldburg, is performing true miracles with alms and monetary gifts! He probably wants to make himself popular with the common people. In the cathedral, the auxiliary bishop of Mainz, Michael Helding, preaches. He proceeds very politely and wisely. He insults no one. However, his discourse largely agrees with that of the Pope.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The Augustinian prior Johannes Hoffmeister, who preached his faith in Ulm and denounced the reformatory doctrine as heretical, has been called to Augsburg. But when he came to the nunnery in Günzburg, he was struck by the plague and soon died. He is said to have publicly admitted that he had been persuaded to act against the recognized truth. He is said to have shown remorse and earnestly asked God for forgiveness for his transgression.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The Emperor has placed Magdeburg under the imperial ban. For what reason, Vadian cannot say.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Elector Maurice of Saxony has come first to Munich, then to Augsburg with Margrave Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach. It is said to be his great concern to free his brother-in-law, Landgrave Philip of Hesse, who is still being held in Neuburg an der Donau [correct: Donauwörth], from captivity.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] From Antwerp, it is written that France and England are hostile to each other. Presumably, Pope Paul III is behind it, who leaves nothing undone to regain his fiefs and incomes in England and to prevent the proclamation of the Gospel. Such intrigues are common. May God bring salvation! It is to be feared that the descendants will be able to write even more and worse about these Charles and Paul than has ever been written about the emperors Julian [called Apostate], Maximinus, Constantius, Diocletian, or [Marcus Aurelius Valerius] Maxentius. The effort to report on it will probably be worthwhile, as one is only at the beginning of the changes instigated by these two. Monks and priests will still accomplish astonishing things so that they can be punished for their lack of willingness to repent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] It is credibly reported that the scholars in Spain have sent the Emperor an opinion, in which it is explained at length that the Emperor has the power to convene councils and initiate a church reformation even without the Pope. Such an effort for something so self-evident! If only they had added that such an Emperor must be Christian and orthodox!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Greetings to Bullinger, and may he read the letter to the mayors, to whom Vadian sends his regards.</p>

      <p>S. Nothing new with us, most illustrious Bullinger, except that the plague is breaking out throughout all of Swabia. In Ulm, many people are dying; in three days, 117 people have died, and even the mercenaries of the garrison are almost completely laid low. In Augsburg, it is beginning to spread rapidly. The troops have been ordered out of the city; however, it will go against the poor people and spoil their grain and hay.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The regiment of Captain Nicolò von Madruzzo has fallen upon the Emperor's residence. They immediately demanded their pay for three months, which was not fully paid to them. Captain von Madruzzo was damaged by the mercenaries, and eventually, the unrest was settled. The Emperor did not withstand it well. The Elector offered the Emperor at the beginning of the unrest to risk his life for him. This is said to have pleased the Emperor very much. The Elector is well regarded and wins a lot of money in gambling. He is said to have won several thousand guilders from the Duke of Alba; after which the unrest arose and the mercenaries complained that there was money for gambling, but none to pay them!</p>

      <p>The Bishop of Augsburg is performing wonders with alms and giving away money. He seems to want to gain favor with the common people. In the cathedral, the auxiliary bishop of Mainz preaches.

      <p>Elector Maurice of Saxony has first come to Munich, then to Augsburg with Margrave Albrecht. It is said he is in great concern to free his brother-in-law, the Landgrave, who is still being held in Neuburg, once and for all.</p>

      <p>From Antwerp, it is written that France and England are at odds. It is believed to be the Pope's intrigue, who leaves nothing undone to regain his fief and the great income he had from England, and to hinder the Gospel. Thus, everything goes with intrigues. May God save us. I do not doubt, however, that our descendants will write more and greater and more serious things about these Charles and Paul than has ever been written about any Julian, Maximinus, Constantius, Diocletian, or Maxentius. And it will be well worth the effort, for it is only so far (as I fear) that the attack has been played. Monks and priests will still accomplish wonders, so that they may be punished for their lack of repentance, etc.</p>

      <p>It is credibly reported that the scholars in Spain have sent the Emperor a consilium, in which it is explained at length that an Emperor, in the measure and order of councils and church reformation, is above the Pope. A knot sought in a rush, as if even children did not know this! If only they had added that such an Emperor must be Christian and orthodox!</p>

      <p>Farewell and, I pray, read this to the mayors, to whom you will commend me as to most loving lords and friends. St. Gallen, 10th day of September in the year of our Lord 1547.</p>
