    <p xml:id="regest1">Did not manage to send the promised excerpt of the letter earlier to the recipient who was at the Diet in Baden; on [Sunday] he was unwell, and yet he was fully occupied with preaching, pastoral care, and school matters at the Fraumünster (in the presence of schoolmasters and [Rudolf] Stoll). The pastor of Zofingen [Peter Schnyder] reported what the treasurer of Zofingen [Hans Span] had communicated to him on June 18 in Aarburg, namely that during a meal in Königsfelden, in a conversation with the Schaffhausen resident [Thomas] Spiegelberg, he had to hear from a sitting member of the Zurich Great Council how the latter approved of so many from the Zurich area enlisting as mercenaries in the service [of King Francis I.]; furthermore, Spiegelberg justified the forthcoming response of Schaffhausen and the Seven Places to France's request for mercenaries; that France has an agreement with the Turks is as little concerning as the seeking out of the Jewish doctor [David] by the sick preacher of Schaffhausen [Simprecht Vogt]. Greetings from Vadian, who has conveyed news about the Turks soon to invade Austria and a writing on the unrest instigated by the Bishop of Eichstätt [Moritz von Hutten] in Nuremberg.</p>

      <p>To the pious, honorable, prudent, and wise Hans Rudolf Lavater, treasurer in Zurich, currently a council envoy at the Diet in Baden, his kind, dear lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>My willing service, friendly greetings, and whatever I could do to honor, love, and benefit you beforehand. I ask you, especially kind lord and dear godfather, not to be angry that I did not send you the requested note yesterday. For, besides being quite exhausted from the sermon, I was so plagued by people that I never thought of it again. In truth, from the meal until about four, I had no respite due to people and business, both at home and at the Fraumünster, with the schoolmasters and Master Stoll. Only then did it occur to me what I had forgotten and neglected.</p>
      <p>This is the matter you requested, and thus the preacher from Zofingen wrote: "On the 18th day, our lord treasurer and I dined together at Aarburg Castle. There, he sorrowfully reported how Spiegelberg from Schaffhausen had dined with him at Königsfelden; he boasted how Schaffhausen would also break out to help the Seven Places. The treasurer said: 'Why would you help someone who has the Turk with him?' Spiegelberg replied: 'Our preacher is sick and has sent for the Jew; the king does the same' etc. A member of the Zurich Great Council was present. He said: 'When as many from Zurich are out of the country as have gone, then it will be good, and the matter will proceed.' The treasurer asked: 'But what do the preachers say about it?' To which the Zurich member replied: 'They are against it, but we do not care' etc. Therefore, the treasurer is concerned about a bad practice that might be among you" etc.</p>
      <p>That is the extent of the matter. You can now act as you see fit and beneficial. The matter is in itself; if it happened in Königsfelden, it is bad enough, and it is worth inquiring about.</p>
      <p>God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, June 23, 1544.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>Last night, my lord mayor from Watt wrote to me and instructed me to greet both lords and you; and he writes that they have reliable news from Hungary that the Turk, 80,000 strong, is already prepared for Austria, where there is little defense; and they fear a cruel invasion. Also, some unrest has arisen in Nuremberg due to the bishop of Eichstätt; however, it is being hushed up etc. I have given the writing to the lords.</p>
      <p>God protect you.</p>
