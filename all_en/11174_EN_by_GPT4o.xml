    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has become a promoter of all believers through his Christian writings, as evidenced in his commentary on Paul's letters, which Bertlin, his fellow citizens, and former Erfurt classmates highly appreciate. [The Bishop of Augsburg] is a great threat to Bertlin and the Reformation in Füssen; he hopes for intercession for him and his community and wishes Bullinger, his family, and the Zurich church all the best. He requests Bibliander's work on measures and weights in the Bible, the Nahum commentary, Bullinger's "De origine erroris," as well as news about further publishing projects of the Zurichers. God will punish pride and ingratitude; it is said that [Emperor] Charles will come to the aid of his own. He asks for a response. Gervasius Schuler told him much about Bullinger and encouraged him to be strong in faith; Bertlin will visit him soon.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Christ, our only mediator.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>I pray through Christ himself that you, most learned Bullinger and dearest to my heart, who diligently watches over the Christian republic, may kindly consider this my impudent boldness, by which I trouble and disturb you not once, but again with my unpolished letters. But I must confess, I see in you a spirit so disposed by the gift of God that it desires to benefit all, dedicated to helping and promoting all good and pious people. You ask, where have I seen this? In your holy, learned, chaste, and briefly truly Christian style. Since, according to the ancient saying, style is the most certain index of the mind, it places all these things most manifestly before the eyes, not only to me but also to many of our fellow citizens, once my dearest comrades in the Erfurt study, now steadfast brothers in the business of Christ, who, having returned to sacred studies, turn over Paul, commended and illustrated by your learned and pious commentaries, by night and by day, although they seek their livelihood with their hands, which they often report to me, they give thanks to God, extol, praise, and proclaim his gifts, and so they pray with me to the Father through Christ, that he may continue in you with his spirit what he has begun. Amen.</p>
      <p>Christ, recently preached among us, has led the wise men from afar by the star of his word. Herod consults with the scribes and Pharisees, rages, and plots. The angel of the Lord is present, admonishing his own to leave behind turbulent impiety and withdraw to safer, pious, heavenly things. Grant, O Father, that we may follow better things when admonished. I speak nothing feigned, Christ knows, I have long expected chains and prisons. But in these, and even now writing, I am admonished by the faithful to flee.</p>
      <p>But I say with pious Abraham: "The Lord will provide for himself a victim." Therefore, I will pray without ceasing to the Father, that he may help me, a little shepherd, however little, and strengthen me with his holy spirit together with his little sheep, not mine.</p>
      <p>You will also pray for me and the little sheep entrusted to me, most pious Bullinger, and farewell in the Lord and continue in your holy labors, vigils, and toils for the progress and honor of his holy church. I constantly pray that your wife with your children and the whole family, indeed your entire church, may fare well and prosper in Christ.</p>
      <p>Theodor Bibliander, your own, once promised in the exposition of the last chapters of Ezekiel to write about measures, weights, and other such things brought in from the sacred writings here and there. I pray that through this my faithful Peter, I may receive from the bookseller together with the commentaries on the prophet Nahum. Good God, how I wish to have your books "De origine errorum" and all your other works. Peter will pay for everything. If you or yours have produced any pious works, let me know, dearest Bullinger, and I will have them at the settled price.</p>
      <p>The Lord has taken up the rod of his fury, Sennacherib or rather Nebuchadnezzar's fork, to break our pride, stiff neck, and ingratitude. Charles, as they report, will come defending his own. Watch, O shepherd of Israel, over your own.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and forever, my uniquely beloved Bullinger, and if your holy affairs permit, write back.</p>
      <p>From Füssen in the Alps, on the 8th of the calends of June, in the year 1538 after the salvation of the world was published.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient disciple Bartholomäus Bertlin.</p>
      <p>A few months ago, I was with Gervasius Schuler, the ecclesiastic of Memmingen, a man of integrity and learning. He told me much about you; for he claimed to be very well known to you. That good man, having greatly exhorted us to piety, withdrew to his own, and soon wrote once and again encouraging. I will visit him these days, God willing.</p>
      <p>To the man of integrity and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, faithful and prudent minister of the Zurich church, his lord and teacher to be reverently observed.</p>
