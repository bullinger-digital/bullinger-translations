      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I cannot sufficiently marvel that you have not sent me any letters in this tumult of affairs, where everything is in disarray. The Emperor is seriously ill; perhaps he has a body that does not know how to dissolve. King Ferdinand is in great danger due to the Turkish incursions, which Transylvania fears, as some say, since he has already subjected that entire dominion. We have been deliberating for a long time and especially devising plans against Christ; but the Lord usually devises something else, which usually hinders the consultations of impious men, who establish nothing else than to destroy the word of Christ along with its ministers.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Zweibrücken is consulting with his relatives about liberating the Landgrave; many nobles and barons have gathered in Meisenheim.</p>
      <p>The pious prince has not yet changed anything in the religion once adopted, whom I pray the Lord may render more vigorous and steadfast by His spirit.</p>
      <p>Indeed, it is further said that the Diet of Augsburg has been postponed until the calends of February.</p>
      <p>Two distinguished brothers have died in these days in Strasbourg, one Kigelius, the other Marcus Heilandt, who once preached the word of the Lord in the Basel region, whom the distinguished Mr. Pellicanus knew well. They labored diligently in the Lord's work and especially fought against the Interim.</p>
      <p>I beseech you, please write if you need anything from my service at this fair; I am ready to execute it willingly.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I wish to know from you what you are now writing or what you will give us this winter for the benefit of the Church of Christ. Few write in our age; all fear the power of him who does not know how to rest until he is overthrown by the Lord and snatched away to the depths. I will soon send the calamity of the Magdeburgers, which is being printed here. Farewell. Basel, November 4, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Gast from the heart.</p>
      <p>You will greet our Mr. Frisius in my name, if he still recognizes me as his own.</p>
      <p>We have nothing from Saxony. I sent your letters to Augsburg to a good friend, who gave them to the courtiers of Duke Maurice, who wish to take care of them most diligently.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church and his dearest teacher.</p>
