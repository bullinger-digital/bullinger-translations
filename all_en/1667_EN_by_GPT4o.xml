      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, all these will inform you about my condition. I have written these few things so that I may not seem to have forgotten you, whom I love and cherish so greatly. Farewell and greetings to you with your whole family, school, and church. May the Lord bless your labors, amen.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, June 27, 1552.</p>
