      <p>Greetings and Peace. Venerable doctor and pastor of the Church of Christ, to my great detriment and that of my studies, it has been a year since I came to Montbéliard, having left other places suitable for my studies due to the hope of a school promised by both the Duke of Stuttgart and the Duke of Chambéry, which has not materialized. I do not know whether this disappointment was without deceit, not only at the beginning in Stuttgart and Chambéry but also here in execution, as they acted as if they were about to establish a school until it became known that my position in Strasbourg had been taken by François Baudouin. Then Count Georg and his people openly declared under written agreements that they did not want me. I had called Baudouin from France at his very humble request, recommended him to the people of Strasbourg, and if he had told me he preferred to be in Strasbourg rather than Tübingen, I would have given him letters specifically for that; but he preferred to secretly take the position so as not to appear to owe me any favor. Then the Count affirmed with his own signature that he had written to the Duke, his nephew, to restore me to Tübingen after the school here did not proceed. It is known what and by whose art things were handled to the contrary. My conscience urged me not to let my talent be buried. Having transported my books to Strasbourg at the beginning of June, I first went to Stuttgart to explain my intention to the Duke of Württemberg, who could not retain me as a private advisor but offered that I choose any place of residence in his domain, as I wished to engage in school activities, congratulating me nonetheless on a pious man (as I thought) being appointed to my place in Tübingen. The Duke wanted me to be his neighbor in Heidelberg and gave me letters of promotion (as did Otto Henry) and brought me to Worms to negotiate with the Elector Palatine. François Baudouin, my former secretary, arrived, desiring (or pretending to desire) the Heidelberg position, to whom I yielded, provided he would accept in Leipzig, where the Landgrave wanted me as his neighbor, about which he wrote to Augustus. The Duke of Württemberg was also persuaded that Baudouin had a recommendation from the wife of the Palatine, the Emperor's niece, which was false, as Baudouin later confessed to me, mocking my credulity. He gave me letters to Elector Augustus, which I entrusted to Wilhelm the Landgrave; but due to his people's fault, those letters were lost. After the assembly was dissolved and the Nassau complaint was reduced to money, I went to Frankfurt, then to the Landgraves, whom I found hunting. By their order, I set out for Kassel on July 25. Then Philip himself, the elder, wrote to Duke Augustus, but the letters were sent on August 12; thus, while waiting for Augustus's response, I wanted to retrieve my books. I received letters from Francis Cramius, a man of great affection and favor in courtly manner, but saying the position was not vacant, yet he hoped Augustus would accomplish something. So I returned with Ludwig the Landgrave, ordered by Wilhelm to wait eight days for Augustus's response in Strasbourg, during which time I should provide for myself. Thus, I became more uncertain about my affairs than before and very anxious, for I did not want to expel Baudouin from Heidelberg, and in the meantime, someone else could have been provided for my old position in Strasbourg. I approached Master Johann Sturm, asking that no one be provided for the Strasbourg position without me. He replied that Baudouin was entirely retained in Strasbourg. Soon I thought I was led into a wide expanse. I followed the princes to the wedding, as I had letters to the Elector Palatine, which I obtained in Ricqueville on the return. I wanted to approach the Elector myself, with the Landgrave accompanying me, and my plan was excellent. For if I had been content with the position said to be offered to Baudouin, I would have obtained it entirely, or if the matter had been false, I would have been done with it at less expense and sooner. But while Sturm and Andernach persuaded me to send a messenger instead, for the sake of preserving dignity, and I reluctantly followed them, not wanting to seem to rely on my own prudence; I was deprived of the princes' letters; that messenger (from Andernach, who had taken it upon himself) consumed both money and time without approaching the prince, but leaving the letters with a certain secretary, who replied that he was occupied with his own affairs and only cheered by Bacchus. Nothing else. Finally, that messenger returned, as if by arrangement, and hid for three days, nor would he have been discovered if not sought out. At the same time, Andernach, who had ordered me to wait for his return for three days, went to Basel. Then, seeing myself thus deprived and deceived and meanwhile sinking more into expenses at the inn, I mounted my horses. I could have approached the Palatine myself and spoken in the name of the princes, who would have ratified it; but I would indeed have had to accuse his courtiers, and winter was approaching with uncertain accommodations. So I hurried to Montbéliard on October 3, to recover borrowed money and some movable goods. Count Georg and his wife, Wilhelm the Landgrave's sister, showed great favor, immediately restoring that sunny house and my former position. For recently, from the report of their people, they had heard how much my counsel in Württemberg affairs had been praised at the court in Dole. So I stayed here, otherwise intending to travel to Paris or perhaps the Pyrenees to the King of Navarre. I have not yet been able to transport my books from Strasbourg due to floods, though they have been packed in barrels since May. Nevertheless, on September 24, I showed myself in Strasbourg, where I could read even from time to time. At the request, I offered one lecture, then two; for I was idle; I extended it without lacking voice or material, and even new material. Some counts and nobles offered a stipend from their own to continue reading; but I would never stay there privately. They said they would follow me, whether I taught in Heidelberg or Tübingen. But things are conducted and carried out very differently at higher levels. They asked me to have those lectures published; I agreed, but I will not dictate again until I have a skilled scribe. I have never been more reluctant to write and grow more nauseated by the day. If indeed there are things that were said about Gribaldo, it will be a disgrace not only to the author Vergerio (who caused me to be overlooked here while sweating for the promised school) but also to the Duke who exposed it. The Strasbourg position, which I had obtained 26 months ago and had prudently preferred to the safer Tübingen (two years ago), I left not without great and just, though deceptive, cause, driven by the desire to support my family, which I could not do with the support of the people of Strasbourg, but with the princes' support, whom I approached with successful outcomes. The Duke of Württemberg and the Landgrave of Hesse tried in vain to retain me. I wanted to remain in Strasbourg permanently. But having returned there, with Jakob Sturm having died in the meantime, there was no suitable person to carry the letters of the electors and princes to the French, so with that reason expressed, having obtained leave from the senate, I approached the Duke of Württemberg, who had promised everything if I returned to him, but his negligence once overturned all my diligence. Nevertheless, I continued to adorn that school and purify it from papacy, intending to remain permanently (as was my mind). But as I saw the conspiracy of rabbis and papists to prevent the establishment of a doctoral house, printers, and places for gathering students, so that even the prince (at the end of July, with Vergerio interceding) responded that he did not care about this, I immediately decided I should go to Marburg, where all these things were available; for I trusted the great promises of the Landgrave, who had almost forcibly retained me in Marburg, stipulating that I should not commit myself elsewhere for more than two years, so that I could return to him sooner. Then I saw the French church established in Frankfurt, by which favor of the Landgrave and Augustus I could call my family, and if Frankfurt had had this while the Landgrave was urging Marburg, I would have certainly stayed in Marburg, then because it was certain that as long as I remained in Tübingen, nothing would ever be done about supporting my family, I had very serious reasons for considering Marburg, about which I wrote twice to the Landgrave and when I had meanwhile negotiated for leave and had no response from the Landgrave against all hope, I easily accepted the Montbéliard position in hope of family and school and shortly after the victory against papacy held by the school, I did not want to change my mind, having already sent letters to have Baudouin substituted in my place. Now I seem to be freed from the zeal... and the sting of conscience, which urged me to teach in Germany; but it seems to me that the time is clearly approaching when the Sequani will need Swiss support. They negotiated six months ago for me to teach in Dole, stipulating that I declare in writing that I accept the Pope's decrees and will not contradict them; I would send a copy of the response I sent to them, if I did not seem to be writing too long a story and abusing your time, let alone my own. But I had omitted the reason why 14 months ago there was no response about Marburg, which I learned from one of the princes was the ambition and slanders of Oldendorp, who, fearing the glory he thinks he reigns with there would be endangered, acted with the elder Landgrave to completely dissuade him, whom he once persuaded of bigamy (which he also retains today). Greet the friends... Farewell.</p>
      <p>Montbéliard, November 5, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Charles du Moulin.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, Master Ulrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
