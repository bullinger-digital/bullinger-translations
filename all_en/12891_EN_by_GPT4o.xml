    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Bullinger is glad that Konrad Zwick is satisfied with him and prays to God for success. From now on, he no longer needs to know everything [about the attempt to persuade Francis I to offer assistance to Constance]. God willing, the secret councils of Zurich and Constance will come to an agreement. The people of Constance should also be aware that it is not a given that the councilors of Zurich have engaged in negotiations with Francis I. No one other than Constance could have persuaded them to do so. This shows how well-disposed Zurich is towards the people of Constance, as long as they act accordingly. Greetings to Zwick. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] The secret councilors have today deliberated on how to negotiate with the [French] messenger [Guillaume Du Plessis, sieur de Lyancourt] who has just arrived. However, Bullinger has not yet met any of the secret councilors since he did not leave the house today, Saturday, as he was preparing [the Sunday sermon]. Only the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs] informed him after the meeting that he [the city messenger Georg Müller] could also take a letter for Constance with him if he wished. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] Zwick is absolutely right in his view that any peace with Emperor Charles V can only be rotten. May God confirm the people of Constance in this attitude, for the Emperor will not adhere to any peace! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest4"> [4] That the XIII Cantons [at the Baden Diet] decided [not to tolerate an attack by the Emperor against Constance from Swiss soil] is no small sign of friendship! Not long ago, even 20 years ago, some of these cantons would have rather helped to besiege the city! If the opponents of Constance learn of the decision of the XIII Cantons, it will only be to the city's advantage. Therefore, it should be content with this for the time being. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest5"> [5] Nothing has been heard in Zurich about Sultan Suleiman I. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest6"> [6] A Frenchman traveling from Basel to Venice [...] reported that in Basel they had heard from Strasbourg that the two sent to the Emperor from Strasbourg [Mathis Pfarrer and...] had returned and now [through the peace agreement with the Emperor any hope of an alliance between Strasbourg and Francis I.] was destroyed. Landgrave Philip of Hesse is also said to have informed Strasbourg that he had tried in vain to seek peace with the Emperor, which is why he wanted to seek such with arms and encouraged Strasbourg to do the same. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest7"> [7] Bullinger will forward Blarer's information to Hans Schöner. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest8"> [8] It seems that [Zurich] will not grant Captain Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz the purchase [of Dübelstein Castle]. Nevertheless, he should submit a purchase application to the seller [Gotthard Richmut] to receive a clear answer. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest9"> [9] Hans Widenhuber wrote to Rudolf Gwalther that the people of Zurich are suspected of wanting to harm Constance. Gwalther replied that Zurich only wants and does the best for Constance, but the resistance comes from elsewhere, as Blarer also knows. Gwalther did not write that the problem lies with Constance. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest10"> [10] Bullinger has received back the three [letters sent to Blarer for reading]. If Philip II wanted to leave Spain, he would be immediately driven back! However, the news is false. The Spaniards must not let him leave, for Cheireddin Barbarossa would immediately take them on! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest11"> [11] Bullinger has good reason again to expect better from the Landgrave than the [southern German imperial] cities do. The unjustified hostility between the cities and the Landgrave certainly has its instigator, the devil, who is now also tearing apart the house of Austria belonging to Ferdinand I [through discord]. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest12"> [12] The news [shared by Blarer with letter no. 2841] has been partially read by Bullinger with joy. It is indeed telling that the Emperor had to use such a non-noble monastic fool to punish the cities because no count or other lord could be found at court for this task! Here, God's punishing hand is tangible! And how much the poor people are being exploited! If [Biberach] has to pay a fine of 40,000 florins, Constance would certainly be imposed 80,000 florins! Constance should learn from the damage of others! If the monks had been punished more severely, one would not have to endure such things from them today. They are indeed strange fathers! The Lord will punish them. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest13"> [13] Allegedly, Duke Ulrich of Württemberg has paid homage to the Emperor, sitting in a chair to the mockery of God and men. If only the Lord would hold the Emperor and his followers accountable and punish them! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest14"> [14] The outrage committed by [the riders at Engen against a person from Constance] will anger many who were not yet incensed. God will set it right! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest15"> [15] If only it were true that the army of Margrave Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach had been destroyed! Bullinger also heard about it from the Baden Diet. As soon as Blarer learns more about it, he should inform. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest16"> [16] The Emperor is deeply a papist and insincere person. What he hastily promises or lets slip in conversation, he does selfishly in the Spanish manner and blinds the people with it. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest17"> [17] It is indeed outrageous that [in Ulm] the singing of psalms is forbidden! The preachers will also be monitored more strictly! The godless [Spaniards] truly cannot be trusted. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest18"> [18] Due to his many tasks, Bullinger no longer has time to answer Blarer's questions about the Zurich marriage regulations. Moreover, Mayor Johannes Haab has just arrived. He informs Bullinger that Georg Müller will ride to Constance tomorrow at noon and can take the present letter with him, as the city clerk already offered. Now the messenger [...] Zwick's also arrives. Enclosed is the [“Extract of the most important marriage regulations”]. In it, Blarer will find the answer to his questions. He should return the document to Müller, as Bullinger cannot do without it for long. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest19"> [19] Blessing wish. </p>

      <p>Grace and peace. Since Junker Konrad is satisfied with me, I am content and pray to God that it may turn out well. It is no longer necessary for me to know everything. The secret councils will, God willing, come to an agreement. You should know that you should consider it a great thing that my lords have engaged in negotiations with the French on your behalf! No one else could have persuaded them! Understand also that they have a very good will towards you, as long as you show yourself accordingly, as I trust you will. Greet J. Konrad for me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The secret councils have been together regarding the arrival of the messenger. However, I have not been with any of them yet. The city clerk informed me that if I wanted to write something to Constance, I could do so. Since it is Saturday and I have to prepare for tomorrow, I did not go out.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Your cousin says well, well, well: The peace with the Emperor must be rotten; therefore, I should no longer write about rotten peace, but about no peace! May God confirm you in this (that you do not accept peace with the Emperor), for surely nothing will be kept!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>It seems to me, nevertheless, not to be nothing that the 13 Cantons have decided, as you know, on your behalf. It is a good beginning to greater friendship. A few years ago, even 20 years ago, some would have helped to besiege you! When your opponents hear such things from the Confederates, it will not harm you, etc. I know well that you might rejoice otherwise, but that is for now, until something else also arises.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>We have nothing to know about the Turk, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>From Strasbourg, a Frenchman told me today (coming from Basel, going to Venice) that a message from Strasbourg came out in Basel: The two messengers have returned home and have destroyed everything with the peace. The Landgrave also wrote there that he had sought peace, which he could not obtain; therefore, he wanted to lie with the hand, how he makes peace, and urged Strasbourg anew, etc. But whether this is fundamentally so, I do not know. The aforementioned said so.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I will inform Schöner as you desire.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Regarding Dietrich Marcell, I can still not learn anything else than that it will not be granted. However, he might apply to the one who sold him the purchase, to bring out a thorough decision on how to hold and would in this article.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Widenhuber has written that Zurich is suspected of wanting to neglect Constance, etc. Waltherus replied that Zurich gladly does the best and does it; the matter fails elsewhere and is rotten. He did not write that the matter is rotten with you or among you. Where it has stumbled so far, you know well yourself.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I have received the three letters. If the Emperor's son leaves Spain, he is immediately driven back. But it is nothing. The Spaniards do not let him out; Barbarossa made them good equipment.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>I have again received hope from the Landgrave. Consider, much is said about him from the cities that are innocent. Even if the devil Ferdinand leads and tears apart the bloody Easter house, it is not his cause.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>The new news, shared with me, I have partly read with pleasure. Consider what a disgrace it is that a powerless monastic fool must punish the honorable cities and no count or lord is at court who can do it. It is the hand and open vengeance of God! And, oh, how they exploit the poor people! Surely 80,000 florins would be imposed on you, as 40,000 florins are imposed on this little town. Let others' damage make you wise! Think about it. If they had done to the monks what they deserved, they would not have this from them. They are indeed strange fathers! The Lord's vengeance watches against them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>It is said here that Württemberg has already made the fall. I hear well, he is sitting there on the chair to the mockery of God and men. And may God, that the Emperor and his followers have had enough of the hot bath; be true to them too!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>The outrage committed against yours will anger many who are not yet angry. God will arrange it well!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Oh, if it were true that Albrecht's margrave's army had been destroyed! I heard it just like that from the day of Baden. If you have anything thorough, let me know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>The Emperor is fundamentally and in heart a papist, and nothing upright in him. What he says, hastens and lets fall, he does in the Spanish manner, deceitfully to his advantage, to blind the people and to manage his affairs.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Isn't it a disgrace that psalms are forbidden? The preachers will be imposed more strictly! For there is no truth in those people who are also unfaithful and enemies to God in heaven, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>Now I should answer your questions about marriage regulations. It is truly not possible for me, as the affairs burden me infinitely. Now the mayor Hab arrives. He indicates that tomorrow at 12 noon Jörg will ride to Constance. He should take my letter with the city clerk. Just then J. Konrad's messenger arrives. There, you have most of our regulations. You will find the answer to your questions. Please send them back to me with Jörg, as I cannot do without them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div19" corresp="regest19">
      <p>God be with you eternally. March 12, at 5 in the afternoon, 1547.</p>
      <p>To his dear lord and brother, M. Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
