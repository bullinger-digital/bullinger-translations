      <p>Greetings. When the most distinguished and courteous man, Mr. Morellius, was passing through, he did not deliver the letters written by your kindness; however, upon returning from Italy, he did deliver them. He had placed them in his luggage, which he finally opened in Italy; thus, it happened that he gave nothing in our first meeting. Nevertheless, I easily forgave him this error, as neither of us suffered any loss here. Indeed, I was deprived of joy until now, which has now blessed me abundantly, as I understand that your piety is attempting something. Continue, my lord and brother. May the Lord grant you His Holy Spirit, so that this endeavor of yours may lead to the glory of God and the salvation of many. I now eagerly await your holy labors: but see that you do not hurry and write with some inconvenience. I know you are overwhelmed with many tasks, barely able to sustain them all. Therefore, exercise your otherwise afflicted strength moderately.</p>
      <p>Laelius, as you wrote, has returned to us and now lives among us. He conducts himself modestly. I restrain, as much as I can, the curiosity of the man. The other colleagues do the same, so that he is less troublesome to us.</p>
      <p>Leverus is well, and the other Englishmen are very well, thanks to God, but not without reason are they excessively afflicted by the ingratitude of miserable England. You know that it has received the Spaniard, who initiated his governance with blood, having executed two nobles. They fear that those most holy bishops Latimer, Cranmer, Ridley, Hooper, etc., have already been taken away.</p>
      <p>We must pray continually for that most afflicted church. Mr. Molinaeus sent this note to me, asking that I send it to you through the next messenger. It was delivered to me today.</p>
      <p>I understand that he will not remain long in Tübingen, but will move from there.</p>
      <p>The case of the faithful from Locarno is now being dealt with in the Baden assemblies. Unless the Lord shines His grace upon it, I doubt the happy outcome of affairs. For it will have to be dealt with either by friendly negotiation or by law with 7 republics and 4 cities. But such is the barbarity, ferocity, and hardness of those men that I fear for the good. I see that our people are diligent enough: but in the meantime, I experience daily that their malice is insurmountable. May the Lord, the defender and liberator of His oppressed church, be with us perpetually. When I have certain information about those assemblies, which are not yet finished, I will inform you promptly. Farewell with all the brothers and colleagues, and pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>In Zürich, most hastily, September 9, 1554. Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his most honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
