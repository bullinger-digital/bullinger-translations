    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer did not receive the letter in which Bullinger criticizes the hesitation of the Schmalkaldic League. He can only agree with this and hopes for divine guidance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Bullinger's concerns regarding Francesco di Castellalto are also justified. The Schmalkaldic League was far too slow.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Otherwise, there is hardly any reliable news, except that Maximilian von Egmont, Count of Buren, is currently supposed to be with Emperor Charles V. May God help that one comes out of the matter without disgrace!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- A merchant from Konstanz, Niklaus Kröl, writes from Venice that the Emperor has demanded passage rights and provisions from the Venetians, as well as assistance in the fight against the Protestants. He also demands that they confiscate the goods of the German Protestants. However, they refused this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The people of Konstanz would have gladly sent their preacher with the Zurich pastors Rudolf Schwyzer, Lorenz Meyer, and Thoman Ruman, who have unfortunately already departed for Augsburg. Now he must travel alone. The people of Augsburg have also asked the people of Konstanz for a preacher. However, since Johannes Schnell, Johannes Jung, and Martin Wetzler have already been sent to other places, they can now spare only one.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Why do the people of Bern ask the people of Zurich for a preacher? There are rumors that they want to adhere once and for all to the doctrine of the Lord's Supper, which was discussed, confirmed, and printed during their disputation of 1528. Bullinger should provide more details.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- He should pray, as Blarer will also do.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- He should also help ensure that Hans Schöner receives the letter written by his sister Sabina along with the money.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I received your latest letter, my dearest brother, in which you criticize the hesitation of our people. I wish you could accuse them as successfully as you do justly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I see that the Lord's thoughts are far different, as He wishes to glorify His name not through our strength, but through His own power. You rightly remind me of Francesco di Castellalto. Indeed, I see the remarkable delays of our people in matters where they should have been diligent.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>May the Lord moderate and direct their plans with the wisdom of His spirit! There is nothing new now, as far as I know, that I can inform you of, except that it is consistently said that Maximilian von Egmont, Count of Buren, is already with the Emperor today. We await to hear what will follow. May God grant that we come out of this matter without disgrace and ridicule!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>A merchant from here, Niklaus Kröl, a very honest man, writes from Venice that the Emperor has demanded passage rights, provisions, and that they arrest the goods of all German Protestants. However, they have refused all of this. It is also said that they were asked for help against the heretics.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>It is somewhat regrettable that your people have already left for Augsburg, as we hoped they would come here, so that a good minister of the word from our side could join them as a companion. Now he must travel there alone. The people of Augsburg have also requested preachers from us, but since three are already absent, there is no one left except for that one, whose ministry our church can spare. May the Lord Himself send out workers into His great harvest!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I am very eager to know why the people of Bern are asking you for a preacher. There are rumors that they have decided to adhere to the doctrine of the Lord's Supper, which was discussed and confirmed in their city in previous years. However, nothing certain has been reported about this. I am waiting to hear what you will write about this matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell. Commend us to the Lord with pious prayers diligently and earnestly, as we also do for you and yours in return.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I ask that you ensure the letters addressed to Hans Schöner, which you receive here, are delivered to him. His sister Sabina wrote to him, also adding some money, so that the good exile may live more comfortably.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Again and again, farewell. September 20, 1546. Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>I give you the greatest thanks for the booklet you sent.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
