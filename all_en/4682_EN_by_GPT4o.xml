      <p>Greetings. I received your letters and read them, and I do not see it as greatly important to respond to them.</p>
      <p>Let us fear God, be diligent, and conduct His business faithfully in His sight, praying that He may bless us. Many things in this man displease me; I pray to the Lord that He does not punish our ingratitude and sins through this very person. I cannot write more about French affairs, because I am entirely occupied with completing certain works for the printing press and writing many letters to England, Saxony, Poland, and other places, which can now be sent via merchants preparing to go to Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>Therefore, do not be surprised if there is nothing after eight days. Coignetius just writes that things are going well in France; that the cardinal has left the court. He adds that the Duke of Savoy wanted to destroy the inhabitants of the Val d'Aosta again; but over 800 soldiers from Savoy have fallen. Nothing has been accomplished in Neuburg, except that another assembly has been scheduled to be held on May 18 in Basel, where arbitrators from 11 cantons are to hear the case. I have no certain news from Saxony in Neuburg yet.</p>
      <p>If you have any information about the council and Italian affairs, please share it. Let us pray to the Lord to be with us.</p>
      <p>Farewell. February 28, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church in Chur, his dearest brother. Sent to Chur to Mr. Hans Schmid, pastor at St. Martin.</p>
