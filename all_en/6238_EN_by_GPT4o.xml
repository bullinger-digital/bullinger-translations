      <p>S. I would prefer you to attribute my failure to respond to your letter yesterday to my ignorance rather than negligence; for when the most reverend Bassafontaneus, recently the Bishop of Limoges, asked whether I had conveyed his greetings to you in my letter, I said that I had not sent any letters to you via Vergerius' courier, as he had gone directly to Württemberg via Schaffhausen. However, he, being much more knowledgeable about the routes and regions, informed me of my mistake. Therefore, if the courier has returned to Zürich, you will accept the same excuse for my error that I used with Bassafontaneus; for I would not have failed you in such a trivial matter of correspondence, as I both wish and ought to do the greatest things for your sake.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I immediately wrote this letter, in which you will know that I have recommended Vergerius' business to Bassafontaneus in the best possible terms, especially because I know that you wish well to Vergerius, the pitiable old man.</p>
      <p>If the courier had arrived with Vergerius' letter, so that the money could have been safely given to him, Bassafontaneus would have ensured that the owed money was counted out to him.</p>
      <p>Know, therefore, that we will be in Zürich within three days or at most four, where the money will be deposited with a good man of your choosing until Vergerius' letter arrives, about which I have diligently informed him.</p>
      <p>As you instructed, I greeted Bassafontaneus as accurately and dutifully as possible in your words, so that he would give a clear indication of his love for you and would gladly hear the recollection of your mutual and old friendship. He wanted me to send you his very best regards in his name.</p>
      <p>God willing, we will be together soon.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, most illustrious and learned man, you will fare well and love us.</p>
      <p>Lord Gwalter here will know that I have conveyed greetings from him. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Baden, 6 days before the Kalends of September.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, P[omponne] Bellièvre.</p>
      <p>Thus, Marshal Vielleville, an excellent man, and gradually, with me as a witness, Bassafontaneus have advocated for the cause of the Glareans before the Swiss envoys, so that I have good hope that the Swiss will adopt more moderate plans.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow, they will publicly advocate the same cause in the name of the king. To the most illustrious and learned Lord Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the church of Zürich.</p>
