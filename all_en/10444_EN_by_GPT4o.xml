In Konstanz, the reinstatement of Ulrich in WÃ¼rttemberg has been received with joy, and much is now expected of him regarding the spread of the reformed faith. Greetings. He probably will not be able to write to Theodor Bibliander at the moment.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Just as the blossoms are to the bees, the willows to the goats, and the grass to the streams, so have your little cheeses been to Lopadius. Indeed, the messenger who brought them brought me more joy than a single ship could carry. From this, I infer that the memory of me has not faded from your mind, nor have I been forgotten by you. The matter speaks for itself. Your great kindness towards me demonstrates the love you have for me. You, therefore, are most worthy of being loved in return. I will indeed love you not so much for the gift as for the remarkable virtue and piety that we see resides in you. For love is purchased by nothing more than itself. Who, except the insane, the wicked, or the impious, would not favor you, would not eagerly strive for you, a lover of true religion, a lover of piety and evangelical truth? Nor do I doubt that, above all, Christ, our Lord, wishes you well and favors you, as I understand from many indications that you are led and guided by His spirit. May He direct you in all things worthy of His own gospel. Furthermore, please let me know by letter how much these cheeses cost you, and the amount you mention will be promptly paid. For I am entirely at a loss as to how to repay your kindness and favor.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we rightly rejoice and are glad that Duke Ulrich has been restored to his duchy, and that the war has reached a most desirable conclusion. The Lord has heard the prayers of some and has paved the way for the preaching of the gospel even to this people, who have long been oppressed by unjust levies and heavy tributes. And what was most miserable, there was no way open to them to hear the word of God. And may that prince be as concerned with preaching the gospel to his people after overcoming the enemy as David was with building the house of the Lord. May he prefer to imitate Hezekiah and Jehoshaphat rather than Pharaoh. We have high hopes for him. May the Lord so kindle and inflame the man with His spirit that he burns with no greater desire than to promote true piety and religion.</p>
      <p>I am not permitted to add more, being very busy. May you and your most praiseworthy family fare well. Greet the old friends, Pellicanus, and Theodor, to whom I may not be able to write at present.</p>
      <p>July 7, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Ludwig Lopadius.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, a man distinguished by pious doctrine and learned piety, his dearest brother.</p>
