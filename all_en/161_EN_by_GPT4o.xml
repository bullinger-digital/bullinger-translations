      <p>PRAISE BE TO GOD! Strasbourg, 18th day of June 1548. Greetings! Know that I have finally received your third letter, dearest friend and lord, since my return from my homeland, filled with truly divine exhortations to patience, perseverance, and all kinds of virtues, among many other things contained therein.</p>
      <p>For which I give immortal thanks, and I pray to the Almighty God that He may grant me to imitate what you have rightly advised.</p>
      <p>In the first aforementioned letters, you indeed speak much of Josias Simler, whom you lifted from the sacred font: for whom I am most ready, for your sake, to provide what you ask. However, I do not think it would be to my advantage for him to receive money from me in the future, which should be resolved there, after our Johannes Burcher left you, nor is there any hope left of having funds. Nevertheless, those fifteen florins, which I was going to send you for this year for the purposes you know, if you have received them from his father, I will give the same to his son here, and I will give them whenever he wishes. However, if the young man is in need of money, I will give it to him on the condition that it is sent back to me from you through a trustworthy person.</p>
      <p>In your second letter, you wish to know how the most learned Johannes a Lasco is doing now. What I know about this man's condition, I learned from a certain citizen of this city, to whom he wrote last autumn. At that time, he was still in Emden in Friesland and was well, but he was very sad and amazed with astonishment due to the present state of Germany.</p>
      <p>Now to your third and last letter. I will soon ensure that the book you sent to the Archbishop of Canterbury is delivered safely; however, it can hardly be done before the month of July at our fairs, unless I wanted to send it by courier, which would be very expensive; for each half-ounce, five cruciers must be paid to Antwerp, besides the transport from there to the archbishop. If it had been brought even an hour earlier, I would have sent it through a certain Antwerpian at a low cost, who was then at my house.</p>
      <p>It is certain that I wish to return to England, God willing, with my wife and children for the autumn Frankfurt fairs. I am grateful for your friendly prayers that God may favor our journey. You also wish to know how and through whom you can write to our people in my absence. Our mutual friend Johannes Burcher will most conveniently send our letters. For we have decided to conduct business together for two or three years, or even longer, if it seems appropriate; and for this reason, he has bought a convenient house here, which he will first inhabit after he returns from the upcoming Frankfurt fairs. You can also learn about the affairs of the English through Mr. John Hooper as conveniently as possible, as long as he remains with you: to whom and to his pious wife, I ask you to convey my greetings. Also, greet the most learned Mr. Theodor, Mr. Pellican, Dr. Gesner, the pious matron, once the wife of Megander, and your wife very much. My wife also sends heartfelt greetings to all the aforementioned, but especially to you and your wife.</p>
      <p>The latest news I received from England is this: namely, that some have dared to take a second wife while the first is not yet dead but merely divorced, indeed even to have two wives at once. This license has been prohibited by a public edict of the king and council, as it should be. The chancellor, as they call him, of the kingdom, in a speech made in the name of the king before the judges of the whole kingdom, warned them to seriously consider such cases. There are also papists who have tried to incite the people against the king and the nobles of the kingdom with false lies. These lies are: namely, that the king wants to burden the people with a new and unheard-of kind of tax, so that whoever marries a wife would pay half a crown to the king; also for baptizing an infant and burying the dead, and various other most mendacious things of that kind. Against these, he also inveighed very strongly, urging the judges to quickly address these lies and punish the authors of errors and crimes. I received this speech along with the edict at the end of May and sent it long ago to our friend John Butler, so that after reading both, he might send them to Mr. John Hooper, who could explain them to you in Latin. Otherwise, they are printed in English.</p>
      <p>Before I sealed this, I received from England that the Bishop of Winchester, Dr. Edmund Redman, and a certain other Robinson were summoned to London by the royal council, I do not yet know for what reason. All the boys and women from Boulogne have been sent away; for there is perhaps some fear that the French will attack Boulogne. However, this month, Mr. de Cobham, the deputy of the royal majesty of England at Calais, wrote to me that he does not fully understand it to be likely that the French want to wage war with our people this year. Furthermore, our people have a great preparation in hand for Scotland and recently conquered a certain town there called Haddington, which is only 12 English miles from Edinburgh, and the English fortify it daily, as well as several other castles in Scotland.</p>
      <p>I commend you, your wife, and children to our only savior and deliverer. Farewell and live long happily in the Lord. Amen.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Richard Hilles.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my special good lord and friend. In Zurich.</p>
