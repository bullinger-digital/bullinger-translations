      <p>Greetings. I received your last letter, in which you console me, for which I give you the greatest thanks; for I indeed needed it; I am greatly troubled, and I await when the Lord will bring an end. I have read your third Decade to the end, and I have reached the sermon on repentance, which I will complete shortly. I marvel at your riches, which you have gathered from the scriptures of God so successfully, arranged so aptly, and presented so abundantly; I await what remains in the 4th Decade; may the Lord also deign to be with you here; for I believe they will be no less successful and pious than the previous ones.</p>
      <p>You certainly have many news from Frankfurt; but what follows has been written to our senate. The Emperor is in better health than ever before, he goes out for a walk two or three times a week; he has established a diet either in Regensburg, Nuremberg, or Augsburg; after consultation, Augsburg was preferred above the others. Therefore, he sent a certain great man to Antwerp, if I remember correctly, to ensure the printing of letters to the states of Germany, which announce the diet for the calends of July. He wrote to the new pope about holding a council in Germany, and he appointed Metz as the place.</p>
      <p>The pope agreed and promised to comply in all things, and having fallen out with the French, he is entirely on the Emperor's side. A certain African king, having been made an exile, calls upon the Emperor for help. So much for these matters.</p>
      <p>By chance today I received Gwalther's sermons against the Antichrist, translated into Italian and printed here, to be sent to Italy, a certain traitor having informed the magistrate of the matter, and today it was discussed; but what was decided, I do not yet know.</p>
      <p>Thus the Italians also wish to recognize the Antichrist from their own, and this cannot but greatly please me. Let us call upon the Lord, that He may someday teach the world that He Himself is Christ, the Son of the living God. Farewell with your family and brothers, especially with Gwalther and Otto, in the Lord. Basel, hastily, April 12, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
