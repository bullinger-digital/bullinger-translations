    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger recommends [again] the Wiler [Thomas Grunder], who delivered Blarer's letter from August 10 [No. 2211]. Blarer should write to the [Zürich] council or to the mayors [Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater] regarding Grunder's matter, and not to Bullinger, who will otherwise gladly continue to support [Grunder]. - Blarer should send back Johannes a Lasco's letter [about the Lord's Supper] through [Grunder]. The [“Defensio verae doctrinae” by a Lasco] should be returned in three weeks. - Bullinger admonishes Konrad Curio [Hofherr] daily and probably with success. - [Kaspar] Megander passed away on August 17 [1545] at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. Blarer should pray for a good successor. - Blarer is requested to report on the outcome of the Diet [at Worms] in German.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. The excellent man Wylanus presented himself conveniently here, to whom I wanted to entrust this letter; he faithfully took care of your letter written on August 10. I commend his cause to you, and if you are going to write anything, write to the magistrate or to both mayors, not to me; otherwise, I will faithfully place my efforts for the man.</p>
      <p>You will send back the letter of Lord Johannes a Lasco to me through him; the Greek and the title are written in the hand of Lord a Lasco. You will send the booklet on the incarnation after 3 weeks, once you have read it. You will say that the man is absolutely learned in sacred matters.</p>
      <p>I remind Konrad Curio daily, and he is not without fruit among us. He lives honorably.</p>
      <p>With great sorrow of heart, I inform you that Mr. Megander, consumed by a long illness, passed away to the Lord on August 17 at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. Pray to the Lord that another good man may succeed him. What was done in the Diet? In German, I beg you to write to me, if you know for certain how it concluded.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you and yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 26, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Ambrosius Blarer. Constance.</p>
