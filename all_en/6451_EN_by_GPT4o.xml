      <p> Greetings. I am very weary, my dearest brother, and almost broken by many sorrows; therefore, if I am brief, you will excuse me. As for the main matter, I have conferred with the councilors, I have conferred with other pious and prudent men, and all promise their efforts. However, since the matter is not ours alone, but of the common Confederates, Zürich cannot act alone by itself; what can and may be done will be done as usefully as possible. The Engadiners have come; but I hear they have shown themselves to be quite inept in the senate. Yet even now they have not given a solid response; they are waiting for more certain information from their own. Meanwhile, they have gone to Zug and I don't know where else. They are said to have returned yesterday; for they had promised to respond on Thursday. In the evening, I was with the councilors, and nothing certain about the response was yet established. Tomorrow the matter will be dealt with in the senate, especially since the envoy and the senate of Chur have written. I am sorry that Friedrich trusted those men; for since they are solely focused on scraping together expenses from everywhere, he will also pay his share here. You do well to say that the matter of Gallicius no longer concerns you, since it has been adjudicated by the most honorable senate; God will eventually find the guilty. You do much better not to wish to engage in any enmity with him, as it is undoubtedly connected with harm to the church. If my mind were not disturbed, I would have recently thanked you for your Response given to me as a gift; but now I beg you to kindly forgive me this fault. I thank you very much for the booklet sent and the other given to Martinengo, who indeed gave me a copy, as he said. The other will thus go to my son-in-law Lavater in your name. I confess that I advised you not to respond to those brawlers; but I wish you had not followed my advice. The book is useful to the church. However, if those buffoons attack you again, see that you are prepared, if they are of such a kind that it is necessary to respond, etc. I have already told you why I do not wish to request the acts from our people; there is no need to repeat it. However, if you can share something during your leisure, you will greatly gratify me. I return to you what you requested, it has not yet been possible to copy, indeed barely to read. You wish to know what the Engadiners have accomplished with the senate; nothing, as I mentioned a little earlier. The King of Spain was supposed to append his seal to the agreement between Savoy and the Bernese; he refused, lest he seem to do wrong to his relative and help to bring about his downfall. Thus I hear everything has gone up in smoke; I expect more certain news. I gave Arnold Suler 14 measures of oats to buy, as he was here; he was supposed to pay me half last Friday, bringing 18 guilders 8 batzen; the other half he is to pay me without fail in 8 or 14 days. He informed me that Jörg Setzstab would settle the half with me. When I sent to him for the money, he was unwilling, and refused me. Yet he comes today and brings me 18 guilders and earnestly asks me to write to Arnold not to leave him and to send him the barrel with rice, as he promised; for he is only short of money, and he has laid it upon me, etc. I ask you to inform Arnold of this and to greet him kindly. Farewell. </p>
      <p> Zürich, 27 April 1565. Greet the councilors, the envoy, etc. Nothing yet from Frankfurt, etc. </p>
      <p> Yours, as always. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius Montanus, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. Chur. </p>
