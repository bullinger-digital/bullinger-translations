      <p>S. D. From the letters addressed to you, most esteemed lord and dearest brother, but found in the street and brought to me by Mr. Christian Hospinian, minister of the church of NÃ¤fftenbach, you will understand from our Gregory Mangold, to whom I entrusted them to be sent to you. I am sending here 26 of my sermons on the first sermon of the prophet Jeremiah and I pray that you kindly accept this, whatever little gift it is, from me. I cherish you and for that reason, I make you a participant in my labors.</p>
      <p>The Lord has so far provided strength in many matters to accomplish what I have completed; now I feel a great decline in all my vigor and strength. Since I know it pleases God this way, I accept it kindly, continually imploring His spirit and grace, etc. The diabolical pope and the instigator of all wars made peace with Philip.</p>
      <p>The first article of the agreement is that Philip, having sent a delegation, should prostrate himself at the feet of the beast, worship, ask for forgiveness, confess his sin, for daring to raise his hand against the most holy father and the most sacred Roman church, just as Duke Alba did before and sought absolution. Fie, devil upon devil, does this not mean that the Antichrist also kissed the backside (is this honor to the ears)? Who would not be moved by the stupor of princes more than Pharaoh's! This truly is to drink from a cup mixed with philters for the kings of the earth.</p>
      <p>Oh, the blind, desolate people, who do not abhor this Babylonian harlot, dripping with the innocent blood of the saints and swelling with the most prodigious treacheries and impostures, and teeming with debaucheries, sodomies, and unspeakable lusts. Therefore, O God, give what you will give, great fool's heads to those who, with the pope's force, want to be his footmen and lackeys. Come, Lord Jesus, and free those who hope in you and await your coming.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the Arno River destroyed the most precious bridges of Florence and scattered the shores, wearing down the entire city so that it is written that Florence will not be the same Florence as it was. The Tiber also, overflowing prodigiously on September 13, inflicted the greatest damage on the city.</p>
      <p>Many people perished, numerous and notable buildings collapsed; filth and stench were left behind, which might blow pestilence upon the blessed fathers, unless they flee, for their constancy and faith. We have not yet heard that the war in Ferrara has been settled, and for that reason, the otherwise well-prepared army of the princes does not move into Piedmont against the French; for it had been so decided. We hear, however, that the Venetians have not been idle in working for peace; for they feel that the war in Ferrara, being close, is connected to their own detriment. In the months of September and October, the excellent and most learned man Philipp Melanchthon wrote to me three times, letters full of piety and love. In them, he explains to me how imprudently and importunately some Saxons have dealt with him. In the last letter, written on October 5 from Worms, he indicates that since they could not obtain the consent of Philipp, Brenz, Pistor, and many other good men to condemn us and our churches, they have laid down their condemnation with the president of the college, Julius, and departed; therefore, he doubts whether the colloquium will proceed.</p>
      <p>If you have any information about what has happened in the meantime, please let me know, I pray. From Augsburg, it is written that the Turkish prince has made a truce with Ferdinand for seven years, and good and prudent men fear that the king will abuse that peace for a severe persecution of the church. France certainly experiences severe persecution in the midst of the fires of war.</p>
      <p>The dragon pours out its conceived fury in Italy through the beast, likewise upon the church; indeed, to make peace between the French and Philip, cardinals Carafa and Trivulzio have been sent, and to diligently act on the reconvening of the council and the uprooting of heresies and heretics from the roots.</p>
      <p>If this continues, we will be rightly dealt with for our quarrels and unchaste behavior, as Eusebius writes at the beginning of the 8th book of ecclesiastical history. We must pray to the Lord that He does not allow the sincere truth to be corrupted and, if anything must be endured, that He preserves our souls in the confession of His name, and likewise sanctifies our bodies. Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, the last day of October, very quickly, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the former Roman passed by here on his way to France to the king. Some of his own household reported that the damage caused by the floodwaters in Florence is estimated at the price of thirty times a hundred thousand crowns, or 30 gold coins. Paul IV burns books in Rome, including all of Erasmus of Rotterdam, from which Cyprian, Jerome, and Augustine are also burned, because they were tainted with Erasmus's notes (as he says, a foul mouth), and to give more pretext or color to his deed, he also burned some books of Boccaccio, likewise Tibullus, Propertius, Catullus, etc.</p>
      <p>If these, why not also cardinals and bishops much more obscene and impure than they? I hope the Lord will come soon and purify this Lernaean Hydra with fire sent from heaven at His longed-for coming. Again, farewell.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Biel/Bienne, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother. To Mr. Ambrosius Blarer in Biel.</p>
