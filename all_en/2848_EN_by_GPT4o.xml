      <p> Greetings. A few days ago, I sent the notes on the Apocalypse, when a reliable messenger presented himself to me, whom I sent without letters because he arrived unexpectedly and at an inconvenient time, and there was no time to write due to his hasty departure. If there is any mistake, forgive me; for since a reliable messenger was present, I did not want to keep what you had lent me any longer, lest your gratuitous kindness be rendered vain by delay. Your holy thoughts delight me greatly, my dear Bullinger, especially because of the wonderful simplicity with which you present such great mysteries of God to the Church of Christ. Who would not willingly and intelligently, and hopefully obediently, listen to them? In my judgment, this present age greatly needs your work. For I see many snoring in impious security, and I also see not a few so deluded by the trifles of the papists, and this by the ministry of Satan, that they either completely ignore the Antichrist or transfer this monstrous idea to some private individual, in whom, however, the fullness of Satan dwells bodily, and who reveals himself so openly that, as it is said, even the half-blind and barbers should know him. I, weary of his wickedness, labor entirely in public sermons so that my people may know and clearly recognize this beast with its disguise exposed, so that those who know the day of the Lord is near may prepare themselves to meet Christ the coming judge. For I hope that this age we live in will not pass without the Redeemer of the world coming to free his own from all vanities, so that, stripped of all the slanders of nature, we may be called clothed in the garment of immortality from above. Therefore, let us not be weary of the labor we have undertaken, beloved brother, which we know will not be unsuccessful in the sight of the Lord and of God, who judges all things justly. We will stand someday, without a doubt, with much boldness before the Lord, reproaching our enemies for their contempt of God and our labor, when we will hear that joyful [Greek]: Come, blessed of my Father, etc. </p>
      <p> To this end, let all our thoughts, all our sighs, be directed by faith, etc. I hear from you that a book has been published and printed, which I am eager to see with great desire. If you have anything left on the Apocalypse, I beg you, send it, if it is convenient for you. You have here a reliable messenger. The church of Locarno recently sent a writing of Master Ochino, which he published against Westphal, the theologian of Hamburg, if it pleases the gods, quite sharp, he fights vigorously, I say, in the field, for establishing or preserving or restoring the trade of the Mass; meanwhile, it does not for a moment divert me from the conceived opinion of truth, so that I am rather strengthened in my purpose by his most foolish lies. For the truth, not needing a foreign cloak, remains unshaken by itself. The Senate of Lenzburg, as it had promised to do, has not yet fully decided on my stipend, but it is in progress, and if it completes it, I will write more fully. For I know that you are not only a companion in my afflictions but also in my happiness. I am doing well with my wife; old age is a disease in itself. Farewell, incomparable friend, and if you have anything you wish me to know, at least write briefly; I, if it seems good to God and heaven is favorable, will visit you; for I can no longer be without you. Pray to the Lord for me. You will greet your wife, beloved in the Lord, along with your whole family, in my name and that of my wife. </p>
      <p> Given at Lenzburg, March 5, 1556. </p>
      <p> Yours, Schuler. </p>
      <p> To the most honorable man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, a lord, brother, and very esteemed old friend. </p>
