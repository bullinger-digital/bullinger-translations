      <p>S. Nothing could have been offered to me more desirable and pleasant, my excellent and perpetually venerable Bullinger, than your letters, both because... and also because I learned that mine were delivered to you. Certainly, there are many things to write to you; but the courier, already booted, gives no time for writing; for immediately after yours were delivered by a certain Ulm messenger, the one from Constance says he is already mounting his horse.</p>
      <p>Culmann, very well known to me and very familiar with my son from the cradle, has not yet come to Augsburg; if he comes, he will feel my goodwill towards him; for he is rightly considered worthy of all the duties of friendship.</p>
      <p>I am sending you the remaining part of the recess of the diet; I do not yet see the papal tyranny being sent back, but rather increased, even though the diet has decreed some things against those who have hitherto worshipped the earthly god.</p>
      <p>I give immortal thanks to our Gesner, to whom I wish these to be common, for the booklet sent; I will read it today, God willing.</p>
      <p>I eagerly await yours. I will make sure that in sending the booklet and other things, which you and Gesner diligently handle for my benefit, you neither waste oil nor expenses. I can hardly express how much joy you have given me when you give hope that you will take care and strive to obtain a tutor for my son, a boy of excellent promise, in Geneva or Lausanne; the boy, 10 years old, is progressing beautifully in Greek and Latin. I would prefer a Savoyard or a Frenchman learned in Latin and Greek rather than a German because of the foreign language, which would be easily absorbed by the boy along with Greek and Latin. I therefore ask, do not... cease, friends, to take care of the matter; if you do, you will not only take care of my two souls, Raphael and Gottfried, but also make me more lively; for if they live rightly, which happens when they are better educated, they also keep me alive. Do not spare expenses; I will repay everything most willingly. Therefore, if it seems good, handle the matter through couriers hired for this purpose either to Geneva or Lausanne and then send them to me, so that I may know in time what I should hope for. I know Calvin will gladly do me a favor. This one matter occupies me day and night greatly, to appoint a more honorable and sound-minded tutor for the boy; I will treat him as a son. Perhaps my indulgence, along with the father's urging, removed Maximilian, full of oestrus, from duty. I hardly dare to say how many and what great disturbances he daily excites; I greatly fear that he may again turn entirely into a fierce one.</p>
      <p>I will compile my experiments into a handbook and send it to my Gesner as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>That you are suffering from poor health, as it was very distressing for me to hear, so I am less surprised, since I know well and experience daily how much damage the affections of the mind bring. The affairs that fall upon you cannot be expedited without the affections of the mind, especially with matters so miserably afflicted. May the Lord preserve you and those like you for His church; for if ever before, especially at this time, the enemy of the human race tries to stir everything up. Yesterday, a most upright man returned from Rome, a nobleman from Comerstat, a counselor of the Elector of Saxony, who says he found in Italy, especially in Rome, horrendous harpies born to destroy the religion of Christ; the pope himself is also a notable and tireless schemer, who diligently tries to impose his creatures, the Jesuits, on the whole world and leaves nothing untried.</p>
      <p>The Jesuits recently had a disputation in Rome, in which, with amazing swordplay and stentorian shouting, they refuted all of Luther's articles. A certain Theobald, formerly the preacher of the Landgrave, opposed them; but that apostate did not handle the matter seriously, as he could have done. The pope will send 6 Jesuits to the Diet of Regensburg. Nothing certain can yet be written about the diet; I fear that the warlike tumults, now swelling, will promote something other than the diet. Franconia is turbulent, and many are more attached to the margrave than before. The younger margrave... recently reviewed and selected 600 horsemen in the town of Kreilshaim. In Saxony, many seem prepared for war. Maidenburg recently advised its citizens and inhabitants that each should procure provisions sufficient for a whole year. Our people in Augsburg are very fearful, so they retain soldiers, though not openly, yet secretly, with money given weekly in the vicinity.</p>
      <p>Gesner will not regret the work placed in Julius Alexandrinus; I will take care to write to Mr. Julius and... to obtain a privilege in time. It could greatly benefit Gesner, and I do not doubt that a book composed according to the theoretical method will be easily distributed; for many cultivators of more sincere medicine understand more and more daily how vainly they devote themselves to the medical matter and how miserably all consultation in medical matters fluctuates without method.</p>
      <p>We expect no truce between the French and the Emperor; for the King of France is sending a significant sum of money to Italy.</p>
      <p>Some spread amazing things about the tragedy among the Swiss Confederates. I greatly fear that the Five Cantons may be plotting something against the security of good men. The pope will spare no effort to promote these undertakings.</p>
      <p>I will diligently greet Welser in your name. Farewell, my Bullinger, and greet Gesner from the heart. I ask you again to continue to search for a tutor for my son; handle the matter not with random messages, but with hired ones, and do not spare expenses, so that I may know sooner what to hope for. Farewell again, most excellent men and perpetually to be respected by me. In Augsburg, in great haste. January 22, in the year etc. 56.</p>
      <p>G[ereon] S[ailer] d[octor].</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy bishop of Zurich and incomparable friend. Z[Ã¼rich].</p>
