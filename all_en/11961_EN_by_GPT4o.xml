    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Calvin's booklet ["Supplex exhortatio ad invictissimum caesarem Carolum V....", Geneva, Jean Girard, 1543], but has not yet found time to read it; anything that comes from Calvin's pen is always welcome to him. However, he fears that Calvin has made a futile effort [with this writing] towards Emperor Charles V, who is blinded and abuses his power to persecute the divine name; also King Francis [I] of France, about whom many tell bad things, persecutes [the evangelical Christians]; here only prayer helps. The young man recommended by Calvin [...] has been taken in by the city clerk [Werner Beyel] and demands 16 crowns annually for it; also, books and clothes [for the boy] must already be paid for, for which Bullinger has assumed the guarantee; the merchant mentioned by Calvin should write to Bullinger and assure him of the assumption of costs, as Bullinger has often suffered losses in such cases. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I have received, most learned and dearest brother Calvin, the booklet you sent, but due to pressing matters, I have not yet had the opportunity to read anything in it. However, I offer you my eternal thanks for your kindness. Your works are most dear and pleasing to me. For I honor, revere, and embrace you from the heart because of the splendid gifts of God. May the Lord keep you safe for a long time for the glory of His name, so that you may greatly benefit the church through your writings. However, I fear that you have wasted your effort and expense on Charles. For he has turned his ears away from both God Himself and the eternal truth of God. Superstition, falsehood, idolatry, and impiety have besieged his obstinate heart.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on the man. If the Lord grants him any victory, he will misuse it to persecute the name of God. He employs impious, blasphemous, and persecuting leaders of war. And would that King Franz of France had better sense. Would that he persecuted Christ less in the pious. For I fear that both his kingdom and army may someday be oppressed by the just judgment of God. For there are those who report quite atrocious things about him. But I think we must continually pray to the Lord to preserve His church in these most severe tumults of war.</p>
      <p>I have received the young man whom you recommended to me.</p>
      <p>The first city clerk, a distinguished man, has taken him in. He demands 16 crowns annually for it.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, clothes and books must also be paid for. I have pledged my faith. Therefore, my dearest brother, I ask that the merchant you mention in your letters write to me, give his name, and bind his faith. The clerk and good citizens will provide clothes, books, and sustenance. I have pledged my faith to them: therefore, ensure that it does not become a burden to me. And I ask you to take it in good part that I request this. For once and again, I have suffered loss through imprudence in my affairs. Farewell, beloved and most esteemed Calvin. ZÃ¼rich, 16 May in the year 1544. Your brothers Megander, Bibliander, Pellicanus, Gualtherus, Fabritius, etc., greet you.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, D. Johannes Calvin, faithful minister of Christ among the Genevans, Lord and brother to be honored, in Geneva.</p>
