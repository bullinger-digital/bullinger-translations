      <p>Greetings and blessings. I received your letter, honorable lord and dearest brother, dated April 29, quite promptly, and I thank you very much for it. I pray to the Lord to stir the hearts of our people in France to seriously advance the course of the Gospel. Apart from what we receive from you, we have absolutely nothing. Various things are indeed being spread, but almost all by adversaries, which torment us; therefore, we are all delighted whenever your most desired letters reach us. Sulcer in Basel is gradually trying to lead that church away from the true doctrine founded there by Oecolampadius to Lutheranism. And now he has openly joined Martbach and his followers against our churches, and has subscribed to the Augsburg Confession and its Apology, which you know well what it is like in the 10th article. I hear that some beginnings of a new hidden contention are now sprouting among the people of Basel. Yesterday, Michael Angelus from Tübingen came to us, who firmly asserted that Brentius has a new book against me under the press, and it is most slanderous. He brought letters from a certain friend of mine who writes in these words: Brentius's catechism has been translated into the French language by order of the prince and is now being printed by Volmar. A legate will soon be sent to France to deliver those books there, etc. I wanted to indicate this at this time so that you may prepare an antidote there. If only someone would translate the Catechism of the Elector Palatine, recently published, into the French language. The Lutherans hate it worse than a dog and a snake. It is certain that the Württembergian will try everything in France to lead the Zwinglians and Calvinists into the hatred of many, etc. You did very well, my lord and brother, who recently added a letter of admonition for the benefit of the Polish brothers. Tretius was exceedingly pleased. Copies were brought while he was about to leave. D. Ochino joined, who promised him letters to Poland in which he would testify that he is completely alien to those Servetian scoundrels. He spoke frankly and freely with Tretius, even in the presence of others, etc. The most illustrious prince of Hesse sent me the book of Paul Eber on the supper, asking for my judgment on that book. But you have no doubt seen what it is like. He indeed refrains from insults, nor does he quarrel as others do. But he writes openly against us. Nor did he satisfy his Wittenbergers. He gravely offended many everywhere. The Hessian prince was in Stuttgart this month. For his son Ludwig married the daughter of the prince of Württemberg and celebrated the wedding with almost royal luxury, as I hear, not without the offense of many who are almost dying of want. If only that alliance would not bring some evil. In my judgment, Zanchus and Sturmius acted badly and imprudently, who by subscribing to the Augsburg Confession and Apology provided the adversaries with abundant material for triumph. You can hardly believe how much the weak are offended everywhere, how insolently the Lutherans exult and insult the Zwinglians and Calvinists. I pray to the Lord to heal this evil himself. Here in our school, my son-in-law Josias Simler was unanimously received in the place of our blessed martyr, and a very pious and learned colleague, D. Johannes Wolphius, was joined to him, who will indeed persevere in his office (he is, however, a distinguished pastor of a certain church in our city), but will also teach. This will be done in turns, so that it may be easier to satisfy both. Moreover, some burdens have been removed from him so that he can now teach more easily. Pray for us to the Lord that he may bless their labors and preserve our school and church, etc. Never in the memory of man has grain been sold at such a high price as now. A bushel of wheat, which was sold for 2 florins, is now bought for 4. Meanwhile, grain is not to be found. Therefore, there is a remarkable scarcity, hunger, and calamity. May the Lord have mercy on us and turn his wrath away from us. Pray for us. What was done in Basel at the assembly you know better. I have not yet been fully informed by our legate about how the matter stands, etc. I am constrained by miseries on all sides. May the Lord be with us. Farewell excellently in this, dearest brother. We hear that our dearest brother and fellow minister Beza has returned to Geneva. We congratulate him on his happy return, and we pray that you may deign to greet him in our name. The Lord will repay him for those great and most beneficial labors he endured in France. He is rightly loved by us and is held in high esteem. Greet Ionvellaeus and Budeus and the other good men. All the brothers and fellow ministers greet you and pray to the Lord that he may keep you safe for us for a long time.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 21, 1563. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, D. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my honorable lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
