      <p>S. D. To the Alsatian taverns, as I recently warned, the Duke of Württemberg and the four Guise brothers, the Duke, the Prior, Cardinal of Lorraine, and Cardinal of Guise, have gathered. The Duke of Württemberg brought with him Brenz and Johannes Andreae.</p>
      <p>They have been in long discussions with Cardinal of Lorraine, to whom the Augsburg Confession and the Württemberg Confession, previously submitted to the Council of Trent, have been commended. What they concluded is uncertain; however, it is written from Strasbourg to me that one of the brothers, I believe Cardinal of Lorraine, will go directly to the Council of Trent and ensure that an envoy is sent to the German princes. What is sought, then, if not internal discord among the German princes, or that they be granted their confession, and the princes in turn defend or do not oppress the bishops, etc.? It is added in the letters that heavy silver bowls were given as gifts by the cardinal to both; if this is true, it is indeed astonishing that the ministers of Christ accepted a gift from him, who is still stained with the blood of Christ's martyrs.</p>
      <p>But I write these things to you as they have been conveyed to me; however the matter stands, I see great dangers looming over us and that we are being targeted from all sides. But stronger is He who is in us than he who is in the world.</p>
      <p>You have seen what Hesshusius has written against us. I pray, if you have decided to respond, that you respond diligently to the arguments, ignoring that Homeric Thersites character; suggest the same to our dear Beza.</p>
      <p>I expect no less venom from Brenz. You would do me a favor if you wrote to me your judgment on my response, which I hope you have received. I am sending back Beza's letters, as you requested, and I pray that you write to me about what has happened since then; for we hear absolutely nothing, except that Navarre has defected to the Pope.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bring him back! I am also sending the confession of the Polish church, about which I recently also warned. Please ensure that the attached letters are delivered to Christophorus Trecius Polonus, whom I commend to you, and I wish you the best of health. Zurich, March 13, 1562.</p>
      <p>I wrote in great haste because of the departing messenger. The brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Johannes Calvin, faithful minister of the church of Geneva, my esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Geneva.</p>
