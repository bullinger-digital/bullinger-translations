      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ [amen].</p>
      <p>If you wish to know anything about the condition and health of our Erbius, the reverend old man and most holy father, most honorable man of piety, it seemed as if our messenger Hemius had arrived and would not move a step from there until he had witnessed Erbius's struggle and liberation. For the fever had so overwhelmed him that the swelling of the stomach and feet had increased to such an extent that all the upper spiritual members were suffocated, accompanied by other unusual symptoms, namely a continuous hiccup lasting four days, such as none of the summoned doctors had ever seen or heard. Nevertheless, the Father of mercies, in His infinite clemency, has given us and continues to give us good hope for the recovery of his health, for which we implore your faith and effort absolutely to obtain, we all brothers and ministers again and a second time; for we trust that your prayers and those of other faithful ones have not been in vain in the sight of Jesus Christ. Therefore, Erbius also sends his greetings to you and your brothers and fellow students and sends the price for the booklets, and whatever remains from it is assigned to Heinr for his labor; deliver this to him. Furthermore, Furstenlobius wishes to receive the same or even more German treatises, like those already sent, which can be collected into one booklet. I, for my part, ask that you send the little work "On the Origin of Error," which I could conveniently add to this "On Justification"; you will have the price as soon as I know it. It remains for me to add the most abundant greetings from all the brothers to each and every one of you, lords and brothers, which those present themselves wish and command me to do, especially Lord Nikolaus Regulus, who particularly wanted this for you, namely.</p>
      <p>If Erbius had already passed away, certainly Regulus and perhaps another would have been present with you. If he were to be taken away by premature death, they would have returned to you and yours, so that it would be piously considered in time for the prince and the church, lest someone unworthy be imposed on our Betulia.</p>
      <p>Keep this in your deep mind, Father Bullinger, and greet your most delightful family with the most dutiful peace. Hastily in Riquewihr on the Nones of April 1554.</p>
      <p>Little student of the Church of Christ, Johannes Ulstetter. To the most esteemed professor of the most holy Christian religion, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Doctor of Zürich, his most revered lord. Zürich.</p>
