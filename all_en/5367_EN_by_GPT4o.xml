      <p>S. D. I received your most desired letter, honorable lord, most esteemed lord, and dearest brother, through the distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Budaeus, our dearest brother.</p>
      <p>I am deeply grieved by the innocent blood of the saints being shed in such abundance in France, and I pray to the Lord to have mercy on His church and pour out His wrath on those who do not call upon His name. I rejoice again that our people are being helped by the Lord in some places, whom I continually ask to deliver us from evil with just aid and to scatter and crush the forces of our enemies, if He does not wish to have mercy on them and convert them.</p>
      <p>Regarding the matters you have instructed, I have discussed each one in detail with Mr. Budaeus, who will report back.</p>
      <p>Briefly: I will do what I can with utmost faith and diligence. Today, I carefully arranged for the letters addressed to Hercules von Salice to be sent to the court of the Rhaetians. Do not neglect the Rhaetians; if necessary, they can provide experienced and benevolent soldiers; but it must be done in time, and before the affairs of our people are desperate and scattered, we must act with them. Once fortune begins to decline, the spirits of those who were previously eager in not yet unfortunate circumstances also weaken.</p>
      <p>I also wrote diligently today to Hallwyler; and I wrote about the same matter to Mr. Nikolaus Diesbach in Bern through Budaeus, urging him to press Hallwyler; he is related to him by marriage. I ask Hallwyler to write to you in full about the matter if he can do anything.</p>
      <p>Today, I arranged for the letters of Cond√© and the admiral to be delivered to Baden for the Swiss Diet. I have urged our envoys to prevent, as much as they can, the departure.</p>
      <p>They have prevented it so far; but now it is said that they have unfurled their banners everywhere and will depart tomorrow, which I pray to the Lord will turn out very badly for them.</p>
      <p>Be vigilant, be vigilant about Lyon; it is the primary concern. They desire to recover Lyon; there are many and varied plans regarding this.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I did not gladly read that the baron, the prefect of Lyon, has gone to Valence; I also recently wrote to you about this matter. Be vigilant; they have already devoured Lyon in hope.</p>
      <p>May the Lord protect and preserve Lyon! Let us pray without ceasing to the Lord to save us; for many and great dangers are imminent. Let us, however, be strong in the Lord.</p>
      <p>In this, farewell together with all the brothers and fellow ministers; all of ours greet you, especially you. If you ever write to Beza, greet him in the name of all of us.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless him and deliver him from evil! Farewell again and again. June 19, 1562.</p>
      <p>The rest is from Budaeus.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>He will speak about the letters of Johann Friedrich of Saxony sent to the council of this city. To the distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
