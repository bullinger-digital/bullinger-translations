    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] It is quite obvious that Christ has withdrawn his support from the Protestants and has made the Germans and Swiss anxious, so that they do not stand up decisively and dutifully for their homeland. 15,000 Spaniards and Italians are ravaging and occupying the Upper German cities unhindered, whose authorities even forbid any resistance under threat of severe punishment! It is inconceivable!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Meanwhile, the godless enemies enrich themselves and plunge the Germans into misery. Swiss mercenaries, who were crushed by the Spaniards, wander around as despised beggars. The remaining Swiss sit idly at home and expect the same fate as the Swabians, as if they would rather perish alone than triumph with the others! Emperor Charles V is therefore amassing the gold and silver of the Germans to recruit new soldiers everywhere, even from the Protestant camp (many Württembergers have already defected to him because the people of Strasbourg are no longer enlisting). With these troops, he will defeat the Protestants!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Since the latter do not want to consider this in their deliberations, it must be assumed that God wants to punish them. Happy are those who understand God's plans and patiently entrust themselves to His will, even if it physically pains them to witness all this, especially because they know exactly that success would have been achieved if only they had wanted to resist! But let the Lord's will be done. May He grant steadfastness in faith!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger is certainly better informed about the people of Ulm, Frankfurt, and Württemberg than Myconius. Furthermore, Francisco de Enzinas will report on this during his visit to Zurich. Allegedly, the people of Ulm now want to make amends for their outrageous behavior. Can Bullinger provide more details about this? Maximilian of Egmont, Count of Buren, is said to have even rebuked the cunning people of Frankfurt, unworthy of the Christian name! Duke Ulrich of Württemberg has forbidden any resistance against the advancing enemies, allegedly to protect the population from arson. This displeases his son, Duke Christoph of Württemberg, who is currently staying in Basel. The articles of the peace agreement with the Emperor are not yet known; however, the Duke already has a bad reputation. A scholar from his court reported that about 30,000 men in Württemberg would have been ready to fight against the Spanish and Italian scum. But the Duke did not want it. Perhaps his age is to blame, but certainly also his recklessness. Another member of the court confirmed that the Duke would still be financially and militarily capable of waging war with the Emperor for about three months. Instead, he seeks peace out of fear where none is to be found. The consequences of this will be felt clearly if God does not intervene!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] From the army of Elector John Frederick of Saxony, a man shares good news with a nobleman staying in Basel: Dresden, the residence of Duke Maurice of Saxony, has been taken, and 70 cannons on wagons, 200,000 thalers, and as much gold could be confiscated there. This was also written to Duke Christoph. His wife, Duchess Anna Maria (born of Brandenburg-Ansbach), gave birth to a child (Hedwig of Württemberg) in Basel. Count George of Württemberg-Mömpelgard is also in Basel.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] For several days, there have been rumors that the Danish King Christian III has died, Landgrave Philip of Hesse has been elected in his place, and the Hanseatic cities are getting along excellently with him. In Strasbourg, there is no news from the Elector or the Landgrave. The roads are blocked because Frankfurt has surrendered, and the bishops of Bamberg (Weigand of Redwitz), Eichstätt (Moritz of Hutten), and Würzburg (Melchior Zobel), together with Margrave Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, are mustering new troops against John Ernest of Saxony-Coburg, the brother of the Elector.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] A citizen born in Basel from Lübeck believes that at the beginning of spring, 100,000 men from Denmark and the Hanseatic cities will join the Protestants. He wanted to bet 100 crowns with some priests from Freiburg (i.Br.) that the Emperor would be driven out of Germany by summer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] In a letter from King Francis I of France, there is talk of 10,000 men from Gascony, 15,000 Italians under Piero Strozzi, as well as 15,000 men from France along with cavalry. In addition, the King demands 12,000 to 15,000 Swiss to march against the Emperor.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Myconius gave Johannes Gast the money for the wool and informed Bullinger of this in a letter dated January 7, which was never sent (the messenger disappeared without a trace).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Enzinas will leave Basel next Monday to visit Bullinger. Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. Indeed, I believe that the Lord Jesus has temporarily withdrawn his friendship from us, as nothing happens today that shows his favor and goodwill! He has taken away the courage of both the Germans and the Swiss. We lack counsel and strength, and even patriotism. Fifteen thousand Spaniards and Italians are ravaging Upper Germany and occupying cities without resistance, indeed with the authorities forbidding anyone to resist under severe penalty. Who would believe this unless it were before their eyes?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Meanwhile, they are amassing enormous treasures, with which the most godless enemies enrich themselves, and the Germans are impoverished. The Swiss, well beaten and wounded by the Spaniards, beg and are contemptuously disregarded. The rest sit idly at home without good counsel, apparently awaiting the fate that also oppressed the Swabians, as if they would rather perish alone than conquer with others. How much gold and silver has the Emperor already gathered from the Germans, and for what, if not to gather new soldiers from everywhere, even from us (for many from Württemberg have gone to him today, after finding neither hope nor money among the people of Strasbourg), and finally to conquer us. That is indeed his plan!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>While many know these things, they are ignored in consultations, and I can think of nothing else but that the Lord has also decided something about correcting us. Blessed are those who, while knowing the Lord's will here, do not hesitate to submit to it patiently! Yet it is dreadful in the meantime to have those evils almost in sight, especially when they persuade themselves that they could be met with a good outcome if only our people were willing. But let what seems good in the eyes of the Lord be done, only may He kindly look upon us in the meantime and grant us steadfastness in His faith.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>You know better the news about the people of Ulm, Frankfurt, and Württemberg. Francisco de Enzinas will also tell about them. The people of Ulm have acted very impiously against God and men, although there are rumors that they are now correcting themselves. I would like to understand something about this from you. The people of Frankfurt are entirely treacherous and unworthy to be called Christians or men. They say that for these reasons they have been severely rebuked by the Count of Buren, which is surprising. The Duke of Württemberg has forbidden his people to resist the approaching enemies, under the pretense that this would more easily prevent arson. His son, who is with us now, is very displeased with his father for this reason, and we still do not know all the articles of the peace. The Duke is ill-spoken of among all good men. A good and learned man from the court told me that there are still about 30,000 men in Württemberg who would have been willing and able to fight against the Spanish and Italian scum with praise, but he did not want it, perhaps out of that senile fear, which often lacks prudence. Another person from the same family told me that the Duke could have waged war with the Emperor for up to three months with his own resources and men, and still could, but fear has so occupied the man that he sought peace where there is no peace; the following time will abundantly prove this unless the Lord prevents the wicked men.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>From the Saxon army, someone writes to a certain nobleman who is with us that everything is going well and among other things that Dresden, the seat of Maurice, has been captured, along with 70 cannons on wagons, 200,000 thalers, and as much gold. The same good news was written to the younger Duke of Württemberg, whose wife is with us in childbirth. Count George is also present.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>For several days, the rumor has been consistently flying that the Danish King has died, and that Hesse has been elected King of Denmark, and that the maritime cities are getting along excellently with him. The people of Strasbourg know nothing about the Elector or Hesse, as the roads are closed due to the surrender of Frankfurt and because the bishops of Bamberg, Eichstätt, and Würzburg, along with Margrave Albert, are gathering a new army against John Ernest, the half-brother of the Elector.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>A citizen of Lübeck, born in Basel, a man of stature plainly Swiss, promises at the beginning of spring a hundred thousand Danes and from the maritime cities. He wanted to bet a hundred crowns with the priests here in Freiburg if the Emperor would not be driven out of Germany this summer.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The letters sent by the King state: 10,000 Gascons, 15,000 Italians led by Strozzi, 15,000 from central France along with cavalry. To these, he requests 12,000 or 15,000 from the Swiss.</p>

      <p>I myself gave money to Gast, which I also wrote on January 7 (I did not send it because the messenger had flown away).</p>

      <p>Dryander will leave here directly to you next Monday. Farewell in Christ. Basel, January 20, 1547. Yours, Os. Myc.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious in the Lord, Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
