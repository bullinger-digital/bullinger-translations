      <p>God and all good things.</p>
      <p>Friendly, dear lord and brother, at this moment Lienhart Schnider from Augsburg arrives with letters, among which is also a letter from our dear lord Hoser to me and you. I hereby send you one letter addressed to me; I do not know if you also have German copies or not; you will know what to do. I write in the utmost haste; for at this moment I also have much else to write to Geneva. I am not informed of any other news from Augsburg, except that our princes do not want to attend the council, and what decision was made regarding the papal legate; we already knew all that beforehand. My brother-in-law Peter Schär wrote to me the day before yesterday that the emperor is greatly concerned about the Turks; for once again two great Hungarian lords have defected to him, and he is said to be in great preparation for war. Also, that in Neuburg in Saxony the other princes did not want to sign with the young Duke Hans Friedrich, but have sided with the Hessian and the Count Palatine, so that our people should not be condemned in such a manner; we have heard this before, but not quite certainly. He also writes to me that on April 2nd the Duke of Württemberg summoned all his provisions to Stuttgart on horseback because of Elecurt; it is said that those from Ortenburg have taken it, and there is concern that it means nothing good, and that the child has another father; for Württemberg had held this Elecurt. In summary: everything is tending towards unrest.</p>
      <p>Yesterday I heard from credible people that in the lands in several places, especially in Unterwalden, there is great agitation and the women are more vehement than the men, and there is a woman there, a relative of Brother Clausen, also a very spiritual person; she claims that her God revealed to her in a vision that if the Glarus people are not seriously punished, he will punish them. Thus, the bloodthirsty devil must and shall blind the world.</p>
      <p>Well, if we now faithfully held to God, I would have no discouragement, but this reckless behavior of our people causes all the pious to worry greatly, the measure is full. Oh, may the Lord count us among his own, let it go as it may; it is a bad time to act, we have overcome it. Let me know if you have seen Schwenckfeld's little book, which he has just published, titled "Quęstiones aliquot Casparis Schwenckfeldii de ecclesia christiana." The man still hopes with force that everyone who wants to be a Christian must become of his opinion. I can say no more.</p>
      <p>Dated April 10th, at the first hour of the afternoon. Commend us diligently to the Lord.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius Blaurer, yours in the Lord. To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable and most beloved brother.</p>
