      <p>S. P. I received your letter, which you wrote to me, venerable father and teacher in Christ, and I would have responded long ago if I had not been waiting for the end of this tragedy; for I preferred to announce joyful rather than sad news. But since I see that it has neither head nor tail, I am compelled at last (though late) to respond and to reveal and indicate the whole matter or at least the essence of it. First, this whole tragedy of ours revolves around the doctrine of the Holy Supper, which was secretly agitated between me and the German preachers three years ago, but recently, a few months ago, it was exacerbated, inflamed, and made public by some good men (if it pleases the gods) from our church, who, driven by some spirit of envy, when they could not attack me in another matter, accused me first before the German preachers, then before our magistrate as a Zwinglian, and that I taught differently about the Lord's Supper than they did and concluded that all who taught differently about the sacraments than I did were heretics, and that I openly and publicly in the pulpit approved the doctrine of the Zurichers by teaching that I completely agreed with them while condemning the doctrine of our preachers. The argument was increased by the fact that all your young men, who are here studying, including your son, communicated with me in the Holy Supper, although they did not understand my language. These and other such things those holy men accused me of. This matter was long debated in the assembly of preachers and finally devolved to the magistrate, where it is still being debated today. The magistrate, however, shortly after sent some of the senators to our church together with Lord Doctor Barbachius, the first preacher of this city, who gave a Latin sermon, which I immediately interpreted into French. There he dealt with many things about the sacraments, and that purely and quite holily; in the end, he finally added that he did not know the manner of Christ's presence in the sacrament, that it exceeded the capacity of our mind; therefore he was not anxious about how it is present or how it is received, he was content with that word of Christ: This is my body, and to say with Mary: Let it be to me according to your word. I, however, immediately added that I clearly knew that manner and that it was spiritual and received through true faith, so that it is food for the inner man, just as bread and wine are for the outer man; for this is the nature of the sacraments.</p>
      <p>Then they offered me the Augsburg Confession, so that I might teach according to it. I, however, replied that I could and would accept it in a good sense, that is, provided it is well understood. Now, however, my adversaries, not content with this my response, urge that I accept that confession according to the exposition and interpretation of the Saxon churches, B..., Wittenberg[ensian] and this of Strasbourg. I respond that that confession is not of greater nor equal authority with me than the word of God itself; that if the interpretation of the word is simply left free to me without being compelled to the interpretation of this or that man or church, a fortiori the exposition of this confession should be left free to me, for the spirit of God is not to be bound, nor did Luther himself wish to bind to the judgment of this or that. But when these my tormentors saw that I was firm and could not be broken, they called another French preacher from Vesalia, whose name is Peter Alexander, a doctor of the Sorbonne, whom they thought to be a Lutheran, as he had been before. But when he approved my doctrine (as it was reported to me), he was finally sent back to his own in Vesalia. This is the sum of all that has been done here among us so far, and this is the crux of my situation today. What will happen, the Lord knows, by whose providence all things are governed, to whom I also commit all things.</p>
      <p>Moreover, in this matter, it happened to me what happened to my Lord Christ on the cross, who was persecuted by those by whom he should have been defended, and denied by those who should have confessed him, and those who knew him were more silent than fish. For this unfortunate dispute about the sacraments today in Germany is almost as odious as the dispute about the gospel in the papacy. May the Lord God grant better things by his mercy. As for me, I know what and whom I have believed; I will keep faith with him and will not be moved a hair's breadth, with God's favor, as long as I live.</p>
      <p>I have often discussed these matters with our brother and faithful friend, Mr. John Burker, the Englishman, who also communicated your letters and your advice to me. But with things standing as they are now, I do not judge it good for the lords of the Swiss to write anything back here to our lords. For I fear that minds, already too much exacerbated, would be broken rather than softened, or perhaps I myself would be judged a disturber of churches and the republic.</p>
      <p>I will commit the whole matter and the outcome of the matter to the Lord, whose cause is being conducted rather than mine, who is also the protector and patron of innocence. This only we ask of you, that you remember us in your holy prayers and always consider me as a fellow member and brother, who I am and wish to be a member of your holy church, whose doctrine, faith, and religion I have always approved and embraced (since my conversion) and have retained, taught, teach, and will teach, as long as I live, with God's favor, even if I had to be exiled or rather die, because the doctrine is of truth, not yours, but of Jesus. For I do not preach the Zurichers (as I am accused), but Christ, nor the doctrine of the Zurichers, but of Christ, the apostles, and the prophets, which alone I recognize as true, and I announce and teach, nor am I of Cephas, Paul, Apollos, or any other, but of Jesus alone, who alone became man for me, died and rose again and lives forever.</p>
      <p>May God grant that we live to him forever. Amen. Who will separate us from our Christ Jesus, neither death nor life nor... But that you have remembered me and have deigned to honor me, so obscure a disciple, with your most distinguished letters, I have a gratitude that will never perish, and if in any matter you can use my service or I can gratify you, I will do it from the heart. Lord Valerand, minister of the French church, which is in Frankfurt, gave me these letters of Lord Hooper and asks that, having read them, I send them to you, so that you may understand the state and constancy of the man and his companions and commend him diligently to the holy prayers of the church. Your son and all your young men who are here are giving excellent attention to their studies, as far as I can see, and they always communicate with us in the Holy Supper and will communicate, God willing, even if the devil is unwilling. For I have an open church, which I cannot close except to men of bad faith, life, or doctrine. If it happens that I go up to Geneva (for I wish to visit all those churches once), passing through I will also visit you, if the Lord wills; for I greatly desire to see you and the order of your church, so that I may receive some spiritual gift from you for the use of our French church, to which I wish all the best. I wish to greet all the fathers and my lords, the doctors of your church, Mr. Conrad Pellican, whose letters I recently received and showed to Lord de S sellis, a noble Frenchman; I do not write to him now, as time does not permit at this fair time, Lord Bibliander, Mr. Gwalter, and the like, to all of whom I wish an increase of grace and gifts, glory, and eternal happiness. Farewell, therefore, all of you, perpetually happy. May the Lord God keep you safe for a long time for his church to the glory of his most holy name and to the edification of us all through his Son, our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>See, most excellent father and teacher, see, I say, how tumultuously and familiarly I write as to a beloved father, who can easily forgive the errors of his son; therefore, I beg you, pardon my style and pen. Strasbourg, hastily, July 6, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted John Garnier. To the most illustrious man and distinguished doctor of the Christian church, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his teacher and superior in the Lord, these are given.</p>
