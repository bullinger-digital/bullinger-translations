      <p>Greetings. I cannot, most distinguished man and dearest godfather, express even the smallest thanks for the benefits you have always bestowed upon me, especially in this my necessity, which now presses upon me greatly. I wish that I may receive as soon as possible this barrel filled with grain, about which you write to me.</p>
      <p>I see that I am not entirely abandoned by our most noble and esteemed leaders and fathers. I will pray to the Lord that I may never fall from their memory and that I may conduct myself in such a way that they do not seem to have bestowed their benefits upon an ungrateful person. I wrote not long ago to Mr. Johannes Wellenberg, the prefect in Rheinau, so that he too, when it is permitted with the abbot's consent, may deign to hasten and accelerate the division of the parish stipend in Marthalen; for I know that Mr. Johannes Heinrich Locher also greatly desires this. If this is done, then, as I wrote before, I will return as much grain as I received to the officials' treasury. On the tenth day of February, the Lord called from this life the dearest and most pious man, Mr. Kaspar Tschudi, who once served as steward of our church and stood as a foundation and pillar. All of us here mourn him deeply, for with his authority, with which he was divinely endowed, he once led the state of our entire church and republic, which was somewhat unfavorable, like a vigorous and tireless helmsman guiding a ship into a calm bay and harbor. He stood that day in the market to receive meat, and, struck by apoplexy, he departed in sudden death. May the best and greatest God, in His kindness and mercy, provide another and many like him, who also desire to promote the glory of Christ and the salvation of the whole church. The rest, which I wish to share with you, I will reserve until such time as I am permitted to speak with you in person; may God grant that this happens soon.</p>
      <p>Mr. Avienus, Beldius, Thomas Fabricius, the treasurer, Mr. Pfendler, and the others wish you well along with all the ministers of the word.</p>
      <p>Hastily from Glarus, February 14, 1571. Your most loving godson, Johannes Hug from Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and distinguished man and lord, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful leader of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his honorable and beloved lord and godfather.</p>
