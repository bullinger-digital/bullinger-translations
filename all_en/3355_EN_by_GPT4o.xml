      <p>Greetings. What we most desired according to God and His pure knowledge, most distinguished man, was that those teachers, by whom the light of the Gospel illuminates our minds, would regard us as sons and be to each of us as dear parents. This has been abundantly granted to us by God, the best and greatest.</p>
      <p>For here, after your, or rather our, Calvin received us into his faith, gathered from the whole world, he has not ceased, since he begot us in Christ, to nourish and strengthen us liberally, generously, and sacredly with his pious and learned writings and sacred sermons from the pulpit.</p>
      <p>In this matter, as in others, although he fully satisfies everyone else, he does not satisfy himself. Nor would he think he had fulfilled the duty of a father with such great, ardent, and perpetual zeal in increasing and adorning us, unless he also ensured by his own virtue that there would be a competitive gathering of the holiest pastors to love and assist the church, which I do not say he presides over but serves. For you know well that this family is loved without rival because of that pillar.</p>
      <p>And just as it is very pleasing to us to reap the immortal fruit of your love for our parent, so nothing can be taken away from his right. For from the adornments of children, among which are the friendships of outstanding men, a considerable addition is usually made to the praise of parents. So we rightly do not doubt that, while you wanted your most serious studies on the Apocalypse of John to appear in our name, your plan was not only to incite and inform this flock to piety but also to further adorn its pastor more and more from here.</p>
      <p>Therefore, for both reasons, we owe you everything, as you continue to be the same in choosing our teacher as you always have been, and you wish to have that love for his disciples, even dedicating your learned vigils to posterity, as long as this sun will be seen, to be testified. Who would not love you for such a rare gift? Who could give thanks worthy of it? Who would not embrace, cultivate, and observe such sweet manners and such a learned and holy old age? You make it so that today we enjoy the authority of your living testimony, judgment, benevolence, and the sweetness of your intellect and such learned offspring. If noble and generous men pay off another's debt, while they profess to owe more to him to whom they owe much, it will also be easy for us to pay off in that way, but only that way. For from that book of yours, in which you deigned to address us, we attribute to you the greatest honor: but from the constant reading of it, which we meditate on, we hope that not only the fruits of dignity but also of learned piety will be abundantly owed to you by us, and in the meantime, we proclaim it.</p>
      <p>Nor will it ever happen that the memory of this benefit will be buried in us by oblivion. Now truly, since we are entirely Calvin's, whatever we are, and all things of friends are common, we easily obtained from him through his kindness, that he, asserting us by use, would yield to you by right of possession, by which you will always have us as yours. May God, the common Father of the faithful in Christ Jesus, keep you, a man most esteemed by us, safe for His honor to be increased and the church to be promoted. Geneva, on the Nones of October.</p>
      <p>You recognize this church from foreigners as obedient to your commands. Ministers of the Genevan church in the name of all the exiled French.</p>
      <p>The elders and deacons of the Italian church in the name of the whole church. Ministers, elders, and deacons of the whole Anglican church subscribe in the name.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the ZÃ¼rich church.</p>
