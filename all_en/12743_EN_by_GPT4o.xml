    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] [From a report written shortly after November 4 by an unknown person:] "The Bohemians captured the places Gottesgab and Platten near [Saint] Joachimsthal on October 23.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] On Saturday, October 30, around noon, Albrecht [Count of] Schlick, as the leader, attacked and burned the villages Landwüst and Siebenbrunn, located a quarter mile from our place of stay near Markneukirchen, with hussars and a cavalry squadron from the Bohemian camp. He then moved on to Adorf, which surrendered. While in other villages three to four farmsteads were burned down, in Adorf only two barns were burned. However, everything within a mile was plundered and destroyed. The people of the Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony] did not expect the attack and therefore hid nothing, so horses, cattle, money, and much else were taken from churches and houses. In the evening, about 400 cows were driven by the attackers to Schönbach [near Asch] to be driven to the camp located one and a half miles from us near [the] Eger the next morning.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] On Monday, November 1, the Bohemian army advanced again on Adorf, which had been recaptured the previous evening [by the electoral Saxon troops] under Wolf von Gräfendorf, the captain of Plauen, with 300 horsemen and 6 companies. When the Bohemians realized that Gräfendorf had taken a position on a hill near Adorf, they formed three groups from their 200 hussars and a cavalry squadron and attacked the elector's forces from three sides, causing them to flee. 300 to 400 men of their garrison were killed; we saw the naked corpses lying at the battle site the next day when the captain [...] of Königsberg [on the Eger], who leads his own cavalry squadron alongside the hussars, rode with me to Count Schlick (with whom he had already fought together). Fewer than 10 men were killed among the Bohemians and hussars; among the elector's riders, two captains, namely Hans Wilhelm von Weißenbach from Helmsgrün and a nobleman named Adam Weder, ensign of the cavalry squadron. We could not learn or recognize in the haste who else had perished, as all the dead lay around unclothed. Most of the victims were hit from behind on the neck or head while fleeing. On our way, we often had to ride over the dead; the Bohemians even drive their wagons over the corpses lying on the road. Several electoral Saxon riders fled to Plauen, two miles from Adorf. There stood 12,000 combat-ready electoral mercenaries, who were all driven to flight by the fleeing riders, even leaving behind their artillery, spears, and armor! On November 4, the fleeing troop dissolved.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Oelsnitz surrendered on November 2. Four citizens approached Count Schlick on the battlefield with white staffs [as a sign of capitulation] and a [capitulation] letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] On the same day, Duke Maurice [of Saxony] advanced with his army before Zwickau. He stands on the side of the king [Ferdinand I], although his people are very unwilling to go to war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Sebastian von Weitmühl is the supreme commander [of the Bohemians]. On behalf of the king, he declared war on the elector. The Bohemian chancellor [and burgrave of Meissen, Heinrich IV.] of Plauen and many Bohemian nobles were also present at the declaration of war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] There are over 2,200 hussars and Turks and 2,500 other riders in the field, totaling over 4,000 cavalrymen and 12,000 foot soldiers. More soldiers are joining daily.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] On November 4, [the Bohemian troop leader] Wolf Christoph von Liechtenstein was stationed with 130 riders before Schönbach [near Asch]. Right now, 40 riders from Austria and Moravia are passing through. More troops are expected.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] In Eger, two monasteries have been cleared for the king, who wants to set up his winter quarters there to be better informed about the events.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] The Bohemians had 700 wagons in the camp near Landwüst, more than 60 of which were loaded with gunpowder and many with war materials. Artillery also arrived from Vienna, including eight large wall breakers, each drawn by 26 to 28 horses, and several field guns, each drawn by 12 to 14 horses. The convoy had a total length of one and a half miles. The convoy master [...] reported that the weekly expenses for the artillery alone amounted to 18,000 florins.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Today, the city of Eger provided 200 soldiers. The nobility of the region also supplies troops; however, I do not know how many foot soldiers and cavalrymen. Furthermore, a lot of provisions are being sent to the camp.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Several report that Hesse and the Hanseatic cities are sending many soldiers to the elector."</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] [Blarer's letter:] It was reported from Augsburg that in the entire Danube valley between the water "Müssel" and the Schmuttertal, barely a mile from Augsburg, all villages belonging to the city were plundered and destroyed. Women and children fled to the city with over 1,000 wagons, on which they had loaded the few belongings they had saved. The peasants were stabbed, the wealthy captured and taken away: an indescribably miserable situation! In Augsburg, however, there are no more than 200 cavalrymen, and due to the wet weather, the foot soldiers could do nothing against the numerous enemy riders roaming around between the 7th and about the 15th of November. May God have mercy on the poor people!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Emperor [Charles V] acts in a peculiar way, for in all the cities he has taken, such as Donauwörth, Lauingen, Leipheim, and many others, he has spared the inhabitants and allowed the continuation of the evangelical preaching. He has appointed loyal men to administer these cities so that the bad war rabble may not harm the inhabitants. For whatever reason the emperor acts this way, God is to be praised for it! In the countryside and villages, however, things have gone terribly.</p>

      <p>"On October 23, the Bohemians captured Gottesgab and Platten, located near Johannstal. On October 30 (Saturday), the Bohemians made their first attack on us a quarter mile away. Lord Albrecht Schlick led the hussars and a squadron of cavalry out of the Bohemian camp, and around noon (that was on Saturday), they attacked the first village (called Laidwytz, more in the hour a market town Newkirchen) and a village called Siebenbrunn. The hussars plundered and burned everything and then moved towards the small town called Adorf. It surrendered. And now there are only two barns burned there (while in other villages 3 or 4 farmsteads were burned), but within a mile everything was plundered and destroyed, as the Elector's people did not expect the enemy to come so close. They hid nothing, so horses, cattle, money, and other things were found in the churches and houses. That night, the hussars and riders brought about 400 cows to Schienbach. They intended to drive them to the camp, 1 1/2 miles from us, near Eger, the next morning, etc.</p>

      <p>On Monday, the first day of November, the Bohemian camp moved before Adorf. It had been recaptured during the night. Reason: the captain of Plauen, named Wolf Gravendorffer, had come up with 300 horsemen and 6 companies of land troops. He held a position on a hill near Adorf, 2 fields away. When the Bohemians became aware, they formed three groups with the 200 hussars and a squadron of cavalry and attacked the Elector's forces at three places. They fled. 300 to 400 of the Elector's men were killed, whom we saw the next day on the battlefield. They were all stripped naked. The captain of Königsberg rode with me to Lord Albrecht Schlick. He led a squadron of cavalry alongside the hussars. He was also involved in the skirmish. Fewer than 10 Bohemians and hussars were killed; among the Elector's riders, two captains named Hans Wilhelm von Wissenbach from Helmersgrim and the cavalry ensign, also a nobleman named Adam Weder, etc., remained dead. We could not learn more notable names in the haste, as all the dead were stripped naked, so we could not recognize them. Most were struck from behind on the neck and head while fleeing. We had to ride over them in several places on the way. If one lay in the wagon track, the Bohemians drove their wagons right over them! In the flight, several riders came to Plauen (which is two miles away). There were 12,000 Elector's mercenaries in battle order. They fled as soon as the riders said they should flee, leaving behind artillery, spears, and weapons. On the 4th, due to the flight, everything was scattered.</p>

      <p>The Bohemians had over 700 wagons in the camp near Landwytz. We counted more than 60 wagons of gunpowder. Artillery from Vienna also arrived, including 8 large wall breakers, each drawn by 26 or 28 horses, and a field gun, a good number (I have not seen or could note everything), each drawn by 12 or 14 horses, and many wagons with various war equipment. It stretched for 1 1/2 miles. The convoy master told me he needs 18,000 florins weekly for the artillery alone.</p>

      <p>On this date, Eger also sent 200 men; likewise, the nobility around here. I do not yet know how many were sent on horseback and on foot; but a lot of provisions are going to the camp.</p>

      <p>Otherwise, I am informed from Augsburg that the entire Danube valley from the water Müssel to the Schmuttertal (now only a small mile from Augsburg), all villages have been plundered, destroyed, and robbed (what the citizen of Augsburg), everything completely torn apart and devastated. Over a thousand wagons, women and children with small household items (as they could bring them), fled to the city of Augsburg, the peasants were stabbed, the rich captured and taken away, which cannot be written enough about the misery. In Augsburg, they had no more than 200 horses in the city. The foot soldiers could not achieve anything against the raiding enemies during this weather from November 7 and eight days thereafter, as it was wet. God have mercy and be the father of the poor people!</p>

      <p>The emperor acts otherwise wonderfully. In all the small towns, Thainowwerd, Laugingen, Lupheim, and many others he has taken, he has harmed no one, but protected them well. They still have their evangelical preaching and are everywhere as before. He has appointed people over them to keep them from being wantonly harmed by the rabble. God has granted these small towns so much good. Whatever reason the emperor acts this way, God is to be praised with all gratitude. But in the countryside and villages, things have gone terribly!</p>
