    <p xml:id="regest1">Is healthy, apart from eye troubles. Regrets that Bullinger received his letter [No. 1206] so late, and asks again for feedback on his travel plans; Otto [Werdm√ºller] is available for the delivery of the letter. Agrees with the advice for a modest diet, but would prefer not to change the host for the remaining time, as the savings would be minimal. Will take care of the letter for Nicholas [Partridge]. Cannot report any news; he could not find the much-praised tragedy "Pammachius" [by Thomas Naogeorg], which appeared in Wittenberg. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Know, most respected father, that my health is intact, except that my eyes are not as sharp as the rest of my body; for some reason, they are weakening day by day and often cause me pain.</p>
      <p>But God will also put an end to this. I am very sorry that my letters reached you so late; if they had been delivered to you earlier, they would have greatly benefited both my affairs and those of my companion, if we had received a definite response from you about our new journey. However, I hope you will ensure that I receive it from you as soon as possible. If you lack a messenger to go to Strasbourg, our Otto can send the letters to me in Basel almost every day.</p>
      <p>You wrote to me about the plan for my life in your last letters, which would indeed be a very useful plan if I could find such a host anywhere.</p>
      <p>For I understand that you think my expenses are higher because of the more splendid meals served to us, which is not really the case. Since I dare not hide anything from you, whom I consider the only one to be honored as a father, know for certain that as long as I have lived, I have never been served at a more frugal table, so that I often wish to exchange all the delights of our table for Swiss frugality. For we must drink in moderation, with only one small cup served to each person, filled only once, which I would not mind if I could bear the water of this place. The food we are served is very luxurious, vegetables and turnips. However, I could not find anyone who would feed me in the same way for a price lower than 26 florins. I think it would be inappropriate to change hosts for the sake of one florin, especially since I will soon have to leave. I hope my affairs will be better in the spring. I ask you to support me with your advice, which I now expect daily, after carefully considering my plan (which I explained to you before).</p>
      <p>I will make sure to write to our Nicholas in England as soon as I can.</p>
      <p>There are various rumors among us, but nothing certain is known. A certain tragedy called "Pammachius" was recently published in Wittenberg; everyone praises it highly, and I would have sent it to you if I could have found it for sale. I cannot write more now, nor do I have anything whose report I understand would benefit you. Accept these things of mine with your usual equanimity.</p>
      <p>Give my regards to your mother, your wife, and your entire family, to whom I wish a most fortunate year. January 4, 1539.</p>
      <p>Rod. Gwalther, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed patron. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
