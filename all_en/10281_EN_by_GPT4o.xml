      <p>Greetings. Although I recently, most learned Heinrich, explained the reasons for my life to you in a very long letter, I thought it would not be out of place to remind you once again about the same matter. I do not think it is necessary to go over the matter in detail again. That has been done quite sufficiently before. Now, wishing to somewhat serve your occupations, which do not always allow you to remember all calamities accurately, I have decided to refresh your memory of me with this letter. Nor would I have done this if the governor of our province, Johannes Edlibach, had not been the author of this plan, who said he would set out for Zurich the day after tomorrow. He will intercede on my behalf before the council courteously and kindly. For this matter, he might perhaps use your auxiliary help. Therefore, I beseech and implore you through Christ, not to fail me as a friend to a friend. But lest I seem to importunately ask for your help, as if I were someone who is accustomed to demand services from friends at inconvenient times, I wish to be cleared of this by these letters. However, when both the occasion of the times and your occupations allow, then at last accommodate yourself to me for a little while. Indeed, if it is possible through my modest means, I will gladly do the same for you.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Written hastily in Frauenfeld, without revision, on the 9th day of August.</p>
      <p>Michael Schlatter, yours as his own.</p>
      <p>To the honorable Heinrich Bullinger, public professor of sacred theology in Zurich, his esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
