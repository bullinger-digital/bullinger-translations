      <p>Greetings. The person delivering this letter to you came to us from Wittenberg and, as he was considering traveling to Zürich, he earnestly requested me to equip him with my recommendation and letters so that he might approach you and your colleagues. Therefore, I have rendered him this service and trust that you will not take it amiss if I prepare his way to you with my letters. Therefore, I earnestly beseech you to assist him with your advice and support; I, in turn, will always be ready to render any service I can for the benefit of you and yours. Besides this, I have nothing to write except that our barbaric and ignorant beast is now losing all its authority day by day, because its tyrannical and cunning arts have been exposed, and it can no longer harm good men as it has harmed many before; indeed, our school has begun to fare better since the magistrate took away the office of dean from him and that Saturnine man initiated action against us. But you will learn more about these matters from me or others at another time. Make sure he feels that I have written about him.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Mr. Sturmius sends his greetings to you, and he is considering marrying another wife. October 7, 1572, in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>Yours, Konrad Dasypodius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and greatly esteemed friend.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
