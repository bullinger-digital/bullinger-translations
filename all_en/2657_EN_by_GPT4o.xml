      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, most illustrious Bullinger, proven to the pious by the name of doctrine and integrity, Bernardino Ochino comes to you. Although it was not necessary for me to commend him to you with my letters, since he is otherwise held in great esteem and reputation with you for the excellent gifts of the divine spirit, I did not want to allow that this man should proceed to you without my letters, in which I both make honorable mention of him, as is fitting, and at the same time do not neglect the opportunity to write to you, especially since a commentary on Moses written by me has recently been published, about which I am eager to know what you think; for I would greatly wish it to be pleasing to pious and learned men, among whom I am well aware of the place you hold with me. Farewell, and love me not because I often write to you, but because I love you with living letters written in my heart, and you also love me even when I do not write, in Him who calls Himself love and those who remain in love remain in Him. Farewell again, most illustrious man, and I wish all good men with you to be very well, Dominicus Pellicanus, Theodor Bibliander, Conrad Gesner, Zwingli, Rudolf Gwalther, and others. Basel, June 17.</p>
      <p>Martin Borrhaus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, vigilant pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
