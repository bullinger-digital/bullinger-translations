    <p xml:id="regest1">Returned hastily from a trip to Isny, which concerned church affairs, in anticipation of a letter from Bullinger; thanks and sends the messenger back with news. Is pleased about the letter from the excellent Philipp [Melanchthon] to Bullinger [No. 1881], which gives hope for calmer times after the death of Luther. Thanks for the report on the discovery [of the tomb of Emperor Honorius] in Rome and for the [note attached to the report] about the Vandal Stilicho. How sad the times would be if God did not enlighten us through the Gospel; Bullinger should pray for [the people of Konstanz]. Greetings. Will pay the messenger.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Having set out to Isny on the fourteenth day before the calends of May for the public affairs of our church, I hastened my return, my dear Bullinger, more eagerly because I did not doubt that you would soon write to me again about our common matters. Nor was my presumption mistaken; for having returned home yesterday, I found your writings, for which I would thank you beyond the usual manner, if I did not see that there is no need for such things between you and me. Therefore, having dismissed these matters, it seemed fitting to send this messenger back to you, to inform you of what seems necessary for you to know. May the Lord turn everything to our good, to whom I commend you and all yours as diligently as I can, and I earnestly wish that we may be commended to Him by you in return.</p>
      <p>The letter from Philipp [Melanchthon] to you delighted me as nothing has for a long time. This man excels not only in piety and learning but also in the sharpness of judgment and singular modesty of spirit, so that there will be less turmoil if, after Luther's death, he survives for some time.</p>
      <p>The writings you sent about the treasure found in Rome were most welcome, especially those which your diligence ensured were noted about Stilicho the Vandal.</p>
      <p>Ah, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, how utterly deplorable the state of all things would be in our age if our most excellent and kind Father did not enlighten us with the Gospel of Christ, His Son, and receive us into a certain most tranquil harbor, by which blessing we ought rightly to consider ourselves fortunate, even if the prince of this world turns everything upside down and mixes heaven with earth. You should diligently intercede with Him for us, so that relying on this one sacred anchor, we may laugh at all the storms of the world as if from a height.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again with all yours. Commend me to Lord RÃ¶sti and the other venerable brothers to me. April 24.</p>
      <p>I am now sending this third messenger to you; I counted 24 florins for the two previous ones and will count 12 for this one as well, unless delays imposed there force him to defer his return beyond the fourth day.</p>
