      <p>Greetings. Although I am not unaware, most honorable sir and most revered father, that I can never repay your many services, with which you have so generously and in many ways favored me, unworthy as I am, beyond my expectation and opinion, I will nevertheless keep all your friendships in memory as long as life is granted to me, so that I will continuously proclaim them with reverence for you among all good people and will easily surpass any dutiful persons with obedience and readiness of spirit.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus abundantly supply and recompense with His manifold grace all that is lacking in me (which I know to be infinite). Amen. It remains for me to inform you briefly that I have reached my family safely. My departure was quite favorable; when I was about to board the ship in Wesen and was about to set sail, I encountered a wedding party, which we expect here shortly.</p>
      <p>Between Ragaz and Chur, I met Captain Rudolf von Salis from Malans. When asked what was happening and what news there was, he replied that Chur was filled with the rumor that the Prince of Condé had been expelled from the entire kingdom of France and had neither place nor plan left. I simply denied this based on hearsay and showed nothing but the printed account of recent events. When I arrived, I met several people, from whom I heard most consistently that all good people were inflated and filled with such false rumors by I know not what winds. The next day, I encountered Mr. Charles; he reported quite differently and presented a document he had received from a friend in Maienfeld; this was brought by the pastor who recently corrected some books for you, and coming directly from Bern, he had obtained it from a certain Neuchâtel, who is said to have spent 4 months in the Prince of Condé's camp. The essence of these letters is that the Prince of Condé has with him both infantry and cavalry incredibly well-equipped, 35 banners from Gascony, 5000 musketeers, the rest excellently armed, also from the French 34 banners of infantry, 10000 French cavalry, from the Germans 8000 cavalry and 3000 landsknechts (foot soldiers), and also a moderate number of cannons. Around the beginning of January, trumpeters with quite a few nobles were sent by the king to the Prince of Condé's camp, seeking Castiglione as an intermediary; 4000 German cavalry are also said to be equipped in Speyer and Strasbourg and around, and to be standing as if in battle formation, ready to be called to the Prince of Condé's aid at any time; the Queen of England is also said to have presented 20000 men to the Prince of Condé, and to be waiting in maritime places to be led into France when needed; Marshal de Montmorency and Mr. d'Anville are said to have defected from the king with 500 cavalry, refusing to take up arms against the French nobility, etc. - Today, Mr. Bonetto and your Logarnensis, Francis Michaelis, who has returned from Milan or Venice, approached me, affirming that it has been announced and written in Rome that peace has been made and that the Queen herself has been seen in the Prince of Condé's camp; the Pope is said to be in turmoil and to bear it very badly. - What has been done with our bishops, you have already heard; for it is entirely as was then written.</p>
      <p>The archpriest is said to have gone to Rome to accuse the other anew; he has the Pope as his most intimate friend, as he has been used in Rhaetia in a mutual and very familiar manner. He promises himself much from this old acquaintance. If we are not mistaken, he will cause new disturbances. For all the Salis are angry that they are forced to extinguish their own fire. The rest another time.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my most revered father. May Jesus Christ, our Savior, eternally support you, so that you may never fail His church to its detriment. Kindly greet my dear Mr. Erni and all the most revered fathers and brothers there. In turn, Mr. Consul and Mr. Pontisella, Mr. Gantner, Mr. Charles, and everyone good greet you. Quickly. Chur, February 24, 1568.</p>
      <p>Yours most observantly, Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most renowned Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most revered father. Zurich.</p>
