      <p>Grace and peace to you from God the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>For your diligent efforts in your letters towards the ministers of Bern and for my own benefit, I give thanks and will continue to give immortal thanks, most kind Heinrich. Your many kindnesses to me, when I was with you in Bremgarten, were immense. With what gifts of sacred literature did you not endow me? With what wit did you not address me while walking? With what refreshments in your home did you not satisfy me? With what honors did you not honor me? Finally, you could not restrain your spirit towards me with your greetings, even if not with letters. The memory of all these things will never be erased.</p>
      <p>Also, to inform you of my current situation, know that I am still residing in Zofingen, instructing the youth there in the vernacular language and serving the ministers of the gospel in the town and around me with the word of God, as I was accustomed to do with you.</p>
      <p>My wife is near childbirth, we have four daughters, the provisions are scarce, and the burden to work or earn is almost none. Yet, help from the Lord and the strongest hope in God, by which He has wonderfully nourished me and my household thus far. The Lords of Bern have ordered me to remain in Zofingen to await etc. Therefore, I earnestly request your humanity, remembering our mutual friendship, as I do not doubt you will be: To be an instrument of God in aid to me and mine, where convenient and necessary, I ask again. As for your encouragement through certain messengers, namely Sebastian the Steward and Johann Bryttnow, it will happen at your expense around autumn, God willing, or whenever you request me by your letters: Soon your GuÍ¤tschenckel and your wife Fenderli will be at your service.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I ask you to greet your most beloved Penelope and Siren, that parent Griseum, the game hunter, the bird scarer, the fish destroyer, and Bishop Johann your brother from the valley of tears of Ottenbach, your most beloved and sweetest mother, Lord Wernher Steyner, the prothonotary of the city, Jacob Funck, and finally your entire family.</p>
      <p>Farewell in good health and keep me in your thoughts. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Hastily from Zofingen, on the 21st day of the month of August in the year of our Savior 1532.</p>
      <p>Your humble</p>
      <p>Georg Cardelius of Eripolis.</p>
      <p>Write to me often, so that I may have a reason to write to you.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and faithful Master Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiastic of Zurich, his much esteemed teacher, etc.</p>
