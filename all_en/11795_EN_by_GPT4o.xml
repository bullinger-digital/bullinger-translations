    <p xml:id="regest1">That drunkard who came to Zurich to be examined for leprosy has left without saying goodbye, which is why Bullinger has held back the letter to Vadian until now and is now sending it through [Walter] Klarer; he does not want to deny his support to him, but his sons [Abraham and Lukas] have already been granted more than many a citizen's son. Has no news except for the various rumors about the death of the Emperor [Charles V.] and the claim that he has come to Italy; believed Vadian had long since seen the apostolic brief with which [Pope Paul III.] invites the Swiss to Trent, otherwise he would have sent it earlier; now gives it to [Walter] Klarer, but would like to get it back; [the Pope] does it in his way, we will do it in ours.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>That drunkard, who came here to be examined for leprosy, left without saying goodbye to me; hence, I have retained the letters I had written to you until now; I am now sending them through Mr. Klarer, our beloved brother. I have helped as much as I could, and I will not deny my support to Klarer in the future, but in such a way that I do not appear to have acted beyond what is proper. There are many sons of citizens who have not yet received what his have.</p>
      <p>I have no news of what they call new matters, except that we hear many spreading some rumors about the death of the Emperor, while others again firmly assert that the Emperor has come to Italy. I thought you had long since seen the apostolic brief, by which the Swiss are called to Trent, otherwise I would have sent it sooner; now I am sending it through Mr. Klarer, but in such a way that you return it. He acts in his way, we will act in ours. Farewell, my dear Vadian, and love me.</p>
      <p>Zurich, the last day of May, at the ninth hour of the night, in the year 1543.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
