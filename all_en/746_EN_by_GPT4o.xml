      <p>Exception of the ministers of Lausanne against the mandate.</p>
      <p>This latter advice, being much more reasonable than the former, is also more approved by us: but in the fourth chapter, we require that in our academy, for those reasons which we have more fully explained in our letters to you, before the brother departs, not only the dean and both professors but also anyone else may be allowed to express their opinion, yet in a proper and orderly manner.</p>
      <p>As for the sixth chapter and the entire nature of the advice, why it seems to us most bitter and indeed intolerable, we believe you have understood from our letter.</p>
      <p>This is the sum of our petition and complaint, which we indeed commend to you most earnestly, for your utmost piety and also your ancient connection with the entire Bernese church. May the Lord keep you.</p>
