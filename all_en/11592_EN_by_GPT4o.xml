He is convinced that his exposition of the doctrine, that Christ lives in His own, corresponds to the Confession, although he could not formulate freely, as he had to adhere to the biblical passage to be explained; he does not wish to incite new disputes in any way. He regrets the unfortunate incident [arrest of Werner Steiner?]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. While I was lecturing on the First Epistle to the Corinthians and reached the passage concerning the use of the Lord's Supper, which you know, the brothers asked me to explain my opinion on this matter very clearly. I deliberated with Myconius and Markus [Bertschi] about whether anything should be publicly introduced on this matter at this time; for I knew the opinions of people there and how differing their minds still are, and I am so content with the essence of our confession that, if anyone asks me, I think it is a fine response if I answer what it contains. Although these things are so, nevertheless, since the passage itself and the faith of my profession compelled me to speak everything without dissimulation, when I saw that the matter was within the walls, I dictated these things, which you see here, to the brothers not with the intention that they should also be published, but to satisfy my profession and necessity, however, I was circumvented. I send it to you, so that, if it seems appropriate, you may read it. I think it does not deviate a nail's breadth from our confession. This is my judgment; I would gladly acknowledge your opinion. I assure you that I have no intention of differing from what has been so often and with such faith and diligence received by our churches. For the force of my opinion is entirely in this, to show how Christ truly lives in His own, if indeed that heavenly life is in pious men. However, He lives no differently than through the word and administration of the church.</p>
      <p>I hope this opinion will not be disapproved by you. I often speak obscurely; for thus is my speech, when it is not carried as it wishes, but exists within constraints and conforms to the prescribed place. For the passage of the apostle had to be expressed. Whatever it is, I desire to agree and conspire with you and the best so much that I would rather die than stir up new quarrels in the church.</p>
      <p>Regarding the calamity that has befallen you, I testify to the Lord that it is a great sorrow to my heart. I pray to you, Jesus Christ, that you may be willing to spare your church and glorify your name throughout the world. Amen.</p>
      <p>I commend myself to all of you, my dearest brothers in Christ, and to your pious prayers. May the Spirit of Christ be with you. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your S. Gryn√§us.</p>
      <p>To his dear brother in the Lord, Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
