    <p xml:id="regest1">[Hans] Vogler has written, who may pass on the news - about the truth of which Erb is uncertain - to Bullinger; he asks him to share them only with caution. Germany is in turmoil; preparations for war are underway, yet the Gospel is also gaining strength; Erb hopes that the warring parties will neutralize each other. Greetings. Request for mutual intercession.</p>

      <p>Greetings, dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have written much to our Vogler, an old friend to whom I owe a great deal of kindness, about my condition and that of the church. I have added news that is being spread among us, but how true it is, I do not know; for just as the world is unstable, so too is rumor among us (more changeable than any east wind) gaining strength through falsehoods. These may be presented to you for reading. I pray, as you are accustomed, that in your exceptional wisdom you consider everything for the best, and then share it with those who cannot brand me as a trifler or a vain man, etc.</p>
      <p>I see Germany trembling with its princes and cities to such an extent that many are almost on an expedition. Yet Christ does not remain silent amidst these tumults, but His Gospel exerts its strength more powerfully. They threaten each other with great things and almost destruction, but I hope, es soll ein schwert das ander in der scheiden behalten (one sword will keep the other in its sheath).</p>
      <p>May you be well with your church and brothers, whom you will greet by name, especially Erasmus, my Megander, Pellican, etc.</p>
      <p>In haste, Riquewihr, April 3, 1543. Pray to the Lord for me, as I will do the same for you, dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant churchman among the Zurichers, his dearest brother.</p>
