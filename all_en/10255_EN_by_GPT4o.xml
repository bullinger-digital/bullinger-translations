    <p xml:id="regest1">Did not want to disturb the very busy Bullinger in his work and therefore has not reported anything yet. He has written extensively to Pelikan. Briefly reports on the stay in Paris, the reason for the onward journey to Bourges, and the study situation there. Urgently requests the sending of money. Greetings.</p>

      <p>To the faithful preacher of the Holy Scriptures, Heinrich Bullinger, Johannes Fries wishes grace and peace from God.</p>
      <p>Most excellent man, I am aware that you are overwhelmed by countless waves of business, partly due to the simple task of preaching the gospel, and partly due to the immense labor imposed on you in writing books, which can provide knowledge of the Christian matter even to those living abroad. For this reason, I did not want to disturb your constant dedication with my trivialities. Otherwise, I would have begun writing about my life status at the very hour I left Zurich. Therefore, I did not want to burden you, who are devoted to more necessary matters, with vain things. But if you desire to know my condition, I would like you to approach our Pelikan, to whom I have written everything extensively. He will inform you about some recent events in Paris. However, so that I do not digress further, I will get to the point briefly.</p>
      <p>You know, most humane man, with what spirit and plan we undertook this journey, and what reason drove you, who granted us the opportunity to leave, namely, to pursue the cultivation of the mind and to learn the customs of foreign nations, which make a man not only prudent or skillful but also steadfast and unshaken in both adverse and favorable circumstances, especially one who, seeing the wicked equipped with wicked arts, can guard himself against such things and kindly warn others to avoid evil. But why do I tell you this, who have long experienced it? Therefore, I think it should be passed over in silence, and I will briefly explain the intention of the mind, on which the whole matter hinges, according to my small ability. As soon as we arrived in Paris, we immediately discussed among ourselves what needed to be done. One advised that it would be better to stay in Paris for a few months, while the other insisted on setting out towards Bourges. Finally, it seemed better to stay in Paris. Then the next question was about lodging. It is not obtained for less than one and a half florins each month. This seemed more than enough for our small purse. Furthermore, we inquired about the cost of living with a citizen. They affirmed it would be 40 or more florins each year. Then our mind and plan changed, and we turned our journey directly to Bourges. There we found the greatest scarcity of provisions and saw that studies, except for law, were completely neglected in the liberal arts. Although we felt these things would be less beneficial for us, we were nevertheless compelled to remain, exhausted by the long journey. I have written these things, most excellent man, for this reason, so that you may see how much our purse has suffered. Therefore, I beg your kindness to send money to us as soon as possible. For you are the only one in whom we trust as a faithful patron, and in whose protection we have placed our hope - I speak of that hope which one uses towards another. Therefore, if you abandon us, we perish. Finally, I beg and urge that we may always have the opportunity to enjoy your counsel. Kindly advise us through whatever you see will be to our advantage.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my sweet protection and honor. I wish your family well. You will greet Theodor, Carolostadt, on my behalf with due respect. You will also diligently greet Mr. Heinrich Utinger and Nikolaus Wiss.</p>
      <p>Given hastily in Bourges, under the King of the Franks, on the 14th day of May in the year 1533.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Fries, as devoted as he is.</p>
      <p>To the faithful preacher of the gospel, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed patron. In Zurich.</p>
