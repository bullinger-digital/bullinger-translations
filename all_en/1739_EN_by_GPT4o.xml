      <p>Greetings. Honorable sir, I have received your letter, written on October 1st, and read it with good gentlemen and brothers.</p>
      <p>May God bring it to a better end, for the beginning has a certain appearance; when the lands come together for the emperor's cause, it happens to the king as it did to the imperial cities when they let them come to the emperor from the peasants, etc. There is nothing special with us, except I heard a speech from our consul Ambrosius, that in Rome, three Spanish cardinals wanted to capture the pope and send him to the emperor. The cardinals were secretly armed in their houses with military equipment. Outside the city of Rome, Don Diego, who was the commander in Siena, was also secretly prepared with his Spanish troops, and when the pope rode out late to greet him. The matter came out through a Frenchman and was prevented by other French cardinals, and the pope was warned. - In the Engadin, there is talk of Turks, but a battle has taken place in Austria; this is what was written to Mr. Philipp. God have mercy on poor Christendom. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell. From Chur, October 11, 1552. Greeting all good gentlemen and brothers.</p>
      <p>Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger.</p>
