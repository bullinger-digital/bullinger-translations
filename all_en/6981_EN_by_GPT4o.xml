      <p>The prince replied, as I had guessed he would, that he had not been given the authority by his father to receive anyone into his household.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I do not doubt that he would have most gladly accepted the young man, who was recommended to him by your most honorable senate and by you, to whom he attributes much. Therefore, in the meantime, while he obtains his father's response, we have placed him with a certain friend, a most honorable man, with whom also resides the cousin of Navarre and several other noble students, with whom I know he will live comfortably and honorably. The cost of the pension is higher than we would wish, namely fifty crowns; but the prices of all things have increased so much that he could hardly have found a suitable host in this city under other conditions. However, I hope that soon the prince, having received his father's response, will admit him. But if it should happen otherwise and the expense here seems too great to Baron von Hohen Sachsen, we will also make an effort to find a place where he can live for less. Finally, I wish to assure both his parent and you that the young man's studies and entire life will be of the utmost concern to us, which d. Roset, who sends his most dutiful greetings to you, also promises.</p>
      <p>Regarding the testimony of the Scottish churches, I had not noticed what you write about the Augsburg Confession; we leave the entire matter to your judgment. Concerning our affairs, everything is still peaceful by the grace of God, and I do not think there are any happier than us today, if only we recognize our blessings and, even more, acknowledge and worship the author of all these things, as is fitting. However, there is no doubt that if the forces of Philip pass through the vicinity, as is the constant rumor, great danger threatens us, but we hope that the Lord, in his singular goodness, will turn it upon the heads of his enemies rather than allow any harm to befall us, even if they were to achieve their desires, since by God's grace we are among those for whom all things work together for good. Regarding the Flemish churches, what I have always feared, I still fear, that they may be found more courageous in daring than prudent in managing the whole affair. Some are seeking pardon for past actions; some are taking refuge in France with their families, and many more, I think, in neighboring England. Valenciennes is already oppressed by many nearby garrisons, although one or two incursions have turned out favorably for the citizens. They have been given three options, unless they wish to be proscribed: one, to admit a garrison; two, to hold sacred assemblies outside the city, that is, to allow themselves to be excluded from the city; three, to either abstain entirely from the sacraments or to follow papal rites in them. They have bravely responded that they will do none of these things. Therefore, they have been judged enemies by the Mechelen senate. The city itself is the arsenal of the entire region, and it is reported that up to eight thousand armed soldiers have already been gathered inside. What will happen, the Lord knows. I indeed hardly dare to hope that piety and charity will grow through wars and arms, which I see we need more than knowledge now. Yesterday, letters were brought to us written from Antwerp on the 8th of the previous month, indicating that the nobility had gathered there to decide on appointing a leader and other matters necessary for war, and all are looking to Count Horn; it seems that Orange and Egmont have decided to be spectators rather than actors.</p>
      <p>Would that everything were truly right!</p>
      <p>Whether Philip himself will cross is not yet decided, as the heads of his council, Duke of Alba and Prince of Imola, are in disagreement. It is said that Savoy refused to take Philip's place in this expedition unless both the Spanish and the French withdrew their garrisons from certain towns, which each still holds in his domain according to the terms of peace. Nevertheless, soldiers are being gathered throughout Italy with the most holy pontiff sounding the trumpet, even though he has expelled the Jews, abolished the office of penance, forbidden masses to courtesans, walked barefoot to Rome several times, and promulgated the strictest laws on the beards and garments of priests. For with these arts, the most holy father hopes to easily erase all the stains of his ancestors. May the Lord be with us and reveal Satan, transformed, to the eyes of all, so that no one may be deceived any longer! The reports of the Spanish troops crossing do not seem credible to me, nor do I think Philip would risk exposing either a defenseless Italy or one fortified only with recruits to the Turks; yet I believe we must be vigilant and pray as never before. In England, I hear things are in a very bad state, and the luxury of that place grows daily, to which, however, the bishops have entrusted everything to its will and discretion. But what good can come of it, I indeed do not see, since ambition and greed have already driven them mad, no less than the papists. I ask you, if you receive any happier news from there, let us also share in your joy. In France, the churches continue and emerge, but very slowly; for many are already weary of the cross of Christ, some reject the yoke, others look to the king, and while they seek their own, they gradually lose Christ. Everything has been promised profusely to the German envoys; but all these are mere mockeries of Christ, with the queen caring for this one thing and devoting all her efforts to hindering the work of the Lord. Do not believe, either, how poorly and ungenerously the meager stipend is paid to the poor pastors in most places. Now they openly come forth, and indeed, what you might wonder, with that insane Postel as their leader, who call themselves deists and openly and with impunity mock everything written about Christ.</p>
      <p>Atheists also now freely express their blasphemies, and any filth from the papists is tolerated against us.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, the churches continue, and although not with the growth that is fitting, they still grow through the midst of difficulties.</p>
      <p>However, to freely confess what I feel, I hardly dare to hope that we will ever see Christ triumphant in France as we did a few years ago when persecutions pressed, even if the papacy is abolished and the affairs of Flanders, on which all eyes are now fixed, succeed well. The king, besides the legionary foot soldiers and his cavalry troops, who are all ordered to be armed at the beginning of spring, is also gathering a band of Swiss and Germans, so that the former, stationed along the borders of Burgundy, and the latter, along the borders of Champagne, may prevent Philip's forces from invading the kingdom, as he indeed declares. But I wish there were no other plan, although against the most powerful God of hosts, there is no place for cunning. The admiral, having complained bitterly and for a long time about that disaster at Flers, has achieved nothing. Meanwhile, the Lord has stirred up the most impious son of the most impious father, a certain Monluc of Aquitaine, who, with several armed ships at Bordeaux and a gathered band of the most desperate robbers, pretending to want to trade, suddenly became a pirate, invaded Madeira, a noble and wealthy island of the King of Portugal near the Canaries, where the best sugar is made, and most miserably and cruelly ravaged the entire place, destroyed the fortress and city, took away ships laden with many captives, whom he will undoubtedly sell to the barbarous Ethiopians, cut down the sugar canes, and to cover all these crimes with the appearance of religion, even burned the temples with their idols, drowned all the priests and monks in the sea. He himself is said to have died from a wound six days later; but the robbers immediately appointed another no better in his place and, setting sail from there, have progressed further, and nothing has been heard of them since that time. You see with what instruments the Lord sets the impious against each other. May he further grant that, with the helms of his flock entrusted to us through these waves, he himself may guide us with his spirit, and may we all together finally reach the harbor!</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father. All the colleagues greet you and your entire church. I also commend myself to your private prayers and those of the other brothers.</p>
      <p>Geneva, on the calends of January, which I pray will be prosperous for you and the entire assembly. May the Lord Jesus keep you and bless your labors more and more.</p>
      <p>Your Beza.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Christ, d. Heinrich Bullinger, the truly faithful pastor of the Zürich church, my most esteemed father.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
