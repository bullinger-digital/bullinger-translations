    <p xml:id="regest1">Expresses, in retrospect of the personal encounter, his gratitude and love and wishes to prove himself a worthy student. Hopes that Bullinger, who tends towards excessive modesty, will publish his commentaries on Isaiah and other writings; especially his interpretation of the Pauline Epistles is praised everywhere; and the mere commercial success testifies to the appreciation of his works, which will bring great benefit to the Church. Sends greetings to Bibliander, Jud, Pellikan, Beat [Gering], and [Georg] Binder and regrets that he has not yet been able to write to them. Also sends greetings to Bullinger's brother [Johannes] and conveys a greeting from his host Antoine Saunier.</p>

      <p>Although I know, most esteemed teacher, that I owe so much to your kindness, which you have always shown to me in an extraordinary and singular manner, that I seem unable to repay it with any services, work, labor, or diligence of mine; yet, considering that nothing is more ungrateful than not to testify to what you owe when you cannot repay it, I have decided to send you some letters, in which I might testify my feelings towards you, express my goodwill, and finally give thanks for your many and great merits towards me: however, I recognize that I owe you much more, and I think much more highly of you than I can express with any words, however many and magnificent they may be. Therefore, if I do not write to you as much now as my mind and the duty of my office demand, I beg you to forgive my inexperience, and I hope you are nonetheless fully convinced that I am entirely yours, as much as I am. For I testify before Him, who sees into the deepest recesses of the human heart, that I love no one more than you; there is no one whom I respect, cherish, and admire more, and to whom I am more sincerely devoted than to you: and I do this rightly, for I now console myself with the mere memory of you, considering it no small part of my happiness that I have seen you, conversed with you, lived with you in your house, and had you as a teacher, who have shaped my mind with such a doctrine of faith and piety, and instructed me with such an example of your life so upright, that nothing should be more in my wishes than to prove myself a disciple worthy of such a great teacher; which I will certainly strive for with all my strength, and I will diligently act so that I may never seem to miss any opportunity of place or time to show the duty of a grateful disciple towards his teacher. Meanwhile, I do not cease to beseech God Almighty with constant prayers, that He may preserve you safe and sound for me and for His church for as long as possible: for the use of which church, due to that usual zeal of your mind in promoting the glory of Christ, I am well aware that you would have long since published not only your commentaries on Isaiah but also your other works, if it had not been hindered (you will pardon me if I speak too boldly) by the useless persuasion of your mind, by which, although your writings satisfy all others greatly, they never satisfy you yourself; so much so that if you do not despise them, you still attribute much less to them, and think much more humbly of yourself than their dignity and the great and rare grace given to you by God rightfully demand. With what skill, with what purity and simplicity of faith you have explained the sacred scriptures, especially the epistles of Paul, is testified not only by the church of Zürich but by all the other churches that are in Christ. How much everyone values your commentaries, how eagerly they embrace and cherish them, to pass over countless other arguments, let the most wealthy booksellers be witnesses, whom you see almost made into Croesuses suddenly from being poorer than Iro and Codrus by the sale of your writings alone. May God therefore give you the mind to publish all your writings as soon as possible; by doing so, you will not only fill the pockets of booksellers but will win many souls for Christ and adorn His church with the most beautiful gems. And so much for this.</p>
      <p>I would here inform you how welcome your letters were, and with what kindness we were treated everywhere for your sake, and what the state of our affairs is, if I did not know that my companions have long since done so through their letters, so that I do not need to repeat it. Certainly, we have experienced your kindness everywhere, so that we cannot say that we had you present with us only in Zürich. Finally, we are indeed doing well, and that among honorable men, devoted to piety, and most loving of you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>I would ask you to accept these my hastily written words with a grateful mind, if I did not know you to be the most grateful of all, and I never cease to proclaim this. Therefore, I earnestly pray and beseech you with the most ardent prayers to greet the most illustrious men, Master Theodor Bibliander, Master Leo Jud, Master Pellikan, Master Beat [Gering], Master Binder, and the other pious men in my name as courteously as possible; and let them not think that I have not yet written to them out of forgetfulness of their kindness or my duty, but they should attribute it partly to the excessive barbarism, in which I recognize myself to be entangled more than in labyrinthine coils, and partly to the untimely departure of this courier. For there is nothing that I would not most willingly do to please them, to whom to do good is to receive the greatest benefit. I sincerely favor them as they deserve, and I pray for all good things for them, and I speak well of them and proclaim them daily; which I also do not cease to do for you.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell. I beg you, greet your dearest brother for me. Our most courteous host and your most loving friend, Master Antoine Saunier, sends you many greetings. Farewell for the third time.</p>
