    <p xml:id="regest1">Despite his attempt to resist the deceit, R端mlang must admit that Bern is now infested by the Lutherans or the Bucerans. The city of Bern, which can no longer cope with itself due to internal hostilities, seeks friendships in distant places while neglecting the nearby [allies]. Debauchery and arrogance are abundant in the successful Bern. The preachers flatter the rulers to spread their opinions more easily. They also mock the followers of the truth. R端mlang can no longer endure it. Just as the Zurichers have become unbearable to the Bernese, R端mlang can no longer tolerate Bern. Bullinger should provide him with a position that allows him to study in his homeland. - Spanish troops in Piedmont are planning something against Geneva. The Genevans are worried and are taking precautions. Troops are being called up, the guard is being reinforced, and a strategy is being developed. - Greetings to [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Heinrich] Buchter, Erasmus [Schmid], and to Bullinger's family.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from our Lord, most honorable Bullinger.</p>
      <p>You know that I have always tried to mitigate the deceit of our preachers (as I have always hoped for better things); I even risked myself by opposing them. But now, completely deprived of this hope, I can no longer dissimulate and must frankly admit that Bern is infected with the Lutheran or Buceran dregs, so that (being made arrogant and burdened by its own weight, which it knows as internal hatreds) it seeks and desires distant friendships while neglecting those nearby. Luxury and arrogance are so abundant among us that nothing surpasses it, and the more our preachers insinuate their opinions, the more they flatter the magnates and nobles. Thus, they scratch each other's backs. In return, they are gratified while mocking those who stand by the truth. How do you think, most excellent Bullinger, my heart, which I wished to be philosophical, is ulcerated? If only the matter could have been brought to a conference, which I often demanded, the roofs would have been repaired. But they have reached such a level of malice that they do not want to listen. They do not want to be advised or exhorted, having completely relegated all care for the truth to the preachers. We Zurichers are despised by the Bernese, who have forgotten all our good deeds; hence, not undeservedly, Bern is despicable to me. I wish, if it were possible, for a place to be prepared for me in my homeland under any condition, so that my dogs may have a refuge and asylum. You should advise me on what you think I should do, so that I may obey you, my faithful patron. Also, discuss this matter with your colleagues. I intend to vindicate myself from my duty and resign shortly, and then commit myself to fate and good men. I will refuse nothing, as long as I may grow pale over letters, etc.</p>
      <p>Bern has heard that Geneva is to be occupied by some Spaniards, who have served in the Piedmont region, through treachery; therefore, they have drafted an army to provide aid and keep watch. In Geneva, a thousand men are prepared if the enemy is heard to approach. Then, six thousand men are selected under the banner, with which they strive to repel the enemies. May God inspire that all things succeed healthily to the glory of His name and to the joy of our salvation! We are worthy and have abundantly deserved to be chastised by God's rod.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Hastily, on the 7th day of December in the year 1545. Please greet Gwalther, Buchter, Erasmus, and all those whose hearts my name clings to. May you and your entire family fare well once again.</p>
      <p>Yours, Eberhard von R端mlang.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, pious, and highly learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich at the Great Minster, his dear lord.</p>
