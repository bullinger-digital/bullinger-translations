      <p>I believe that the letters of Mr. Calvin have been delivered to you, my father, by which you have understood the state of the churches in France. If only the most bloody edict of the king were written in Latin, or if I had enough leisure now to translate it into Latin.</p>
      <p>You would see in a few pages every kind of cruelty that has been devised. But oh, the wondrous power of our God!</p>
      <p>So far from hindering the spread of the gospel, we feel that nothing is as beneficial for gathering the scattered sheep of Christ into one flock. Geneva alone can testify to this, as today so many exiles from all regions of France and Italy flock there that it can scarcely accommodate such a multitude.</p>
      <p>However, lest Satan leave anything untried, very recently, namely shortly after Mr. Calvin wrote to you, he attempted to stir up internal dissension in the Genevan church. For the one whose axioms on providence, predestination, and free will I recently left with you, although he had not yet declared open war on the churches, finally emerged from his hiding places and began to propose his doctrine most seditiously and impudently in the midst of the Genevan church assembly, even accusing, as I hear, Mr. Zwingli and the present Calvin by name, whom he alone among the ancients and moderns vociferated had corrupted the doctrine of predestination and free will. Calvin responded with such spirit that nothing seemed lacking in his piety and vehemence of speech, and in the judgment of the good, he clearly surpassed himself that day. Yet he remained in his opinion. Therefore, shortly after, he was thrown into prison by the magistrate as a seditious and manifest sycophant, where he continues to rage even now.</p>
      <p>This monstrous man emerged from the haunts of the Carmelites five years ago. Then, when he sought Italy, he was received into the household of the most religious princess of Ferrara and devoted himself to the practice of empirical medicine. Finally, having become odious to all there because of his turbulent nature, he withdrew to Geneva with his wife to practice his empiricism. Scarcely had he entered the city when he began to peddle his doctrine with great arrogance. Reprimanded and admonished by Calvin to be more sensible, he went to Vevay, a small town only four miles from us in the Bernese territory. There he wrote that excellent paraphrase and axioms which I left with you, not at all then thinking that this tragedy would be stirred up by him. Summoned by us, corrected, admonished, he never wanted to be taught. What more? When we refused to endure his madness any longer, he moved elsewhere, namely to a village near Geneva, and shortly after stirred up this tragedy, the outcome of which we now await.</p>
      <p>I beseech you, my father, were not such the beginnings of Anabaptism? But God grant better things. Although I do not doubt that you will soon learn the whole matter more fully and accurately described by Mr. Calvin himself, I wanted to remind you of this matter so that you too may hasten to extinguish this nascent fire. I therefore ask you to examine his doctrine and also to advise us briefly on what you think most pertinent to this cause. The main points of the cause are these: whether anyone is reprobated from eternity and therefore created by God to be a vessel of wrath? Are the reprobate reprobate because they are unbelievers, or on the contrary, are they unbelievers because they are reprobate, and therefore damned because they are unbelievers? From this arises the question of the powers of human free will. For the same must be established for the elect as for the reprobate. We confess that unbelievers are damned because of unbelief, and we attribute all the blame for condemnation to man. But in reprobation, we regard only the will of God, which alone is the rule of justice, and with Paul we exclaim: O the depth! But he cries out: that God is thus made by us the author of sin and like a tyrant, to whom will suffices for reason. For if, he says, God reprobates anyone, he does so because he foresaw that he would reject the grace offered to him, which he could have embraced. But if God therefore reprobates because he foresees unbelief, he also chooses because he foresees faith, although it is clear that we are not chosen because of faith, but therefore believe because we are chosen, otherwise election would depend on us, not on grace. We say therefore that he who removes reprobation can establish no election; we say that causes must be distinguished: we say that nothing should be attributed here to the judgment of our reason: we say that the various ends of sin must be considered, for as it is sin, all its blame is to be attributed to the wickedness of men, but as it depends on reprobation, it is decreed by God for the amplification of his glory by the punishment of the wicked. We say finally that in the reprobate there are three degrees to be considered in this order: reprobation, unbelief or ignorance of God, eternal death, to which correspond in the elect: gratuitous election, faith, eternal life. I beseech you, my father, if I have omitted anything here, if you think anything is ambiguously or harshly written by me, do not hesitate to advise me what you believe should be added, removed, or changed. For the matter is worthy of your singular piety, learning, judgment, and you would do a favor to all the churches, I think, if for the sake of the weak you would now also interpose your authority in establishing this matter.</p>
      <p>But I detain you too long. The blame for this matter must rest entirely on him who stirred up this whole controversy.</p>
      <p>For I do nothing more willingly than write to you, and I am so persuaded of your extraordinary kindness and singular benevolence towards me, that I dare to hope these letters, although longer, will be neither ungrateful nor unpleasant to you: I ask again and again that this hope may not deceive me. May the Lord Jesus preserve you for his church, my father. Mr. Viret, Ribittus, and the other brothers with me greet your whole church. My wife also greets you with the whole family. Farewell. Lausanne, the fourth day before the calends of November 1551.</p>
      <p>Theodorus Beza, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
