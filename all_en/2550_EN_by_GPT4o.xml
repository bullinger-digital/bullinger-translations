      <p>Eternal salvation in Christ Jesus. Just as I found in you, to my great consolation and benefit, pious advice, doctrine, and example when I was present in Zürich, so now, most esteemed father in Christ, I hope always to have your pious prayers as helpers in building the Church of Christ for the English in Frankfurt. And while many other Englishmen have you as their patron, I acknowledge that you have also been a father to me, and I hope and wish that you will continue to be so. And since I see myself deprived of all means and opportunity to give thanks, I write this now so that you may understand that I am neither forgetful nor ungrateful.</p>
      <p>Nothing certain from England; but from uncertain rumors, I have heard that the queen was not entirely pregnant and that the council, which they call parliament, was suddenly ended, and this because the king not only denied but also despised three petitions proposed by the magistrates. The first was to restore the true religion, the second to establish peace with the French, and the third to admit no one born outside of England to his councils. I understand that many seek consolation from vain rumors rather than from true repentance.</p>
      <p>Please do not hesitate, I ask, to greet my mother, your wife, and also the rest of your family in my name, for whom I will never cease to pray for the best. May the Lord Jesus keep you with us for a long time for the benefit of His church. Farewell. Frankfurt, February 12.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted son in Christ, Thomas Lever. To my most esteemed father in Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and pious pastor of the church.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
