      <p>Greetings. Although I wrote to you a few days ago, I did not want Froschauer to return to you without a letter. Your relative was summoned to the margrave's advisors; however, he did not come himself due to ill health on the appointed day. Whether he has visited them in the meantime, I have not yet been able to find out; however, I hope this delay is without danger, provided the Lord restores the good man sooner. As for new matters to write about, I have nothing except for the military preparations of Philipp, which they report to be a hundred banners of infantry, and fifteen thousand cavalry in number.</p>
      <p>The French, however, are far inferior in strength and are struck with great fear along with their own. Where this gamble of Mars will fall, the Lord knows, who may guide the matter to His glory and the successful outcome of His kingdom. Amen. For the copy of the Apocalypse you ordered to be given to me, I am grateful and will nonetheless repay either you or my Oporinus. Now, I sincerely pray that you and yours are well in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 12, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Johannes Jung.</p>
      <p>To the man of esteemed learning and piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my venerable lord and brother.</p>
