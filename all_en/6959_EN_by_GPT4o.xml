      <p>S. P. D. Our Lord Gantner shared with me the letters sent to him by your kindness, in which, when I read the greetings addressed to me and the congratulations on my new dignity, I perceived the traces of your ancient love towards me, as you remember me and congratulate me so lovingly. But, my most humane Mr. Bullinger, I would like you to believe me that this dignity was offered to me beyond my expectation and much more against my will, and indeed, neither envy, hatred, dangers, nor labors, which must be undertaken and experienced by all involved in the republic, bring me as much fear as the thought of my limited resources terrifies me; for when I assess myself by my own abilities, whether of intellect or even of resources and wealth, I understand that I am by no means sufficiently equipped, indeed I acknowledge myself entirely unequal to bearing such a great burden. For what prudence (consistent with the experience and practice of the greatest matters and especially necessary for those managing the republic) would there be for him who has been detained until now in scholastic dust and whose nature of intellect has shunned public assemblies? Moreover, my domestic affairs are not so ample that I would not need the scholastic function for the support of my family in the future. Therefore, neither my public nor my private affairs were consulted when I was thrust into that order. But this must be attributed to the lack of our republic, otherwise, I would not have been promoted to it in any way; yet good hope holds my mind, that shortly others will emerge, so that I may be freed from it again, and our most honorable senate has promised me that they will take care and even ensure that I am not deprived of my scholastic office. If this happens, it will be borne with a more equitable mind, such inconvenience and annoyance. May the most gracious Lord God direct all this to the propagation of His glorious name and most holy word. But to our Lord Stephan Willi, true congratulations are due, who (as you, Lord, have heard by reputation) has attained the highest degree of honor among us due to his most pleasant manners, prudence, and integrity of life, and has been declared consul with the greatest congratulations of our entire city. Although we have had excellent consuls before, in him we have the highest hope, and there is no doubt that as much as he can strive with strength, provide with counsel, and move with authority, all this will be for the republic. Above all, however, he will focus on that care and thought which brings dignity and glory to the most holy gospel of Jesus Christ. Therefore, not so much for his dignity, but for the happiness of having such a consul, congratulations are due. May the best and greatest God deign to preserve him for us in health for the years of Nestor, so that our republic, almost overturned by the corruption and debauchery of offices, may breathe again and recover its former strength. As for the decree of the senate you recently requested to be sent to you regarding the episcopal matter, I would like you to know, Lord, that no other exists than what our senate has recently taken care to write to your most honorable senate. But what the bishop himself (when he was admitted to the bishopric by those communities, which had won by only one vote) undertook to do and confirmed with his own seal, I have faithfully transcribed the example, as it was recited in our senate and communicated to me by the most honorable Lord Consul Willi, and I send it to you, Lord. And hereafter, if I can gratify you, Lord, by writing or sending anything, I will do so with a very willing mind, provided you command what you wish me to do. For the old and great merits of yours towards me have not yet fallen from my mind, but indeed, while I live, I will not cease to pursue them with grateful memory. Since I doubt that I can repay them in any way, indeed I would be troublesome by seeking new benefits from you, certainly unless I could be judged too impudent, I would even now approach as a suppliant, and certainly relying on your extraordinary kindness, I implore your assistance. When I was recently with you in Zurich and informed the most illustrious Lord Gwalther, my esteemed lord, about the state of my son, he, in his usual kindness and benevolence towards me, suggested that if I sent the diploma, which would testify that the royal stipend had been granted to my son, then there would be some hope (and this through the work of the magnificent Lord Cognetius) of obtaining this privilege for my son, that the sum of the stipend would be paid to him even if he resided elsewhere than in Paris. I have obtained the letters and send them. Now I would like to ask your kindness most earnestly, and remind Lord Gwalther of this matter and request in my name, that as much as could be conveniently done in this matter, he may accomplish; for I would very much like to send my son to you in Zurich, so that he may begin to know and love early the most famous city of all Switzerland, my former nurse, and the distinguished doctors of that city, my singular patrons and the most ardent defenders of purer faith. Nothing could happen to me more pleasing, nothing more desirable. If we achieve our wish, then certainly we will show ourselves grateful and mindful to all who have helped us with authority, counsel, and effort; if it does not succeed, nevertheless we will then take it in good part and console ourselves with that Terentian saying: "As we can" (they say), "since, as we wish, it is not allowed." I ask your kindness to forgive my impudence, never to be so troublesome in the future. However, I do not ask for a response to these my lengthy letters from you (occupied with far more serious matters). If Lord Tobias, whom we hope will be present soon, indicates with one word what hope there is, it will be enough. Now I cease to be troublesome and commend myself to your kindness. I pray with the highest prayers to the most merciful Lord God, that He may deign to preserve you for us and for the whole Christian republic for a very long time, safe and sound. The most honorable Lord Consul Willi ordered me to write many greetings to your kindness. From me also (if ever your kindness has leisure) I would like you to convey greetings to the most illustrious men and my singular patrons, Lords Rodolph Gwalther and Lavater, Ammianus, Collinus the elder, the Wolphs, and other learned men. May your kindness fare well. Chur, the day before the Ides of December, in the year 66.</p>
      <p>Johannes Pontisella, most loving and respectful of your kindness. To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, patron and lord to be honored and respected with perpetual faith.</p>
