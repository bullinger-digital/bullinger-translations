    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the support he received despite a transgression. He is no longer a stranger [in Thun] and is often invited along with his teacher Urs Völmi. On such occasions, he has heard complaints that the Zurich council sends godless bailiffs to the common lordships, as evidenced by the example of the Thurgau bailiff [Hans Edlibach]; Bullinger should admonish his people so that an enemy of the Gospel is not appointed as the successor to the Bernese bailiff in Baden [Benedikt Schütz]. Reports on the progress of his studies. Greetings.</p>

      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Archbishop of the Church of Zurich, my much-revered lord and patron, Diethelm Keller wishes happiness in Christ.</p>
      <p>Your benefits bestowed upon me are infinite, most honorable lord, and I would consider it inhuman and impious if I did not inform you of my most fortunate condition, which I have achieved through your help. I know that you greatly rejoice in the success of all scholars, especially your own. I give thanks for all the labor and trouble you have endured for my sake, not only in promoting this matter but also in the past, where I would have deservedly been rejected (I sincerely confess), had it not been for your great kindness towards me, which expected a more honorable way of life and correction of past errors. You will not be disappointed in this hope, unless God Almighty denies His help. For I would act impiously if I were to add a new sin to the previous one, and I would not be worthy to obtain your mercy, let alone God's; for I had erred. This has been forgiven me, but on the condition that nothing of the sort is committed henceforth. I will diligently ensure that this does not happen by praying to God to guide my steps with His spirit, not towards wickedness or depraved desire, but towards integrity of life and piety, by which my neighbor is helped, not offended.</p>
      <p>But to move on from these matters to others, know that I am quite delighted by the pleasantness of this place. Everything is abundantly present that can please the eyes. Our house, built on a hill overlooking the city, easily provides a view of long and very pleasant fields. The people also show me a pleasant familiarity, which affects me not a little. They do not treat me as a stranger, but as if I were born and raised there; they invite me to banquets along with my teacher and lord Urs Völmi, who is with us from the sermons. Often (I certainly cannot pass over this, so do not be annoyed to hear or read it) they ask me various questions in conversation, wondering why the people of Zurich always seem to choose impious officials for themselves (especially in the case where those five districts, along with the Bernese, usually appoint them in turns), who, succeeding the impious, do not equal but far surpass them in malice, impiety, and the oppression of the wretched, excelling greatly in oppressing the Gospel and afflicting the pious. This is undoubtedly due to the fault of the most corrupt council, which does not provide for the wretched subjects eagerly desiring evangelical truth, to benefit them in any way, but rather enriches the officials through the oppression of the wretched. This was evident from the one who was in charge of Thurgau, and they fear nothing more than that an impious person might succeed as the prefect of the Baths, who would undo what has already been transformed into a better form and substitute things entirely contrary to both justice and evangelical truth. That this does not happen is largely up to you (most honorable lord), if you frequently admonish them before the council not to reveal themselves as enemies of evangelical truth by the election of officials to be sent to the Baths. But by Hercules, I seem to be pouring water into the sea or carrying wood to the forest (as the proverb goes) by advising you to urge them, which you constantly do until you are hoarse. Therefore, most honorable lord, do not take it badly that I, in my ineptitude, bring this to you. For it is most distressing to me when I hear that the reputation of my homeland is suffering, and I very often pray to God (as God knows) to instill a more pious mind in our magistrates through His spirit, so that they may do and decide everything in conformity with the Gospel, lest others, who have not yet reached a perfect knowledge of God, be offended by impious actions, and instead of following the truth, which they do not yet know exactly but have tasted in some way, they pursue it with hatred and even try to eradicate it completely, as a religion deemed inept and worthless, which is not followed by a correction of life.</p>
      <p>But to return to my own state: Know that, as far as the progress of my studies is concerned, I am by no means neglected. I have a teacher who is faithful to me in all things, especially excelling and demonstrating in imparting education. He teaches the rudiments of Hebrew with such faith and diligence that it is difficult to describe. I exercise myself in Greek, and I continue in Latin as well as in Greek. If anything is lacking, I consult him in all things with his benevolent advice; for he explains everything willingly. Similarly, he did not demand too much for the annual sustenance. I voluntarily offered eighteen gold coins, which he accepted with a benevolent spirit and did not ask for anything more. Therefore, 14 gold coins still remain, which I can use for my needs. I have achieved everything according to my wishes, provided that Almighty God does not deny health of mind and body. To ensure this, I will continually weary Him with my prayers.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my Maecenas, and keep me, along with my parents, always commended to you, and consider this small token of my piety (which I rightfully owe you) with favor, hoping for better and even greater things from me.</p>
      <p>I earnestly ask you to greet your wife, children, and elderly mother in my name, and pray that this year begins with good omens, proceeds with better ones, and ends with the happiest.</p>
      <p>Thun, December 20th, in the year of human salvation 1535.</p>
      <p>Diethelm Keller, devoted to you, as much as he is.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, faithful preacher of the divine Gospel among the people of Zurich, his much-beloved lord. Zurich.</p>
