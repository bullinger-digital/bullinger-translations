      <p>Greetings and Peace. I am grateful that you have deigned to respond to my letters, venerable father and teacher in Christ, and that you have so sincerely and candidly advised me and indeed our entire French church here. You have thus made us all, already sufficiently bound to you, even more indebted. And indeed, the advice of you and all the brothers there, which you communicated to us regarding the Augsburg Confession, is very much approved by all of us, and it is not different from the advice of Mr. Calvin, but exactly the same. For the spirit of Christ Jesus is always and everywhere consistent with itself. Therefore, since we have so many pious and learned men, so many holy churches, and indeed the very word of God on our side, we will continue (with God's favor) in the faith, religion, and doctrine of Christ, the Son of God, as we have done so far, even if the world rages and Satan rises with all the gates of hell. This one thing we now ask of you, that you remember us in your holy prayers, so that the Lord God, the best and greatest, may continually guide us with His Holy Spirit in this way of truth and doctrine, and thus we may be able to fulfill our duty and strive directly towards the contest set before us. And we, in turn, will pray that the Lord may increase His Holy Spirit in you and bless your churches.</p>
      <p>Moreover, a few days ago, Mr. Calvin sent a booklet here to our preachers, which he recently wrote about the Holy Supper.</p>
      <p>It has indeed been received, but how it was accepted, I do not know. They have not yet responded, but they will respond. Then you will understand what the matter is. It is quite approved by all of us French. If only it were as well approved by all Germans.</p>
      <p>Our Beatus, who came here from Bern some time ago, is causing trouble for all the other preachers and is quite vexing the churches. He is wise in his own eyes, always the same to himself. His hand rages against all, to the point of nausea against the sacramentarians, so much so that he is not even approved by the Lutherans. For he neither understands nor is understood. May the Lord God bring him and those like him to a sounder mind and have mercy on us all. Meanwhile, may you remain perpetually happy with your entire holy church. May the Lord God keep you safe for a long time for His church. Amen. I wish to greet all my fathers and teachers in Christ, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Gwalther, and the other pious brothers and ministers of the word of God. My colleague, along with all the elders of our church, sends you many greetings. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, March 22, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Jean Garnier.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his teacher and superior in the Lord, these are given.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
