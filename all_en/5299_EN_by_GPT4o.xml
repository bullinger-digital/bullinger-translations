      <p>Your letter, which you (my dear gracious lord) wrote to me very kindly and blessedly on the 24th of August in the year 1562, I have received and read with great joy in my heart. In which you not only inform us that you, your dear wife, all your children, sons, daughters, and sons-in-law, have not forgotten us, but also reveal and show your great concern that you bear for us, our country, and our queen. For which and also for all other good deeds, we thank you very heartily and sincerely.</p>
      <p>The fact that my lord and I have not written before this time is not due to forgetfulness or negligence, nor that our love towards you has diminished, but rather my lord's great business and also partly illness have prevented it. For on the first Sunday of Advent, my lord preached in Norwich, and it was very cold, and my lord also became so cold that after he came home, he fell into a faint for three days one after the other, so that we all feared that a great and serious illness would follow. But the almighty God, who does not forsake his own, has preserved him by his grace and made him healthy from the illness. Not long after, I fell into the cold; but God (to whom be all praise, honor, and glory) has made me healthy again. And this is the reason for our silence.</p>
      <p>We have heard about the council in Trent; but no one from our country has gone there nor should or will go there as long as the Pope holds it. May the almighty God give us all grace and assistance, that we all live according to his divine will and pleasure and avoid and leave all evil and wickedness that might provoke his wrath upon us. Greet your dear wife, all your children, sons, daughters, and sons-in-law, and all other good gentlemen and friends and all of Zurich for me. Given on the 24th of April in the year 1562 in Ludham.</p>
      <p>M[argareta] P[arkhurst].</p>
      <p>To the wise and well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, church servant in Zurich, to her gracious lord's hands. Zurich.</p>
