      <p>God with us. I have no letters or news.</p>
      <p>I had a German book about witches with illustrations, and I believe you took it home with you to read. I would like to have it back now; if you wish, I will return it to you later. Please look for it and send it to me via Herr Konrad Pellican or bring it to me yourself. If you want to give me some wine, please give me white, not red. God be with you.</p>
