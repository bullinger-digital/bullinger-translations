      <p>You will learn what has been done both before and after the arrival and departure of our lords from the attached writing, as much as I could gather in haste, most reverend father. However, I do not want what I am sending to be shared with many until everything has been more fully proven and verified by me; for in a few things I have some doubts. But if I have written the introduction, and then also gathered the conclusion of everything, I will make an effort to continue this little history with many omissions, but with many other things inserted, which, because I have them in other lengthy writings, I did not want to waste time depicting. - I commend to your kindness the most noble Baptist von Pero, the standard-bearer of Clavonn, who (as the acts testify) has partly made an agreement with Duke Baptist von Salis, who still threatens the greatest danger from the common people, and partly will hardly be able to obtain the remainder of his sum without the intercession of goods. I remember indeed that you have interceded before; but now the letters will be more weighty, whatever is written in the present case, which he will explain to you, to the established court or to our consuls and senate. It remains that you intercede with God for us with constant prayers, as we are exposed to all the arrows of fortune and nowhere is anything safe for us from deadly plots.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly.</p>
      <p>Chur, 1572, April 4, at night.</p>
