      <p>Recently letters have arrived, and the secret ones were received late; note well that it is very difficult for us. May the almighty God have mercy on His own forever.</p>
      <p>It is rumored, among other things, that Granvelle has sent messages to several cities individually and warned them earnestly, that they should not be Zwinglian and should comply with the emperor, etc., with great and impressive insistence. Oh God from heaven, there is fear and distress everywhere.</p>
      <p>The enclosed letter from Augsburg should be handed over and sent to Basel to reach Gastio promptly. Letus sends you many good wishes, and would like the letter to reach Gastio soon. Frau Sch√∂nerin sends you many good wishes, and writes to her brother; he should again be with his old host, Tumysen.</p>
      <p>I will only find out tonight what the fundamental news is, and will report to you promptly. Pray and intercede faithfully for me. I must confess to you that I have now misplaced your letter about the Interim in my study and have thus lost it; should I become senseless, I cannot find it anymore. I have not yet opened it, I will search for it more, although I have searched through everything. It is a wonder upon wonder, it has disappeared from under my hands.</p>
      <p>If there is anything in these letters that I should know, please, I beg you, write again with the next messenger. But behold, I have now found it and give you my greatest thanks. Many good people have bad omens for the French; may the Lord so moderate this gamble of war that the borders of His kingdom of Christ may be extended as widely as possible on this occasion.</p>
      <p>Not a single word about the people of Strasbourg. Farewell well with all yours, to whom I send many greetings from me, and encourage them to intercede constantly for our church. June 8th.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
