      <p>Greetings and peace through Jesus Christ, our Lord, and diligent commendation of my duties and those of my people. I received your two letters, most revered father, almost at the same time in Krak처w. For those sent via Frankfurt were delivered to us a few days before the later ones. From both, I perceived that you are very concerned both about me, for not writing, and about the money, which has not been sent for so long for the necessary use of the boys living with you in Z체rich. I was indeed greatly distressed that our letters, written by me and by the Palatine and by Lord Paul Gilovius long ago, had not been delivered to you, which the Lord Palatine had entrusted to a certain man to deliver after my departure to Lithuania to the king's court. For the Lord Palatine, with some nobles of the kingdom, used me as an intermediary to our king in church matters, which duty I could not neglect for the edification of the church. However, the one who received our letters to be delivered was suddenly struck by a severe illness on the journey and lay sick in Prague, taking no care to send the letters either to Nuremberg or to you.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, since it was agreed with Lord Wolphius that those in Mischkov who live in his house should be separated after a year and placed in other locations, and our Cracovian Palatine had decided to send certain letters of our king and his own through some familiar person to the most illustrious Prince Elector Palatine, and your letters had intervened, from which we could gather that some deliberation was needed about Johann, then also they indicated the diligence and effort of Lord Josias Simler in refuting these blasphemies and settling controversies, which he provides to afflicted churches, then also other matters arose, about which in person. Therefore, our Palatine began to insist and earnestly entreat me with many others, both ministers and nobles of the kingdom, not to be reluctant to undertake a journey to these provinces. This matter was somewhat harder for me, especially at this summer time, but since they insisted so and offered those conveniences for traveling and the prospect of seeing you greatly refreshed me, I allowed myself to be persuaded to undertake this journey and have now arrived safely and unharmed in Nuremberg by the grace of God.</p>
      <p>Passing through Prague, I learned that our letters had been retained there by that sick man with some of his belongings, to my great sorrow and annoyance, which I now send to you without delay, since they are written back by the Palatine to your letters, since by other friends, since they contain not insignificant matters. However, I retained mine out of sadness, the sum and scope of which was this. I indicated that the Palatine was pleased with your benevolence, love, and prompt willingness towards his people and especially towards Johann, so that nothing was more pleasant or gratifying to him than that you received him into your house. And immediately writing to his nephew Johann, he commanded him to conduct himself in such a way that he would not be troublesome to you or yours in any matter but be frugal and obedient. As for the expenses, you should not doubt. I added some things about the political and ecclesiastical state of the kingdom, which I now prefer to report in person. However, I will come to you with Christ as my guide in a few days, for today I am heading straight to Heidelberg. There I will stay for a few days in the court of the most illustrious Prince Elector, then to Strasbourg, finally through Basel to you.</p>
      <p>May God, the best and greatest, grant that I may find and see you all safe and sound. I bring money with me to satisfy all of you, and I bring other things to repay this delay with interest. I ask you to inform Lord Gwalter and Lord Wolphius what happened with our letters, and if possible, do not say anything about my arrival either to the Mischkovians or to my nephew, nor should Gwalter or Wolphius say anything to theirs. It is very necessary and in the interest of both me and them that I come to them unexpectedly. I bring many writings published by the Transylvanian Samosatenians to Lord Simler, whom I greet reverently, and your whole family. I will hasten to be with you as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily, most revered father, and keep me in your love.</p>
      <p>Given in Nuremberg hastily on July 15, 1568. Our Schlisemberger greets you very much.</p>
      <p>Most devoted and most observant of you, Christoph Thretius... to the most illustrious and... man Lord Heinrich Bullinger the elder, most vigilant pastor of the church of Z체rich, most revered lord and father.</p>
      <p>In Z체rich.</p>
