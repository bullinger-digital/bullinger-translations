      <p>Strasbourg, August 2: Count Waldeck has left Guise to join Condé with seven hundred horsemen. Rhingrave asserts that he will not fight against people of his own religion.</p>
      <p>It is reported that Guise is about to besiege Orléans, where Condé is staying. - It is written from Antwerp that the Queen of England is preparing a large army, which she will send to France to aid Condé. The reason for this preparation is said to be that Guise struck the English Queen's envoy. - Andelot has passed through here to the Protestant princes.</p>
      <p>It is believed that he will obtain assistance.</p>
      <p>Letters from Cardinal Lorraine from Paris to the King of Navarre have been intercepted, in which, among many other secrets, it is stated that after a month he does not know where money can be obtained to sustain the war...; that the Queen of Navarre would come to Condé's aid with six thousand foot soldiers. Further, it is written here that Lord Andelot has defeated the papists in Provence and killed them, although Captain Studer from St. Gallen with 14 of his men has perished... The Bernese are moving towards Châlons. Someone has come from Paris, saying that the 15 banners of Frölich have moved near Paris into Guise's camp, thus 1200 black riders and Rogendorf, 20 banners of landsknechts under the Rhingrave, and some say Guise wants to fight or besiege Orléans.</p>
      <p>If it's true, then waiting long is good. There is much talk of many preparations and meetings of the 5 places, Solothurn, etc.</p>
      <p>God grant that something good may come of it.</p>
      <p>And how is it that you write nothing to me about the council? It should be in session and making decisions.</p>
