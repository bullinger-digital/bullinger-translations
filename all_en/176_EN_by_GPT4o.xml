      <p>God's power, grace, counsel, and comfort be with us eternally.</p>
      <p>Dearest lord and brother, I received your letter, as mentioned in my last letter, on the 10th of June. Among other things, you advised me not to accept the untruthful, false, and distorted Interim. Now, the man of blood has earnestly urged my lords of Memmingen to accept it, upon which they sent for me, wanting to know from me whether I would accept it, and if not, to state my reasons and put them in writing. I have now presented this to my brothers, and we have all unanimously agreed not to accept it in any way, having shown our written reasons with the support of divine scriptures and the fathers. Our response has been well received by the common cities alongside other good opinions. We have also appointed a council and community to this end, earnestly admonishing them not to accept the Interim, etc., but I fear little has been achieved thereby. For the consul Funckius is completely despondent, never convinced of the truth, and yet well-spoken, as he has taken another counsel for himself and thereby misled the others with him.</p>
      <p>Therefore, after strict insistence, what happened in Augsburg, along with the given assurance, they have accepted and approved the Interim, God must lament it. Therefore, I now await every day when they will follow it, erecting the shameful abomination and abolishing preaching with me.</p>
      <p>Should this happen, I am completely resolved to come to you and, with your help, comfort, and counsel, to change my affairs, so that what God has granted me temporally, I may direct to a place and further provide for myself and my household with God's help; for I cannot remain with the shameful abomination. Therefore, dearest lord and brother, let me be faithfully commended to you in this my concern; I will owe and deserve it to you and yours, if possible. I have much to write to you; but neither time nor pen can endure it. No more, then may God preserve you and your dear church along with your entire household in all godly steadfastness. Amen.</p>
      <p>Greet your dear wife, all dear lords and brothers for me. Bartholomeus Berthlinus and Joannes Schmyd greet you cordially, etc.</p>
      <p>Given in Memmingen on the 28th of June in the year 1548. Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To his dearest brother M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
