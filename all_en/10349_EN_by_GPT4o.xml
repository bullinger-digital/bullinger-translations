    <p xml:id="regest1">Responds to the complaints from Myconius regarding Zurich's lack of willingness to reconcile with Bern. The Zurich delegates at the last assembly in Baden waited in vain for a friendly sign from the Bernese assembly delegates, which was mediated by Basel and hoped for by the Zurich reformers. Neither Bern nor Basel did anything at the assembly to ease the path to reconciliation for Zurich. Nevertheless, Myconius should not worry about Zurich; Bullinger and the Zurich clergy intend to stand firm in their faith and remain steadfast even in the face of danger. Bullinger hopes for improvement with God's help and asks for Myconius' understanding. Myconius' letter arrived on the day this letter was written. Greetings from Leo Jud.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>What should I write next, venerable brother, when I see that you have completely despaired of us and are more convinced of our defection than can be dispelled by any letters? I had indeed hoped that the matter of reconciliation, which had begun very happily, could be completed even more happily through your efforts, if the Bernese had testified their willingness towards us either by delegation or in writing, as all the pious among us had hoped. But I infer from these your most bitter letters that all hope of the pious in this matter has turned to ashes. So be it, let the will of the Lord be done. That your delegates, most upright men, did not approve of everything, we do not wonder, since not everything is approved by us either, nor are we the only ones in this world where you can find everything most perfect. Certainly, if everything with us were sincere, there would be no need for mediators in mending concord, although I believe they will not fail us even now. For I promise myself better things from yours than you do from ours, who nevertheless diligently instructed the delegates recently sent to Baden to faithfully accept anything offered by the Bernese. But now I hear from you that neither yours nor the Bernese have offered anything. Hence, I do not know in what direction ours will interpret this. This one thing I know, that it is of divine providence and fate inevitable, if any evil, wars, servitude, exile, or destruction should fall upon the wretched, whose every aid and counsel is continually disturbed. However, there is no need for you to be anxious about our faint-heartedness. For whether we must live among these people (whom we cannot judge to be entirely impious for the most part) and preach the word of the gospel, or whether we are to be killed or sent into exile, we will not dissemble, we will watch, as you piously exhort, we will exhort to piety and constancy, we will accuse crimes and the criminal, as the grace of Christ will give and praying will confirm. We can do no more. We commend ourselves entirely to Him, beseeching that He may use our simplicity and weakness to the glory of His name. You too, dearest brother, pray for us and take these things of ours in good part. I hope the Lord Jesus will sometime help us wretched, despised, and trampled upon, whether He grants it abundantly in this world or in the future, which we prefer.</p>
      <p>Farewell, beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 22, 1534.</p>
      <p>On this very day, your letter was delivered to me. Leo wishes you well.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Oswald Myconius, most vigilant and faithful pastor of the Basel church, fellow minister, and especially dear brother.</p>
