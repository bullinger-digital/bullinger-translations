      <p>Greetings. I received, beloved brother, the two booklets you sent.</p>
      <p>I read the one written in Latin very diligently; if our adversaries are not content with these, further efforts will be in vain for the faithful. Do not doubt that it has been fulfilled in Christ. They seem unworthy to me of the peace offered...,... defenders of the antichrist, but I firmly believe that this work of yours has served to strengthen the hearts of many faithful. For I give thanks to my God, who so greatly refreshes me, an old man, through your saving ministry. I will read the booklet written in German with the same diligence with which it was given. Forgive me for interrupting you, overwhelmed with so many and such great tasks. I am moderately well with my family. The prefect of our city, Brandolff, departed to the Lord on the 19th of this month with much constancy of holy faith, not without great joy and sorrow, especially of our entire church; before departing, he bade you farewell through me and wished you all good things. Farewell, greeted by Dolperger, by the widow, your friend. In the next letter, I will write about the prefect of our castle. The messenger hastens his departure.</p>
      <p>Farewell, incomparable friend, and greet yours in my name. Given in Lenzburg, March 20, 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gervasius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the ZÃ¼rich church, old friend and brother in Christ, to be greatly respected.</p>
