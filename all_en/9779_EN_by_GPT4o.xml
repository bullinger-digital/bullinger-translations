      <p>Greetings. Yesterday at nightfall, I received your letters, most esteemed father, from which I learned that all of mine have been delivered to you. However, I do not request either description back from you. Yesterday, I handed letters to a certain student for you. I also heard the rumor about borrowing money, perhaps not without foundation; I will act as if dealing with another matter regarding this with the consul.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly, August 24, 1574, Chur.</p>
      <p>Forgive me; for I could not write more.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, chief minister of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
