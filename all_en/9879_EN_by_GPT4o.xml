      <p>S. D. I give you the greatest thanks, most esteemed father, for sympathizing with my illness along with your colleagues and for commending me to the Lord with your prayers. The illness was as sudden as it was severe, intense, and dangerous. It struck me in the very midst of eagerly reading those writings which you have generously and truly paternally shared. A heaviness in the head and indescribable pains, which frequent cuts and stabs provoked, especially when I was falling asleep, tormented, disturbed, and weakened me so much that upon waking, I could hardly perceive who or where I was until I collected myself. Fevers and chills tormented the rest of my body. I attribute the main cause of the ailment to the grief and indignation of the mind, which I had conceived from the Gr端bel scandal, which the Gr端bel family, evidently agitated by Satan, has not yet allowed to be remedied, indeed, alas, they increase it day by day by piling sins upon sins. However, I have somewhat recovered, although many remnants of the illness remain, which the Lord in His mercy will soon purge, moved by your prayers. I thank you for the document of the Polish kingdom's orders, which I indeed desired in response to Thretius's letter; I now return it. From the draft, as they call it, in which you enclosed the Polish document, I have sufficiently perceived the idea of your entire apology against Schmidelinus.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord that it may bear abundant fruit; however, I do not think I will live long enough to hear that a general synod of our churches has convened, which the late Philip Melanchthon indeed longed for with great desire, but could not see. I hope for the desolation of the Antichrist's kingdom through the Turk, so that the Lord may show an example of His wrath and justice even in this age, and then shortly after, that the Lord Jesus Himself will hold the assembly of the last day. This general or universal synod alone will be beneficial to its own, the rest will be similar to all the ancient ones, even if they were the best.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. My fellow ministers and the rest of your friends send their greetings to you and all your colleagues with me. January 27, 1575.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Johann Konrad Ulmer. To the most illustrious man and exceptional servant of Jesus Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Z端rich, his most esteemed lord and brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>Z端rich.</p>
