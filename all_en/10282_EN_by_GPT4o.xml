    <p xml:id="regest1">Defends against the rumors communicated to him by Myconius about the developments in Zurich: there is absolutely no talk of secret negotiations with France; foreigners and refugees are not being expelled from Zurich; Zurich is also not planning anything detrimental against Bern. Bullinger sends Myconius his book "On the Shameless Outrage of the Anabaptists." Heinrich Lavater remains in Zurich with Bullinger. In Zurich, despite the humiliations suffered, there is no despair, but rather hope in God's help. Bullinger inquires about a way to send money to the two Zurich scholarship holders in Bourges.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Matters have so far prevented me from writing, but now I will respond briefly to each point.</p>
      <p>I see, however, that it is too true what is said in the well-worn proverb, that the most inauspicious things are always told about the unfortunate. We are indeed unfortunate, but not in the matters that are attributed to us. For there is a certain hope that our people will have no dealings with the French.</p>
      <p>Why our messengers, otherwise good men, recently received some crowned ones, and what else was done about this matter, you undoubtedly know. As for what you told about expelling foreigners, exiles, and refugees from the city and countryside, it was begun with a very different intention, which the bearer of this letter will explain. If anything has been initiated by our people against the Bernese, we are all unaware of it, nor do we fear that anything can be initiated. For the whole land, and finally all the citizens, wish better for the Bernese than that the conspiracy of a few (which we do not know) could harm them.</p>
      <p>I am sending our books, written long ago against the Anabaptists with crude skill.</p>
      <p>Regarding Lavater, there is nothing else to expect. He will remain with me for now. Lavater has, however, expressed his gratitude.</p>
      <p>We do not despair; we continually hope for better things by the grace of the Lord. The Lord has humbled us once, He will exalt us again, if it seems good to Him, although we desire no exaltation other than that which would free us from the tyranny of some. But may the will of the Lord be done. Pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 18, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich.</p>
      <p>Dear one, if you have certain news to Burgos in France, let me know; we would like to prepare money for our boys to send to them.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, most vigilant overseer of the church in Basel, brother to be revered in the Lord.</p>
