      <p>Venerable, highly and well-learned sir, I offer you my willing service, etc. in advance. If I do not ride to Lyon this fair, I have instructed and requested our people to buy the 2 pieces of cloth for you at the best and fairest price, one white, the other red. If you want anything further, please let me know, etc. News has reached me that, unfortunately, Famagusta has been conquered; the Turks have raided as far as Vienna, taking away men, women, and children along with grain and wine. Lord Hofmeister... writes from the court at Blois, dated September 27, how the pious Lord Admiral, beloved by the king, his brother, was given 120,000 francs by the king for his house damages, and also many other gentlemen who arrived at the court with him were honored. All this was paid by those from Paris, praise be to the Almighty. It is also reported that the entire court lives in peace and joy, as the House of Guise is absent. Otherwise, I have nothing at this time; I am awaiting letters from Augsburg; I will send them later with Zilli, who departs on the 29th of this month, with God's help. If you need anything in Lyon, they will be willing. Hofmeister M[?] sends you many good wishes, lying here ill, often thinking of you. If God helps him, he will come there sooner; it is pitiful how things are going; they are right, in all things they are judge and party, for God's sake one should help; if the four places of the Lord are protectors, they should also be protectors of the poor. For God's sake, remember them, as I have no doubt. My dear lords, I, with them, the preachers, and Mrs. RÃ¼tlingerin, send you friendly greetings. To Lord Walther and others. God's grace be with us all. Amen. Recently I wrote to you via the young Bachoffen, who gladly set me up with 600 [...]. Praise be to the Lord. May He protect everyone from harm. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant, Hans Liner.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, well-learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the elder, faithful servant of the Christian church in Zurich, my beloved lord in Zurich.</p>
