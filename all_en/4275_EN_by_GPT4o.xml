      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Bullinger, Johannes Wolf sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Often and with great sorrow, I think, Father Bullinger, how much this contention over the Eucharist has hindered the progress of the Gospel. However, at this particular time, these thoughts have been revived in my mind, not least by the unprovoked invectives of Joachim Westphal and the confessions of others of the same faction, which are not so much inept as they are importunate. This pain was further increased by the recently published confession of Tilemann, and as it reached the height of my regard for you, it was easy to accomplish, as you wished, to make that confession of Tilemann into Latin.</p>
      <p>In this task, with what faithfulness and diligence I have regarded the mind and opinion of the writer, you have recognized not only from my letters to Mr. Calvin on this matter but also from the reading of the translation itself.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, since you have sent my copy of this translation to Calvin in Geneva, for whose sake you especially wanted this to be made into Latin, so that another might remain with you, I have sent this very one, written by my own hand, to you. For since you are engaged in ensuring that those who are hindered by ignorance of the language and do not read the German writings of the Lutherans may understand in some way, it is not, as some are persuaded, that all contention between us and them is based on the controversy of the word, and much more that they differ from us not only in doctrine and studies but also with hateful rejection and writings as if with camps and arms: truly, I thought it would be both useful to your purpose and pleasing to you that I should do this. For this writing is of such a kind and manner that from it, those who indeed wish can easily explore not so much the minds as the doctrine of these men; just as those harsh insults and venomous calumnies signify their minds burning with hatred of our teachers, their doctrine is shown to be surrounded by the thickest and densest darkness and to be at variance with itself and discordant with itself by their pronouncements, which are excessively dissonant and absurd and fight against themselves, which both sound minds and sacred letters and the sacraments themselves despise and reject. Since you understand these things much more fully and better than I can either comprehend in thought or express in words, I do not need to recount them. Rather, I beg you, reverend father, to kindly accept this, whatever it is, of my zeal for you and for the republic itself, and to love me, who honors you with the highest regard, as you are accustomed to do.</p>
