      <p>To Paul, the reason for my prolonged silence, Bullinger, was none other than that during this entire time, there was nothing at hand to write about. Indeed, thanks were due to you for sending Curio's elegant and pious work, and for the letters from friends, through which you abundantly informed me about new matters, which finally needed to be returned. However, I thought it best to delay this duty until I had something to write to you myself. Therefore, when I received letters from Sayler, a relative, from Augsburg at this hour, I immediately arranged for mine to be joined with yours, sent by our Conrad, an excellent man and (as I assure myself) not to return to his old ways, to be delivered. Sayler writes, among other things, in these words: "In the last letter from Andorf, it was also written to me how the admiral in England, as well as the mint master, were tried and beheaded in London on March 20th, etc. It is said they left behind fifteen hundred thousand crowns worth and the old king's daughter pregnant. But no other particulars are mentioned, as no one likes to write news because all letters are searched at the passage. A servant of the Fugger is supposed to come from England daily; he will be able to say orally what otherwise should not be written. I am hopeful that he will also bring something regarding religion, which I will inform you of first. This will then also not be withheld from you. Dated in Augsburg, April 10th, 1549."</p>
      <p>He writes to me about the admiral and his master of the mint; what he will submit next will not be hidden from you. About the Emperor, nothing, except that he seems to be preparing gradually against the maritime cities of Germany, which have united with remarkable constancy in retaining piety. May the Lord make a sign of His good will in them and protect our Switzerland; for it is certain that those monstrous eagles with peacock tails are also preparing their claws for this. Therefore, the matter itself will demand that we adhere with great concord.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, April 14th, at the twelfth hour in the afternoon, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the beloved city of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
