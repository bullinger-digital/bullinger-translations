      <p>Greetings and peace of conscience through Christ.</p>
      <p>Especially dear lord and father, I inform you at your request that Herr Michel von Üsigen, pastor in Frauenfeld, has publicly preached that Mary is an intercessor, she has crushed the serpent's head, and whoever does not recognize and call upon her as a helper in all troubles, he considers a heretic. This was heard by two preachers and other credible persons, right after Nicholas' event. Also, on the first Sunday in Lent, one must obtain forgiveness of sins through the intercession of the priest in confession, which is called auricular confession, and whoever does not confess will not be saved. For Christ has indeed taken away sins, as much as was in his power. Furthermore, on the Thursday after Esto Mihi, he publicly said in Heinrich Capeler's house in the upper room: "Here is or stands the man who, although he is small, can cause great misfortune." This was heard by one on our side and the city servant on their side, and it was reported by a seated council of Frauenfeld. But someone excused him and said he only spoke it in jest. Thus, no one inquired further. There is a letter behind the mayor Federlin, which indicates how he, an honest man from Tübingen, led his wife away, etc., written by credible people. Also, the doctor from the Ow spoke to a pious, credible man, saying it was true, he was present at the court when the woman was separated from her husband, she said he had done it to her, that she must follow him, but through his medicine, she was cured again, as she had become hostile to him. What Herr Konrad Schreyvogel has said about him is undoubtedly well known to you. He publicly utters such and other speeches and said to the old church lord on the way from Tobel to Frauenfeld, they have a coat warmer than we from the peace of the land, etc. Also, he did not lead any woman away, they followed him themselves, and he bets he would do it again and no one would prevent it, she was a weaver's or another's wife, etc. How honorably he keeps house with a maid, whom a mass priest keeps in his house through Lent, is well known to many. In summary, he is a shameless, evil man who does little harm to the gospel with his teachings and lavish life, but he incites and agitates the nobles against the preachers wherever he can. However, those who are righteous do not believe him, so frivolous is he in his words, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, dear lord, I thank you for your effort and work on my behalf recently, and if I could repay such and other things with my humble services, I would be ready and willing. With this, I commend myself to your love and fatherly loyalty.</p>
      <p>Given in Frauenfeld, February 27.</p>
      <p>Petrus Rümeli, always your willing servant.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious M. Heinrich Bullinger, his dear lord.</p>
