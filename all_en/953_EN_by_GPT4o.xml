      <p>Greetings. I received the letters you sent me on March 13th in London on the last day of April, from which I clearly understood your enduring and paternal love towards me. I was partly filled with joy because you and your church have regained your former health and glory; however, I am saddened that our letters, written so frequently and diligently, were lost in transit; henceforth, I will more carefully inquire into the reliability of messengers.</p>
      <p>Mr. Butler is also quite amazed at having received such rare letters from me. I have often written about his brother-in-law, who now holds an honorable position at our king's court and defends the cause of Christ most honorably there; no one is more zealous in this cause, nor imparts the word of God more fervently to others. He is one of the four stewards of the royal household. His wife, who was Mr. Butler's sister, passed away a year ago and has gone to heaven; he has now married another pious and religious maiden, born of an honorable family. He sends his regards to Mr. Butler and promises him his full support, should he wish to use it in any matter.</p>
      <p>You will convey this to Mr. Butler. Now, let me return to the course and tenor of your previous letter, so that I may respond to each part individually. First, regarding myself and my family, know this: we are all in good health. During the Pentecost holidays, I was granted the opportunity to visit my homeland and parents for 14 days. I found my father alive, and though not a friend, yet not an enemy of the gospel: I also found my uncle supportive, and my homeland, if you consider the multitude, ready and teachable. We must pray to God to send laborers into His harvest. Having returned to London on the fourteenth day, by royal command, I am setting out tomorrow or the day after to Kent and Essex to Mr. Chancellor of the kingdom, who is now residing in the countryside for various reasons.</p>
      <p>This part of our entire kingdom is greatly troubled by Anabaptist frenzy. May the Lord be present so that we may do good work there. After Easter, when the sermons were concluded, which Mr. Poynet delivered on Friday and I on Wednesday before the king and the council during Lent, it pleased the royal majesty and the council to offer the bishopric of Rochester to Poynet and that of Gloucester to me. I declined mine for many reasons, partly because of the foul and impious form of the oath, which everyone who wishes to undertake the function of the episcopal office is compelled to accept, and partly because of those Aaronic vestments, which are still used in that vocation not only in the use of the sacraments but also in public prayers. All these matters reached the king's ears, and he wished to know why I refused to serve God in such a pious and holy vocation. He understood the reasons I have written so far, which entirely deter me from it.</p>
      <p>On the last Ascension Day, I was summoned to render an account before the whole council, whether I justly and lawfully declined the royal office. The matter was seriously debated with questions. Finally (for the glory of God), the outcome we and all the pious hoped for was achieved in our discussion, but not through me alone, but through God's grace and the promptness and love of the councilors towards God and the purity and sincerity of the nascent church. But you will say, I do not yet know the outcome. It was such that they will keep me free from all stain of superstition and the imposture of the oath.</p>
      <p>Under this condition, I accepted the work assigned to me. Help me, a wretched man, with your prayers, that I may diligently and truly seek the glory of God, lest that little flock, for which Christ died, perish. I will not write much about myself at present, except that your excellence may understand that I am now engaged in the tenth chapter of John for reading in the New Testament, and in the fourth chapter of Zechariah for reading in the Old Testament. I have completed Daniel, Jonah, and his interpreter Nahum.</p>
      <p>Thus I will proceed as I can: indeed, I can do all things through Christ, who strengthens me. If His mercy had not been present with me, I would have often looked back since I began from the plow. I would not have thought that the office of preaching was subject to such great and hard troubles. I received the agreement of Calvin and yours on the supper, the letters in which a gift for your little daughter Rachel, as I call her (for yours and yours are mine), was enclosed, and I responded to each. The book you destined for the royal majesty, along with your letters, was presented by the Marquis of Northampton, a valiant man in the cause of Christ, in my presence. I would have presented it myself, had it not been provided by our laws that no one may bring letters or anything else brought from foreigners to the king unless the councilors are first made aware; and no one dares to violate these laws until the king reaches the gravity of constant age. But as for your letters and book, he received them with the greatest and most gracious mind, not without immense thanks: for he inquired most diligently about your humanity and the safety of your church; moreover, he ordered the Marquis to send a royal gift to you as a token of gratitude. When I understood this, I asked the Marquis to thank His Majesty in your name, and that you would have enough evidence of his gratitude if the king himself worked diligently and piously in the vineyard of Christ; moreover, that you never accept any gift from anyone: finally, that it is decreed by your municipal laws to refuse gifts from princes and all others: but if anything should please to be commended through his letters or mine, this would be most pleasing to you. Then the king ordered that I should greet you in his name and thank you in all respects, beseeching that you remember him in your prayers and commend both him and his kingdom to God. Mr. Cox received yours with the same mind, whom I could not visit for many weeks, being hindered by other serious business. All the earls and marquises I ordered to greet you in your name return your greetings. The Earl of Warwick has been ill for a long time, but by the grace of God, he has recovered and will be present in the council on the next Wednesday. England cannot do without him, to tell the truth: he is a most holy instrument and the boldest of the word of God. May the Lord strengthen him.</p>
      <p>We have many other excellent councilors, the Duke of Somerset, the Marquis of Northampton, and of Dorset. The Archbishop of Canterbury has somewhat (or entirely, I do not know) relented from Lutheranism, weaker than I would wish, nor does he dare, I fear, to assert his opinion in all things. As you advise in your recent letters, to make the bishops my friends; unless I attempted this in every way, provided it is done with a safe and intact conscience, I would gravely sin, and, to tell the truth, there are six or seven who entirely desire and wish to promote the glory of God. I honor and cherish them from the heart.</p>
      <p>Now, as you have piously granted my requests, I earnestly beseech you. If you can obtain from Mr. Froschauer all the works of Zwingli, yours, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Gwalther, Mr. Oecolampadius, Mr. Gwalther in his Library and on Birds, which he is now writing about (as rumor has it), for me at the typographical price, that is, at the price at which he sells to booksellers in white, you would do me a great favor, and when I understand his mind, I will ensure he has the money at the next Frankfurt fair, nor will I request the books unless the price is paid first. I also ask that you greet Mr. Coelius [Secundus] on my behalf, of whom I have been perpetually mindful since I migrated here, although I have not signified this to him by letter; and in your next letters, you would write to me what kind of condition he has in Basel: I know the man to be profoundly learned, whom I would gladly associate with myself, once I have thoroughly understood the condition of my bishopric. Since the goods of this condition were anciently contributed to the edification of the church and the education of children, I would wish both to be restored through me, which can in no way be done unless I am assisted by the support of pious and learned men. I would gladly hear and obey your advice on this matter. Therefore, as soon as possible, you would return my requests through your letters; for I know you to be wise and loving of me, moreover, much foresighted for the future. I do not doubt that the cloth once reached you, Mr. Consul, and Mr. Butler. I ask that your notes on Isaiah, on the books of Kings, and from the beginning of the 13th chapter of the epistle to the Romans to the end be copied for me as soon as possible. I will satisfy the scribe, nor will I be unmindful of Mr. Haller's kindness, who has previously endured so many labors on Isaiah for me. Here you have how you may dedicate your book to the Marquis of Dorset: when I return after 14 days from Mr. Chancellor, I will send the style of the Earl of Warwick and the Marquis of Northampton; then you will receive more and more certain information.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I pray the Lord that you may live prosperously with your whole family and church: and I congratulate you and your daughters on such a happy and holy, I hope, marriage. My wife and Rachel wish you all joy in Christ. You will excuse me to Mr. Butler, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Gwalther, for not writing to them now.</p>
      <p>This faithful messenger will render the serious reasons. You, most esteemed lord and most beloved godfather, will consider kindly and favorably what I have now written with a hurried pen. Within a few days, I will write more. I received your most desired and sweetest letters written on May 17th on June 25th, to which I will respond in my next letters. Live and farewell in Christ for a long and holy time. London, June 29, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted to piety, John Hooper. To the man of remarkable piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most pious leader of the church of Zürich, his lord and most dear godfather.</p>
