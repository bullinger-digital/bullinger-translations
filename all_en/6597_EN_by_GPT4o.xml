      <p>Greetings. Even now, I did not want to send the letters from Mr. von Stetten to you without adding my own, especially since I recently received yours, full of love and duty, indeed, but which did not provide me with the subject and occasion for a longer letter. For you write only that my letters have been delivered to you and you ask that I greet Tresch and Mr. Hugo, whose estranged mind from you you suspect not without reason. For since he is very familiar and frequently associates with those who wish us extinguished and removed, it is not difficult to guess what his disposition towards us is, especially since he does not respond to you when you write. He has a house adjacent to mine; but I have scarcely entered it once or twice in the entire 12 years.</p>
      <p>However, so that I do not give too much weight to suspicions, which often deceive us greatly, I will make an effort to explore his mind towards you from another source and write to you about it.</p>
      <p>Tresch is leaving here today to visit his family, I do not know where, and will meet you on his return; make sure not to let him leave without letters. He instructed me to send you his greetings.</p>
      <p>Farewell and give my regards to Mr. Gwalther, Wolf, and especially to your most delightful family in my words.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, on December 10, 1565.</p>
      <p>Matthias Schenck, yours as his own.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, lord and esteemed friend. To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
