      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, most upright Bullinger, in every way reverend and esteemed. I have understood from your writings delivered to Mr. Haller the calamitous defeat of evangelical truth and the savage rage and cruelty that Charles, the most monstrous wolf, has instituted against the sheep of Christ. He, with the flattering allurements of words, has thus far deceived the overly credulous, but at last, what had been hidden by false pretense, now that he considers all his affairs established, cannot be concealed any longer, and they reveal themselves with great danger to many. Therefore, it will be fitting for us to scorn Satan's assaults and to earnestly beseech the Lord for help in prayer, and to seek out and strive for those things which pertain to repentance, and then, whatever happens, to await with great courage, with solid hope conceived in God's grace, what God wishes to accomplish, who acts wonderfully, who deigns to make us fearless and steadfast, so that, if the sky should fall, we would not be afraid. The Lord has provided a limit to this beast, which it will not surpass. But if God should require us to face danger, then it would be necessary to expend our efforts to restrain this crime. Who would not willingly and with an uplifted and magnanimous heart offer this?</p>
      <p>It is effeminate to dread death for the wicked attempt of the Emperor; he does not know that with his success, he does not respect God's pupil with Satanic pride. But behold, we call upon the Lord with certain confidence; He will be with us, He will not allow such heinous crimes, which he has inflicted on the defenseless common people, to go unpunished. But if the Lord wishes to call us to a part of this business, we are ready in the field, prepared to die rather than to allow this Babylonian beast to rage against us.</p>
      <p>Console Mr. Musculus in his affliction; he will have a place with us. Mr. Haller approached me and I showed him the letters, upon reading which I gave advice that pleased him, and all the learned will work so that our Musculus may become, whom I have always esteemed greatly for his learning and candor, which I seemed to perceive from his writings, although he seemed to approach the sacramental matter too much like Vertumnus (perhaps undeservedly; for it is not mine to judge). But whatever it may be, if he thinks well, for you know we are still tender, we will expend diligent effort, which you will soon feel, as I trust, has not been in vain.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, greet Mr. Musculus and all the brothers in my name, whom I wish all to be whole, and let us all gird ourselves to the cross of Christ, which, when we have thrust it into the jaws of Satan, vanishes completely to nothing.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Hastily.</p>
      <p>Given on the 9th of July in the year 48.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant and upright man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and patron.</p>
