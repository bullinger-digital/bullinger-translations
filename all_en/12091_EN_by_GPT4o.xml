    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's letter together with the [Cologne] Reformation book ["Einfaltigs bedencken"] from Blarer's brother-in-law [Heinrich von Ulm]; however, he could not read much from it yet; believes that its authors would have arranged everything more purely if this had been allowed by the injustice of the times and their negotiation partners, as well as by the prince [Archbishop Hermann von Wied]; otherwise, it is very much to be wished that everything is reformed as seriously as possible from the very beginning; yet the state of the church is no longer that of the newly founded church, which relied [merely] on the word of the Lord (even if this sometimes requires interpretation); consequently, it is not inappropriate if initially many things are only [partially improved] until people become better. Blarer also wishes Philipp [Melanchthon] all the best; but what hatred would he incur if he were to go to Zurich or if it were even known that he intended to leave Wittenberg! Bucer has told Blarer about his letters to Bullinger and implored Blarer to help him extinguish the newly kindled fire; which Blarer would gladly do for Christ's sake alone. Blarer does not possess Luther's ["Kurtz bekentnis"]; it pains him that Bullinger suspects him of concealment - especially since a printed work would inevitably come into Bullinger's hands; he would acquire the booklet for Bullinger at any cost and has written to Augsburg about it. [Enclosure:] Blarer does not know exactly the claims of the Württemberg Duke [Ulrich] on [Schwäbisch] Gmünd and even less those on Esslingen; [in the latter case] it was about hunting spoils; but now [Duke Ulrich] has again taken four citizens prisoner for reasons unknown to Blarer. Blarer has already written to Bullinger that the people of Gmünd had captured a nobleman [Hans Christoph von Absberg] and [the Duke] demanded his release at the very place where they had seized him; but the people of Gmünd argued that they held jurisdiction over the place of capture and that furthermore the Emperor had ordered them to hold the prisoner until the satisfaction of the Nurembergers (whose enemy he was); since they did not comply with the Duke's wish, he took ten or twelve [Gmünd] citizens prisoner: another item for discussion at the upcoming city council. Duke Ulrich has conceded the Königsbronn Monastery, over which he was patron, to King [Ferdinand I.], so that it now, along with the associated villages, becomes [Catholic] again; it is a great pity, although the allies [of the Schmalkaldic League] have agreed to it; if this claim is justified, many other monasteries will suffer a similar fate. [King Francis I.] despises the Confederates; as he is old, his power is waning, and his sons [Henry and Charles] are now much involved [in politics]; the Confederates are said to have written to [Francis I.] to find out where they stand with him. Greetings to [Diethelm] Röist.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I received the Reformation book from my brother-in-law along with your letters, my venerable brother, but I can say little about it because I have neither read it entirely nor the good part of it. I believe the authors themselves would have arranged everything more purely if it had been allowed by the injustice of the times and the people they had to deal with, as well as by the elector himself. Otherwise, it is very much to be wished that everything is reformed as sincerely as possible from the very beginning in such matters, since experience has taught us more than once that success is not very fortunate whenever we try to introduce any kind of darkness into such a great light of truth. Our situation now is very different from what it was in the early days of the church, which relied on the confessed word of the Lord, even though it was not yet explained from the veils of figures, and therefore many things were simulated and dissimulated not without significant benefit until they could rise to more perfect things.</p>
      <p>However, it is now also appropriate to interpret this in a good way for those who would like to, but cannot, due to various obstacles, strive directly for the solid establishment of churches.</p>
      <p>I wish for Philipp the same as you do with all my heart. But, O Christ the Savior, how much hatred would he incur if he were to be brought to accept a condition worthy of him there! I know there will be others who will offer him ample salaries if they find out he has decided to leave W[ittenberg].</p>
      <p>Bucer himself wrote to me about his letters to you, imploring and beseeching me in the meantime to be diligent in extinguishing the fire that has arisen again; which indeed I would gladly do for the sake of Christ and the church itself, if I could find any means to do so.</p>
      <p>I have no doubt that Bucer seeks the glory of Christ and the propagation of His kingdom uniquely, so much should be given to such an excellent instrument of Christ.</p>
      <p>As Christ loves and saves me, neither I nor anyone here, as far as I know, has Luther's booklet, and it pains me greatly that I could come into your suspicion of concealing anything from you in this matter. Why would I do that, my Bullinger? It cannot be that what is printed here will not eventually come into your hands, as it is published everywhere. How much better it would be if this were done in a timely manner! I would indeed buy the booklet for this reason alone, so that I could send it to you as soon as possible; which I solemnly promise to do as soon as I obtain it. I have written to Augsburg to receive it from there.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus preserve you. December 5, 1544.</p>
      <p>As for the claims of the Duke of Württemberg on Gmünd and Esslingen, I cannot know thoroughly, especially regarding Esslingen. The first claim was about the game, but he has since returned it to them as before; now, however, he has again taken four citizens prisoner; for what reasons, I have not yet heard specifically.</p>
      <p>Regarding Gmünd, I had written to you before, as I thought they had captured a nobleman in his forest; he wanted them to release him and place him in the footsteps where they had captured him.</p>
      <p>But the people of Gmünd have the high court in those places where this capture occurred; they believe they have the right, especially since the Emperor has ordered them to hold the mentioned nobleman and not release him until the satisfaction of those from Nuremberg (whose enemy he is). Since they do not want to release the nobleman at the Duke's request, he has taken 10 or 12 citizens prisoner.</p>
      <p>This will also be discussed at the next city council, etc. Duke Ulrich has now conceded a monastery to the king again, over which he has always been the protector; it is called Königsbronn, over which he has had all administration according to his income and acted as in other monasteries. Now the monastery, along with the associated villages, must become Catholic again. It is a great pity, although the allies of the Protestants have recognized that he should do it, since it is found that this monastery has always been included in the imperial arrangements. But if this is to be a sufficient claim, then many other monasteries will have to be given up, which they have taken. In summary: The matter begins to falter everywhere, and it is to be feared that there is little courage and heart among all, etc.</p>
      <p>Also, it is said that the Frenchman is not at all satisfied with the Confederates; he has despised some, calling them beggars; for it is said that the old king is no longer so powerful, the two young ones take much upon themselves, and it is said that the Confederates have written to the king and want to know how they stand with him. What is true about this, time will reveal, and you will now know well; I would also like to be informed.</p>
      <p>To my gracious Lord Röist, please convey many services, greetings, and good wishes from me.</p>
      <p>To the very distinguished man of great piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his much respected and dearest brother.</p>
