      <p>S. P. There is no doubt that the news of the troubles in our England has finally reached you as well, most kind Bullinger. Since such news is often uncertain and inconsistent, I decided to write something certain about the demands of the rebels, the cause of the tumult, and the punishment and penalty they received, which they deserved. The western part of England, which is divided into Cornwall and Devonshire, had rebels gathered in the past months of June and July, numbering, it is believed, sixteen thousand armed men. The leaders of the rebellion initially proposed to the people the attainment of freedom from the injury and oppression of the nobles, who partly by force, partly by deceit, converted common pastures to their own use. And for this reason, the rebellion prevailed throughout all parts of England, so much so that there was almost no part where some were not rioting for this reason. But by royal letters and promises, the peasants were immediately pacified everywhere, except in the aforementioned parts of Cornwall and Devonshire. There, since the instigators of the rebellion were two priests, they immediately warned the common people that religion was in danger, and it was agreed that Christians were ready to defend and restore it. Therefore, in the name and authority of Christ and the king, they gathered a large number of papists. The king wrote to them, admonishing them as a father, to desist from the tumult they had begun. I am sending a book to Butler, which he could explain to you. They despised the admonition and began to openly profess that they wanted to establish another king, another council, another religion, as is evident from these articles translated into Latin.</p>
      <p>The king, now compelled, attacked the enemies with a just army; three or four thousand were slain: the city besieged by them, called Exeter, was liberated: several instigators of the rebellion were captured, the rest were all dispersed. There are still rebels in another part of England, who, relying on the help of the aforementioned, were causing a tumult.</p>
      <p>Against these, the protector of the kingdom himself set out at the beginning of this month with a large number of soldiers. Therefore, I hope they received a punishment worthy of the rebellion. Meanwhile, while these things are happening in England, the tyrant of the French rather than the state (for it is not unknown to you how he recently raged with tyranny against Christians in Paris, while a procession was being received into the city, how he ordered five to be miserably burned as a spectacle and game) declared war on our king and kingdom, but first prepared soldiers by sea, who immediately after the declaration of war would invade western England and join the rebels. But the Lord prevented this evil; for when it was announced to us that the French had landed and set up an army on land, they hastened there, seized the approaches to the ships, prepared for battle, and there the entire army of the French was laid low, so much so that, as it was written to me by a trustworthy source, not one was left alive. The number of the French is estimated to have been five or at least four thousand.</p>
      <p>This is what I had to inform you about our England at present. Moreover, there is a rumor that all the Swiss have accepted an alliance with this monstrous tyrant of the French; when I asked the author whether the people of Zurich had also agreed to this alliance, he affirmed it. But I cannot believe that your people are so insane as to have accepted an alliance with this tyrant, who seeks nothing but to establish the pope and his kingdom. I wish to know the truth of the matter from you. Mr. Richard and his wife send their warmest greetings to you and your wife, who wrote almost all of this to me. My wife also greets you very respectfully. Pray for us and our England to the Lord. Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, John Burcher.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher, residing in front of the Minster, my kind lord and good friend. Zurich.</p>
