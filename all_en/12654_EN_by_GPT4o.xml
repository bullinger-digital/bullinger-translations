The following night, a man named [Pantaleon Ebner from Lindau] attempted to murder Captain Sebastian Schertlin. The latter defended himself bravely, and the perpetrator was arrested. He confessed to being hired for 3000 guilders by a [Wolfgang Kantz from Bregenz] to carry out the attack.

      <p>Grace and peace. On Tuesday, the past 28th of September, our forces once again won a skirmish against the Emperor, killing about 60 and capturing several. The following night, a murderer attempted to kill Captain Sebastian Schertlin between 1 and 2 o'clock while he was inspecting the watch. However, God protected him, and he defended himself so valiantly that the murderous traitor was captured. He confessed that if he had succeeded in killing him, he would have been given 3000 guilders. On the 1st of October, he was brought to justice. It is also reported that a captain among our forces in Donauwörth is also a traitor; you will soon hear about this. I have always greatly feared treachery; however, this will open their eyes.</p>

      <p>On the 29th of September, the troops of Oldenburg captured an Italian captain, drove away his servants, of whom 9 were stabbed, captured 3 Bohemians, and one poorly dressed fellow; however, he had 100 crowns with him. It is suspected that he is a spy and one of the right-hand men.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Our forces captured a scout in the Emperor's camp. He reported (as the prisoners also confessed) that things are very expensive in the Emperor's camp: bread, which costs 9 denarii with us, costs 6 kreuzers with them; wine, which costs 4 kreuzers with us, costs 7 kreuzers with them. The scout counted 52 people being buried in one day.</p>

      <p>The Emperor wanted to take Kaisheim (an Imperial Abbey), but the Landgrave preempted him.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Thus, the Emperor is said to have crossed the Danube with all his forces to the other camp in Marxheim, in the land of Bavaria. It is suspected that he will move south. He has summoned the Franconian nobility with their horses.</p>

      <p>I have other things to write to you. This is the most important. More soon. Strange things are happening between the Empire, France, England, etc., against the Emperor. May God turn it to our favor!</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>You write so little that it surprises me. The last was on the 2nd of October. Dear friend, tell me, have you received the large letter belonging to Francisco Dryander? Greet him faithfully for me.</p>

      <p>The poor people of Neuburg are not being given what was promised to them. It is pitiful. God will find a way.</p>

      <p>Greetings to Gastius; let him not be unaware of these things.</p>
