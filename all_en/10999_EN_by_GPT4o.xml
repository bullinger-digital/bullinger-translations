      <p>My friendly, willing service and whatever I can do in honor and goodness beforehand, honorable, well-learned, especially gracious, dear sir.</p>
      <p>As the honorable Mr. Johannes Cervinus from Bergell assures some subjects in Lengnau with the divine word and always (each time) goes to them from Zurich once every fourteen days, while the subjects are very few and must support (pay) him at their own expense, which is too difficult and not feasible for them, they have asked me to intercede with my gracious lords of Zurich, so that they may provide him with some support and assistance, so that he may remain with them and proclaim the divine word. And since I do not find it necessary to trouble my lords about this, I do not doubt that once you have been informed, you will assist in such support, as now, as mentioned, the subjects are few and it is not within their means to support him at their own expense, and I do not doubt that if he could stay with them, he would bring much benefit and Christian discipline to the glory of God among them, and the faith would be greatly increased among them. Therefore, it is my diligent, friendly request to you, that you may urge my gracious lords of Zurich or those who are set over the monastery goods, and also ask them on my behalf, that they may extend their assistance to the good poor man, so that he may remain with them and they may not be entirely deprived of the divine word. I desire to earn this from you willingly at all times.</p>
      <p>Herewith, I commend you to Almighty God in long-lasting health faithfully.</p>
      <p>Dated the last day of February in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>Your willing</p>
      <p>Benedict Sch√ºtz from Bern, bailiff in Baden.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the city of Zurich, my special, gracious lord.</p>
