      <p>From Marburg in Hesse, January 27, 1566.</p>
      <p>Our gracious prince and lord has also sent his foremost advisors to the Imperial Diet in Augsburg: Doctor Schaeffer, the chancellor, Doctor Lerßner, the chief magistrate of Schönstatt, and the governor at the Wher, with 27 horses. In their first letter, they informed our gracious prince and lord that His Imperial Majesty has arrived in Augsburg very strongly and splendidly, intending to accomplish much good in matters of religion and other affairs. However, it is well known that the Turkish emperor is preparing so fiercely and strongly that no one has ever heard the like. Therefore, the Imperial Diet will soon conclude, and a common campaign by all German princes against the Turks will have to be organized. This was the entire content of their letter from Augsburg.</p>
