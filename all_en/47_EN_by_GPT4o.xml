    <p xml:id="regest1">Had Myconius known that Bullinger was prevented from responding due to his engagements, he would not have mentioned his silence so often. Although he is aware of Bullinger's obligations, he still feared another reason for the lack of responses to his last three letters [hbbw XX, No. 3100; 18012. 18027]. But after Bullinger's letter [18032], Myconius is now completely satisfied and grateful!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Particularly pleasing is the harmony among the Swiss Confederates mentioned by Bullinger during the last Diet [on January 23, 1548]. If this remains so, no one, neither out of a desire for fame nor a lust for war, will be able to harm the Confederation. This is also the reason why the bloodthirsty Emperor Charles V wants to sow discord among the Confederates. And Bullinger knows how long he has been trying this! May God protect the Confederation as before!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Bullinger's news about Jodocus von Meggen and the Lucerners, who, of all times during the current turmoil, comply with the requests of Pope Paul III [to revive the Swiss Guard], astonishes Myconius. Can Charles V not deduce from this what kind of sentiment prevails against him? Unless he has conspired with the Pope for the downfall of the Confederates... Myconius does not understand how [the mercenaries] intend to reach Italy without crossing Venetian territory. If only he could warn them to be cautious!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Today he heard that twelve unknown Baslers [N.N.] have set off without the council's permission [to join Meggen's troop]. If only all remaining Basler Papists would follow them! The Baslers would have it easier if [in the event of an attack by the Emperor] a conflict [between the confessions] were to arise. But may God spare them from this in His mercy!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">A letter from someone confirms (without naming names) Myconius's fears: King Henry II of France will, if the opportunity arises, ally with the Emperor, should the Confederates reject [the extension of the pay alliance]. If this happens, [Charles V.] will easily conquer the Confederation. He only needs to cut them off from salt! Had it not been for King Louis XII of France during the Swabian War, the Confederates would have been defeated due to a lack of salt. What does Bullinger think of these rather human considerations?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Greetings, also to Bullinger's family and his colleagues.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I would not have mentioned your silence so often if I had known for certain that you were prevented from responding due to your engagements. Not that I am unaware of your cares and labors. I feared there might be another reason for your lack of response to my last three letters. But now, good God, how abundantly you have satisfied me! I desire nothing more and give you my greatest thanks.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>It is particularly pleasing what you write about the harmony in the recent Diet. For it seems to me that as long as this remains, no one, however glorious and fierce, can harm us. This is also the reason why the bloodthirsty Emperor Charles V seeks nothing among us but discord. You know how long he has desired and attempted this! May the Lord protect us as He has done so far and continue to do so, we pray.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I am astonished at what you signify about Jodocus von Meggen and the Lucerners, that they comply with the Pope's requests, especially in these tumultuous times. Can the Emperor not understand from this what their sentiment is towards him, unless perhaps the Pope and he are conspiring to our ruin? I do not know how they intend to reach Italy unless through Venetian territory. I could warn them to be cautious!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Today I hear that 12 have set off from our city without the council's permission, none of whom I know. If only all the Papists we still have would be compelled to follow. We would be better off if any afflictions were to occur, which the Lord may graciously avert.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Concerning the French, I fear that if we do not agree with them, they may incline towards the Emperor. For someone writes under a suppressed name these words: "To whom great opportunities for peace and alliance are offered, let him not reject them if you reject his friendship." If this happens, he will easily conquer us. Only salt prevents it. In the Swabian War, if it had not been for the French, we would have been defeated due to a lack of salt. Please tell me, at your leisure, what you think. All that I consider is according to human reasoning.</p>

      <p>Farewell in Christ with your family. Greet all the most holy brothers in the Lord. Basel, February 18, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed brother and lord in Christ.</p>
