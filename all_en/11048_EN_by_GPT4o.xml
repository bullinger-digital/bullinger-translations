      <p>My friendly greetings and all the best beforehand.</p>
      <p>Dear sir, I have understood (heard, learned) how you have shown so much goodness to my sons and especially now to my son Hector in his needs and concerns. For this, I thank you most highly for all the good you have ever shown them, and I kindly ask you to continue to be helpful and advisory to them, especially to my son Hector now in his needs and concerns. I will always strive, along with my sons, to deserve this from you, willingly found with our body and goods.</p>
      <p>Dated Constance, on the fourteenth day of June in the year etc. in the 37th.</p>
      <p>Your wisdom always</p>
      <p>Jörg Göldin, citizen of Constance.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear and good friend, to be delivered.</p>
