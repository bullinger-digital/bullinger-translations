      <p>S. D. What you sent me on November 11, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, I, as you love me, received the day before yesterday, that is, on the eighth of this month, and I might have received it much later, if not for the servant of our pharmacist, who was in Neuchâtel these days, had brought it here, which I regret because I could not send those articles, truly worthy of the Council of Trent, to Bern to your venerable godparents, as you requested. However, I will now ensure they are delivered to them through this seemingly trustworthy woman, Katharina Lindiger, through whom I also wrote to you on October 29, as she is leaving for Bern today with her husband. I also recently sent you a letter through Jacob Engel, your apparitor, on November 15, in which you clearly understand that my later letters are in response to your writings of November 11, and there is no reason for you to justly complain about my negligence in writing, although the fact that I very rarely encounter those who travel directly from here to you and that I never learn anything here that you do not already know there, entirely deters me from writing to you often, rather expecting you to write to me more frequently. Even the writings from Augsburg I receive too late to think they would reach your knowledge beforehand, especially since I also constantly miss the couriers who hasten their journey to you, who would deliver to you as soon as possible what I receive untimely, and thus the delay in delivery is doubled; otherwise, I would not allow you to justly demand anything from my former diligence in writing.</p>
      <p>For your letters and articles, especially your Antithesis, I owe you uncommon gratitude, and indeed regarding those articles, it is not surprising that the pillars of the Roman Church remain perpetually the same and that the Cretans say and decide everything from the abundance of their hearts. This idol is for them the prow and stern in their falsely claimed ship of Peter; if they allowed it to be taken from them, they would be shipwrecked in a pitiable manner. Therefore, they will fight as if for their altars and hearths for such a profitable merchandise. As for the fact that they hurl so many of their thunderbolts at us and with such confidence and authority devote our heads to curses, they do this according to their custom. But we will be consoled by what is written: "They will curse, and you will bless," and: "He loved cursing, and it came to him."</p>
      <p>The cat's prayer does not reach heaven. They will fall into the pit they have made. When your Antithesis was brought, by chance a pious French brother was present, who ministers to a church of Christ in our field; he asked to have the opportunity to read it, promising to return it to me in good faith after two days. I now eagerly expect him to fulfill his promise, and I do not doubt that he will keep his word, for if I had not been obliged to serve a not insignificant necessity at this time, he would have obtained nothing from me, and I would have been the first to read it. Pray for us and for the endangered church of Christ. Let us urge repentance, without which there is no reason to expect any salvation from the Lord. Farewell, my venerable and dearest soul, and love me steadfastly. Greet the church in your house; greet your ministers in the Lord, especially Mr. Pellican, Theodor, and Gwalther, Wolff, Werdmüller, Zwingli, Lavater, and the others. Greet our dear Butler and his wife very carefully. We fervently wish to be commended to the Savior Christ by the patronage of all of them. Those whom you ordered to be greeted by your words greet you as honorably as they can. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Biel, December 9, 1551.</p>
      <p>Many fine servants passed through here last Sunday, and it was said they were all from Zurich. Captain Frölich publicly announced in Solothurn that he would have no Bernese among the servants, and if he found one, even if they had just arrived, he would send him back; but the people of Zurich were dear to him, etc. It is also publicly said that in the coming spring, if the war begins, several thousand Zurichers will march. This would not be against their authorities, although they do not openly allow it; for they do not dare to do so before the preachers. But they will turn a blind eye and then make a good agreement when they return. If this is true, I am sorry.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his especially dear lord, to his hands.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
