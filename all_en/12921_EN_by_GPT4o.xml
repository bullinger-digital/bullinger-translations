    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Even though the two letters [HBBW XIX, No. 2855 and 2859] from Myconius do not require a response, Bullinger at least wants to inform that they have been received well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Myconius found it amusing that in a letter addressed to him [HBBW XIX, No. 2850], he was asked to recount its content to himself. Surely, this is a clear sign of Bullinger's work overload! In return, Bullinger can also laugh at Myconius, especially since he dated his last letter [HBBW XIX, No. 2859] to the "44th" of March, as if he were living in the first century, where according to some [ancient authors] the months were longer and the days shorter. The letter was, of course, from the 24th of March. How quickly such mistakes can happen!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger can hardly imagine that Landgrave Philipp of Hesse is up to something evil. Of course, one can be mistaken about princes and people in general. However, Bullinger's friend Johannes Pistorius shared something confidential with him in a letter [HBBW XIX, No. 2815] that gives reason for hope.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The ship from India [= America] fires the imagination! What does Emperor Charles V have to do with the Indians? Such tales are invented by those merchants who fall to their knees before this half-decayed corpse! It seems much more plausible that the ships are bringing in nothing but plagues.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger fears that Strasbourg has surrendered, but he is waiting for a corresponding message from Myconius.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Bullinger was forced to take in the recommended Englishman [John Hooper] into his house, as it was not easy to find suitable accommodation for him. Bullinger writes "forced," but he gladly took him in, especially since [Hooper] seems to be a sincere person. He will probably stay with Hans J채ckli, the former mayor, who is now the chamberlain of the Grossm체nster chapter. He used to live opposite Myconius and now lives in the house called "zum Engel," opposite Zwingli's former residence. The Hoopers will probably not move before Easter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Vadian reported on March 28 [with HBBW XIX, No. 2864] about a letter from Nuremberg, stating that the troops of Duke Maurice of Saxony, after the defeat at Rochlitz, were again defeated at another location with a loss of 8000 horsemen and foot soldiers, that the troops of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony have occupied Bamberg, and that the Elector is advancing with a well-equipped army against the imperial forces. So much for Vadian. If only that were true!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Myconius is recommended these two young Zurichers. One, [Johannes], is the promising son of [Heinrich] Buchter. He and [Markus W체st] will likely stay with [Konrad Wolfhart], the host of Josias Simler. If necessary, Myconius should admonish them fatherly.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have received the letters from your kindness, to which I have not yet responded. And although there is nothing in them that requires a response, I wanted to at least inform you that they have been delivered to me in good faith.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>You joke and laugh because, when writing to Myconius, I instructed Myconius to tell Myconius what I had said to Myconius. But from this, you can gather how entangled I am in many and various affairs. But what should I say about you? Shouldn't I also laugh when I read that your last letter is dated the 44th of March, undoubtedly in some year of the first century, in which some believe the months were longer and the days shorter. But I recognize the error and know that 44 was written instead of the 24th of March. And indeed, such a slip is easy in matters of this kind.</p>

      <p>I have not yet pronounced on Hesse. For I can hardly believe that man harbors any monstrosity. But if my hope deceives me, no prince or man will deceive me as long as I live. Johannes Pistorius, my close friend, wrote some things under the promise of silence, from which I have begun to hope well again. May the Lord repair what is lacking in us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Indian ship seems to have brought abundant material for storytelling (for I will not say lying). For what business does Charles have with the Indians? But such magnificent tales are invented by merchants who worship Charles, a decaying corpse. I would rather believe that many plagues were brought by the Indian ships!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I fear that Strasbourg has surrendered, but I am waiting for your letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I was forced to take in the Englishman recommended by you into my house. For he found it difficult to find a suitable host. However, I say "forced" as a phrase; for I gladly and sincerely took him in, as he seems to be sincere. He will probably find a host in Hans J채ckli, who acts as the city's mayor and is now the chamberlain of our college, formerly your neighbor across the street. He now resides in the house of St. Angel, opposite the house of the blessed memory of Zwingli. But they will not move to him before the festival.</p>

      <p>On March 28, Vadian sent me these words verbatim: "Our people received letters from Nuremberg, which indicate that after the defeat at Rochlitz, Maurice's troops were again defeated in another place with a loss of eight thousand horsemen and foot soldiers. They also report that Bamberg was occupied by the Elector's troops. It is certain that the Elector, with a well-equipped army, will attack the Emperor's army, however large it may be." So much for him. I wish it were true, but I very much doubt its truth!</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I commend these young men from Zurich to you. One is the son of Buchter, a young man of great promise. They will probably stay with Josias's host. Therefore, if you see them err in any way, admonish them as if they were your sons, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Farewell. Zurich, April 4, 1547.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Oswald Myconius, my esteemed brother and lord. Basel.</p>
