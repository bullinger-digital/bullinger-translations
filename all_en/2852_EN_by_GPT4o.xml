      <p> Greetings. Regarding excommunication, about which you wrote to me, I write nothing; this matter cannot be explained in a few words. As long as I live and God does not take away His grace from me, I will look to those things which are of peace and edification in the church, so that nothing is established by me from which infinite evils arise, and thus a much more abundant harvest of dissensions and tyranny of hypocritical men than of union and integrity. I recently sent you a copy of my Summary or Compendium written on true religion. This book has been translated, albeit somewhat, into the Latin language. Now I submit to your piety an Apologetic exposition, which I opposed to the books of Westphal, Timann, and other Saxons. I beg your kindness, that if anything in these my writings displeases you, you may freely indicate it. I cannot say more at present. Let us pray to the Lord diligently, that He may unite distracted minds and preserve all things tending towards utter ruin by His power. </p>
      <p> I seem to see a great judgment of God impending over us. Men do not want to be healed by remedies; I fear that iron and fire must be applied by the Lord. Let us watch and pray. Farewell with all yours, whom you will greet diligently. </p>
      <p> Zurich, March 9, 1556. </p>
      <p> Your Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, faithful minister of the church in Biel/Bienne, esteemed lord and dearest brother. Biel. </p>
