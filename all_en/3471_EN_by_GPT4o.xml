      <p>S. D. Calvino.</p>
      <p>May Christ make this year entirely the most fortunate for us. I congratulate you on the renewed covenant and the old friendship restored with neighbors and old friends. It was rightly advised that it is wiser to retain neighbors and old friends than to wish to acquire new ones from afar, neglecting the former. Indeed, this was also taught to us by the colloquy at Worms.</p>
      <p>It will be better to retain our initiated friendship and sincere agreement than to seek a new one with those who not only disregard our friendship but also condemn us as enemies.</p>
      <p>You know the colloquy is finished.</p>
      <p>You know we are condemned.</p>
      <p>Initially, indeed, by those furious Saxons, who, having been offered the presidency of the condemnation of our churches, left their colleagues and returned home right from the beginning of the colloquy. They specifically condemned Zwingli by name, and specifically associated him with Osiander, Schwenckfeld, etc. The more moderate ones, like Philipp Melanchthon, Johannes Brenz, Jakob Andreae, Pistorius, Diller, and others, initially opposed their colleagues and thought it unjust to condemn without hearing.</p>
      <p>Soon, however, when they saw the colloquy stalling and unwilling to progress, on October 21st, having also offered a protest to the president, they specifically condemned Zwingli, and indeed him alone: they did not specifically mention the others, because Brenz favors Osiander, and Philipp is easily influenced by others. We now have Philipp's declaration of what he currently thinks about the Eucharist.</p>
      <p>If you have not yet seen that protest, we will send it to you. After that protest was offered, the papists in the colloquy were more obstinate than before and did not want to progress (or perhaps they did?). For they had what they wanted (and sought). Until now, in so many assemblies, it could not be obtained from the evangelical princes that they would specifically want to condemn Zwingli. But now the learned ones of the princes, perhaps less circumspect, have given this as accomplished.</p>
      <p>Nor were they content with this.</p>
      <p>For before they left Worms, they declared in a written agreement that they would not change nor ever change what they once professed in the Augsburg Confession. And this is what I have often said: if one meets a thousand times in colloquy with these people, the rule and formula of agreement will be the Augsburg Confession, to which whoever does not subscribe will remain excluded. They have now confirmed this with a published writing.</p>
      <p>Let us therefore love each other mutually: let us also profess what we know to be true, leaving to them what they absolutely want to be left to themselves and insist on keeping untouched. The Lord will not forsake us.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich, January 12, 1558.</p>
