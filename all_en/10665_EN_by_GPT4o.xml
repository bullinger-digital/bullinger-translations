    <p xml:id="regest1">Vadian expects his documents back. Vogler shares some confidential news that reached Vadian: The Bishop of Constance is said to have bought the Abbey of Reichenau. King [Francis I] intends to march against Milan and has therefore written to German captains - among them [Albrecht Völker] of Knöringen. Also, three imperial regiments, under [Franz von Hembstedt], [Konrad von] Boyneburg, and Kaspar von Frundsberg, are set to depart somewhere. Princes and cities are meeting in Kassel. There is talk of the machinations of the Five Places. In Regensburg, city representatives are gathered. It is said that in Lucerne, where an imperial delegation had stayed, preparations are being made, and the Five Places are meeting in Brunnen. In Appenzell, unrest has arisen around Ammann [Ulrich] Eisenhut because he allegedly resold a previously captured banner back to St. Gallen and used the national seal outside the country; at the planned Landsgemeinde, other Swiss places should participate to prevent bloodshed. Vogler will probably come to Zurich only in the fall. [Jakob] Rordorf should give any messages to the messenger.</p>

      <p>God watch over us. Amen etc.</p>
      <p>My lord, beloved brother, knowing of our well-being, and that we truly long for you etc. Recently I wrote to you, enclosing some letters that my lord and father, Doctor from Wadt, gave me to send to you, with the request to send them back by this messenger (although he might perhaps fetch them himself) etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my lord doctor has once again faithfully noted down some articles, written in confidence and secrecy, for you to transcribe and understand:</p>
      <p>Item, that the Bishop of Constance is said to have bought Reichenau, but those from Constance do not want to tolerate it. They do not want to give up any part of their undertaking. It is to be feared that it will cause unrest.</p>
      <p>Item, that the royal majesty of France intends to invade Milan before winter. Therefore, he has written to several captains in Germany. Melchior von Knöringen is to be in Lyon on the 18th of August.</p>
      <p>Item, that shortly three imperial regiments are to set out in the empire, imperial etc. One is to be led by the lord of Thamis, the other by the lord of Bomelberg, and the third by Lord Kaspar von Frundsberg. They are to be used in unusual places and have wonderful practices at hand.</p>
      <p>Item, that princes and cities are not meeting in vain in Kassel; they are tasting the dishes that are present.</p>
      <p>Item, that there is much talk of the practices of the Five Places, therefore the evangelical cities in the Confederation also have to look out for themselves.</p>
      <p>From Nuremberg it is said: Item, that the cities are excellently gathered in Regensburg, shooting-wise.</p>
      <p>Someone said: Item, that in Lucerne weapons and armor have been ordered and the Five Places are meeting in Brunnen. Item, an imperial delegation is also said to have been in Lucerne.</p>
      <p>This you should and may report to my dear lord mayor Rösten of my oath and from you, as answered by my lord doctor, also to him the following: Unrest is present in the land of Appenzell. Namely, a significant unrest and concern from some about Ammann Eisenhut and others because of the city banner of St. Gallen, as if they had won it before, and recently through Eisenhut and some of the city of St. Gallen handed it back. Likewise, concerning the seal, that Ammann Eisenhut should carry it from the land, after the abbot, to seal in St. Gallen in the court; that he should have sealed in the land and not carried it away. Many many pretexts. Yet yesterday Wednesday there was a long great council. Ammann Eisenhut stood there, expecting justice against the restless party. It did not succeed, then simply a Landsgemeinde from next Sunday over eight days to have it, although it is a pity for many. And concern thereby, that perhaps many will rise up, especially individuals, among them in battles or worse, although this city here listens (observes) and at last perhaps will justify itself with much talk, acting according to duty. Whether it would be good, I do not know, as perhaps someone thinks, yes that some places should come to the community, to prevent blood among them or otherwise, as my gracious lords of Zurich or others. My lord Röst may act therein as he pleases. I show it out of duty. I ask you to greet him for me.</p>
      <p>As autumn will fall so quickly. Note, I will only come in autumn, for my own sake etc.</p>
      <p>Greetings to your house, Master Kaspar, Master Haben.</p>
      <p>What news you have, write by messenger. I have written to my dear Rordorffer before, if he wants to write to me. I ask you to be my servant, to inform him, to give to the messenger.</p>
      <p>Acted in St. Gallen, Thursday, the 5th day of August in the year 35.</p>
      <p>Your obliged, willing Hans Vogler in St. Gallen, citizen of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To my especially beloved lord and friend Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, to his own hands.</p>
