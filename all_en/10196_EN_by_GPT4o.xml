A hard line must be taken against the Catholic cantons. The five cantons and the Emperor should plan joint actions.

      <p>Greetings. I will take care of Otto Werdmüller on your behalf, even if he had not been a student before. It is so pleasing when something arises through which I can do you a favor.</p>
      <p>However, I hear about the people of Zurich, which pains me so much, especially after some hope was conceived from your previous letters, that I have almost despaired about you. Are you going to submit to those who neither have law nor right concerning the matters of God?</p>
      <p>From where, I ask, does this counsel come, if not from fear? But if you are afraid, there is no faith, no truth in you. Faith does not fear treachery, nor does truth fear falsehood. Have you violated peace because you imposed a penalty on those who listened to the Pope's mass? In what part? In what manner? Because you confessed, they say, among the conditions of peace that our old faith is "undoubted, Christian," etc. If they speak the truth, you are indeed miserable, even impious, who follow what you have thus proven to be the contrary; but if false, why did you not deny it openly, why did you not teach the falsehood, why do you not suffer whatever it is, so that the truth remains intact? Did you violate peace by promulgating commands in your domain according to God's command, which are right, salutary, and sanctify the name of the Lord? Or do they not rather violate not peace, I say, but the justice of God, because they try not only to suppress what you have done but also to render it false and impious? And this indeed against the conditions of peace. For it is written there that you should not wish to provoke their faith in their cities and domains by arguing or disputing in any way, which you have done. What command did you give to their people? What did you dispute among them? What did you attempt against them? Furthermore, there are two articles among the conditions of peace, against which their audacity clearly opposes, one concerning your faith, the other concerning your empire, rights, and privileges. What was done, did not your faith command it to be done in this way, and if you had done otherwise, would it not have been against faith? Then, will it not be allowed for you to act in your domain as you please? Since they are trying to prohibit this, why do you not rather accuse them? Do you still not know, what you have already experienced about these men and what is usually said about the cunning of women? While they fear their husbands for some misdeed, they begin to quarrel with them first, to deter their husbands from quarreling. Indeed, you lack a spirit supported by faith, unless everything deceives me, you lack prudence. For you did not want to listen to the prudent, which above all else instills despair in me. Good God, what kind of counsels have been proposed to you? If you had not rejected them, the matter would have come to this, that either you would have had to yield to the Cantons or openly act against them violently against treaties, against peace, against all right. You had asked for counsel, it was given, you gave thanks, you promised to follow it - and when the time came to use it, you rejected it in clear words.</p>
      <p>And who will henceforth advise you, even when you anxiously ask, or who will believe that you will act seriously for faith, for the justice of God, for a good and peaceful state in the future? I truly fear that the wrath of God threatens us all in common. You are unfortunate because you do not obey those who advise well and justly, we are unfortunate because what good we advise does not prevail with you. Hence we will be equally involved in evils in the end. But you listen to the wicked, the malicious, the impious, to whom truth and justice are displeasing, to whom it is displeasing to amend life in any way to the inheritance of God, such as those whom you propose to your republic today. For who does not delight in the gospel, will you preach otherwise about him?</p>
      <p>But listen, what the matter is. There was someone with me who certainly told me that he had discovered among the people of Lucerne and Schwyz that even if the dispute over the article of the mass had been brought to concord, another would arise anew, from whatever occasion it might be taken. For thus the Cantons have decreed without any hesitation that they will extirpate that faith or die. One of them added, namely the people of Schwyz: We have received such a promise from the Emperor that as soon as he is a little more tranquil than he has been so far, there will soon be an end to this depravity. If I could persuade you of this, indeed prove it to you as it has been proven to me, I would certainly not hesitate to write even to your senate. Although what need is there for this, when it is certain that the Cantons rely on imperial support, conduct counsels against us all with the papal legate, whom they had not long ago thrown into chains among the people of Uri? But this is not violating peace. Therefore, I dare to say that this peace was made for us, not for the Cantons - they have already violated it so many times with impunity - therefore it will happen that you will be forced either to depart from what is just in the end or willingly abandon what is true. But listen, what almost escaped me: What else is it to submit to judgment with them concerning the mass than to appoint a judge over the Holy Scripture? No one could force you into the debate at Baden, while things were most deceitful, and now you are compelled by such a slight moment? If you allow this, by the just judgment of God the word will be taken from you, if it is ever taken, which God forbid.</p>
      <p>What I write so ineptly, I write out of pain. They are so harsh and horrid. Please, for the Lord's sake, yield to pain. Moreover, if anything has deviated from the truth, I ask you to indicate the matter as it is. But if we have spoken all things truly, console, in whatever way you can, not only me but also him whom you know shares with me whatever counsels pertain to the common good and the honor of God.</p>
      <p>Besides these, the people of Strasbourg write continually about the matter of the Lord's Supper, nothing else, however, than what we have held as true so far, adding hope that soon the final confession of Luther, which the Saxon prince extorted after the death of his father, will be published, in which it will be clear that he agrees with us, allowing a trope in the words of the Supper. And I hear there is now a great contention with Luther among his own, as to how he will restrain those who are tumultuously raging. If these things are true, I hope a good part of Germany will be gained for the Lord. You will read a letter from Bucer sometime, in which he strives to placate you in your indignation. Make sure you prepare your mind so that after it arrives, you may consider all things more equitably.</p>
      <p>It remains that whatever we have written so far about the Cantons either to you or to Utinger, you burn or send back to me. For since we strive in vain with counsels, it is to be feared that from such writings danger may someday arise for us, if they come to light anywhere. Respond as quickly as you can.</p>
      <p>Farewell through the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the people of Zurich.</p>
