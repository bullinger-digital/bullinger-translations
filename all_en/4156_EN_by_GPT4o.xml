      <p>To the most distinguished Lord Bullinger, my most esteemed lord, Friedrich von Salis sends greetings.</p>
      <p>I received your letter dated the 3rd of this month in ZÃ¼rich late, most esteemed lord. I was saddened, however, because from your letter I understood that your son Christoph (who is as much mine as he is yours, since I love all that is yours no less than my own) has not yet recovered his former health. And indeed, I was even more saddened because I see you are equally downcast.</p>
      <p>But since I hope you will soon hear better news about your son, I certainly encourage you to be of good cheer. In the meantime, I will try to the best of my ability to inquire about his situation, and if I learn anything, I will inform you without any delay, although I find it difficult to find reliable messengers traveling to Venice now, as I did in Samaden; for from there, some of our people frequently go to Venice, but from here very few, and even fewer come from Venice to here. As a result, I have not received even a single letter from your son (as far as I remember) since I have been here. However, I sent your letters, which you entrusted to me for your son for the third time, very diligently and, as I believe, safely, indeed as I thought at the time, when I handed them over to the messengers, I transmitted them most safely. The first ones, which I know your son received, as a certain Master Johannes Dreatza, my distinguished friend who is in Venice, informed me, I sent through a certain envoy from the Val Camonica, who had come to us in Chur; the second ones I sent through a certain neighbor of mine, named Peter Lochar from Agnedina, and the last ones I sent through Lord Jordan, a Venetian bookseller, whom I certainly do not believe broke his trust.</p>
      <p>If, however, these messengers have deceived me, they would have offended me no less than you. But I will take the utmost care to have these last letters of yours delivered to him as diligently as I can.</p>
      <p>But if by chance things do not turn out as desired (which is the rashness and inconstancy of men), I earnestly ask you not to doubt my loyalty towards you and all yours, indeed I wish you to be persuaded that I have nothing more important or more pleasant than to comply with your wishes and to gratify your will, etc. I have nothing new to write at present except what I indicate in these attached letters of mine, which I would have sent to you sooner if I had not been hindered by the lack of couriers. If in the future anything worthy of knowing arises, I will inform you.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again and most happily, most esteemed lord, and bid all yours very much farewell in my name. My son Johannes also sends greetings to you and all yours.</p>
      <p>Given in Chiavenna on the 12th of December, 1559. The same as above, most devoted to you, Friedrich von Salis.</p>
