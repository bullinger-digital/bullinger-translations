    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer has not yet commented on the book purchase proposed by Bullinger [in favor of Johannes von Ulm, who is studying in Zurich, and his fellow student Augustin...], as he does not have the authority in this matter. Therefore, he wanted to wait for the family meeting planned for today, where the guardianship of the children of his deceased brother-in-law [Heinrich von Ulm] was to be arranged. However, Blarer had to realize that [Johannes von Ulm], who manages the money for his [half]brother studying in Zurich alone, is not inclined to finance this considerable additional expense beyond the usual maintenance expenses. The best would be if [Johannes, who is studying in Zurich] would go to Teufen on Christmas Day or the following Sunday [December 28] when the accounts are settled there. Perhaps he could then persuade his [half]brother to buy the books with the support of the other relatives.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger is to be thanked for taking such good care of the young men [Johannes von Ulm and Augustin...]. Bullinger may have thought that Johannes was wealthy or that his deceased father [Hans Jakob von Ulm] had left him money. This is not the case. Johannes has nothing except the little that his [half]brother gives him. And the latter does not want to make large expenditures because he lacks cash, as he cannot collect anything from the farmers. He would therefore need to be cleverly persuaded. Hence, Johannes should try his luck at Christmas. Who knows? Blarer will also advocate for this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] [Konrad] Hofherr credibly asserts (as his wife [...] also testifies) that he lent the sum of money [owed to Regula Mayer, his host in Zurich] as well as the previous six guilders [owed to Hans Meefuss] to his brother-in-law Fridle [...] in Bischofszell and even vouched for him because the latter had to spend about 100 guilders due to an incompetent person [...]. But just as Fridle repaid the six guilders on time, he will also repay the remaining amount punctually. [Regula Mayer] is mistaken about the repayment date. It was not agreed for St. Martin's Day [November 11, 1546], but for St. Matthias' Day [February 24, 1547]. Only then will [Regula Mayer] receive her money.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Blarer wrote the above today without knowing about this suddenly appearing messenger [...] who wants to leave soon. Blarer is really not negligent in transmitting news, but in recent days he has not heard anything new (except rumors about the death of Emperor [Charles V]) and has also not learned anything from the Konstanz council.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Blarer will send Bullinger's letter [not received] to Augsburg tomorrow, as no messenger was available to him yesterday and today.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Ulm is negotiating a peace [with the Emperor], which displeases many, as this violates the [Schmalkaldic] alliance terms. The Augsburgers, on the other hand, are holding out bravely and have written to the people of Ulm that they would also make peace if they could do so with a clear conscience, which is not possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] It is suspected that Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] will persuade the King of France [Francis I] during his stay to take an active interest in the [war] matter [in Germany], so that France's Dauphin [Henry Roman] becomes king. Blarer cannot report further on this now, but perhaps the Konstanz council will write something about it to the Zurich council.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] God be with us! As long as we hold on to Him, He will not abandon us.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Blarer sends back the letters [from and to Theobald Thamer] with thanks, which he read with great interest.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Bullinger should also return [Georg] Frölich's letter and continue to fervently pray for the [German Protestants].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] The Emperor is re-enlisting all the mercenaries [on leave from the Schmalkaldic League]. How can he be dead then!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Duke Ulrich [of Württemberg] is recalling the already dismissed troops. The Duke will certainly not agree to a false peace [with the Emperor].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] In haste.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Bullinger should deliver the two enclosed letters to Hans Schöner of Augsburg and inform him that Blarer cannot write this time. There is supposed to be a song [...] by Schöner that Blarer has not yet seen. Bullinger should lend Schöner ten guilders, which Blarer will repay with the next messenger. Blarer must stop; the messenger [...] wants to leave.</p>

      <p>16th day of December. Regarding the library and good books, I have not been able to write you a response, as I neither have the authority nor the command for it. And since I knew that the family meeting was supposed to take place here in Konstanz today to appoint the guardian for my dear brother-in-law's deceased child, I deliberately wanted to wait so that I could discuss it with some of them, which I have done. However, since no one but his brother is spending money on behalf of Hans von Ulm, and it is evident that he is not inclined to spend more, thinking he is doing enough by providing mere maintenance, the best advice for Hans now in Zurich is to arrange to go to Teufen on Christmas Day or the following Sunday, as accounts will be settled then. There, he might be able to persuade his brother to do the best in this matter, and the others could also speak in favor of achieving something.</p>

      <p>Thank you most kindly for taking such faithful care of the boys and bearing responsibility for them. But you might think the boy has something or that his late father left him something. But that is not the case. He has absolutely nothing except what his brother gives him. The brother, however (speaking confidentially to you), is not willing to give much, as he is not currently liquid. One cannot collect anything from the farmers. If they give nothing, he has nothing. But the good young man should try his luck, as mentioned, at Christmas. Perhaps God will grant him something. I will support him as much as I can.</p>

      <p>Regarding Curio's debt, he assures me truthfully (as his dear wife also acknowledges) that he lent this money, as well as the previous six guilders, to his brother-in-law Fridle in Bischofszell and vouched for him. His brother-in-law will also pay this money back honestly, as he did the other. But the good woman is completely mistaken, as the deadline is not at St. Martin's, but at St. Matthias'. For at that time, they borrowed the money and not at St. Martin's. They will surely remember if they think back correctly. His brother-in-law has now otherwise incurred a burden because of a useless person, having to pay about 100 guilders. Otherwise, Curio says, he would have no problem giving her the money right now. But it will be paid honestly at St. Matthias'. Therefore, tell the woman to be patient in the meantime.</p>

      <p>I wrote the enclosed letter today and knew nothing about this messenger. He suddenly appears and wants to leave. I do not know what the rumors are. I am truly and certainly not negligent, as you might suspect. But in recent days, I have truly heard nothing certain except various street rumors that the emperor is dead and the like. Likewise, I have found nothing certain with my lords. Therefore, do not suspect me of negligence.</p>

      <p>Ulm is holding itself partisan; negotiating for peace. Others are displeased, as this is against the alliance. Augsburg is holding itself excellently. They have written to those of Ulm that if it could be done with God and a good conscience, they would also like to have peace with good conditions as they do; but they cannot come to that. God grant much grace and good!</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>It is suspected that the Landgrave, while with the French, insists that they take up the matter with force so that the Dauphin becomes king. I cannot write as much as I would like. Perhaps my lords will write to yours about it.</p>

      <p>To Hans Schöner of Augsburg, enclosed are 2 letters and tell him I truly cannot write this time. There is supposed to be a song somewhere. Listen to it. It has not yet come to me. I ask you to lend him 10 guilders. I will send it back to you with the next messenger. I truly have no time now to count and pack much. The messenger wants to leave. Dated in haste, 16th of December.</p>
