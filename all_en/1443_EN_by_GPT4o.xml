      <p>Grace and mercy from the Lord. Upon receiving the letters for Vergerius, I immediately handed them over to one of his subjects to be presented to him. I recently read letters from Rome dated September 10th, written in the hand of our bishop, in which he indicates that he has been absolved (albeit burdened by papal conditions) and that he will come as far as Bologna with the Pope (where that beast will go to be more quickly informed of his affairs from Trent), and afterwards to Trent for the council, from which place he will finally return home. Our papists are plotting many and great things; they persuade themselves that their affairs are on solid ground. May the most gracious God deign to deliver us from their teeth. Our Johannes Pontasella has come to you for not insignificant reasons, which he will explain in person. He is a man of integrity and should be trusted; he is not treated among us according to his merit. For two whole years, he has received nothing of his salary; I wonder how he lives and how he can endure. I pray that you, as you are accustomed, will be willing to assist him. May you deign to inform us about Swiss, Imperial, and other matters.</p>
      <p>I heard from someone coming from the Adige that nothing has yet been done in Trent, but they are still arranging and preparing to present themselves as worthy of birth. From Chur, October 26, 1551. Philipp and Heimius send you greetings.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in piety and learning, Master Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church in ZÃ¼rich, his esteemed lord and brother.</p>
