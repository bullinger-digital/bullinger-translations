    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's letter [No. 1455] and will convey its content further. Regrets the emperor's and other princes' rejecting attitude towards the Reformation; may God grant them insight and steadfastness to the persecuted fellow believers; it is to be hoped that the Protestant princes will oppose the persecution; the disunity of the Catholic princes weakens them greatly, which gives hope for peace in the empire; may God guide people towards unity. Relief over the consensus in the doctrine of the Lord's Supper; God will grant Bucer a more steadfast disposition. Sends back writings. As a token of thanks for Bullinger's efforts, he sends four marmots. Greetings, also to Leo Jud.</p>

      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, a learned and most humane man, most deserving ecclesiastic of Zurich, Johannes Travers of the Grisons wishes grace, peace, and safety in life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your letters, my most friendly Bullinger, were brought to me by my relative, in which you have made clear what I was so eager to learn from you. I will likewise communicate this to the brothers scattered here and there, so that with a clear front, what is true may be opposed to the foaming adversaries. It is to be lamented, alas, that the minds of the Emperor and many other kings and princes are so corrupted by papal ferment that they attempt to overturn the glory of Christ, our Redeemer, and to destroy the authors of truth and the living members of the church with their tyranny. May the gods grant these profane princes a sounder mind, so that they may both recognize and embrace what is wholesome and Christian, and grant our pious and catholic men perseverance in goodness and true constancy in the storms of persecution. We must hope that the Christian princes, true monarchs, will be protected by the powerful hand of God as a defense of the truth against all the machinations of the adversaries, and, if necessity urges, be able to restrain the tyranny and power of the enemies not less by arms than by virtue and just occasion of defense. The defection of the Elector Palatine and the Margrave of Brandenburg, and other princes, has taken much hope and support from the adversaries. Indeed, in my judgment, it was the best omen for the tranquility of Germany. May the best and greatest God so compose the minds of all princes, instructed by evangelical truth, that they may seek and keep the glory of Jesus Christ and Christian concord from the heart. Furthermore, regarding the unanimous understanding of the Eucharist you write about, I have sufficiently learned from the papers sent to me. Praise and glory to the immortal God! I know that by this matter, the adversaries will not have grounds to slander us about mutual dissension in the future. The Lord will also grant our Bucer a more steadfast spirit. Moreover, I return the writings you sent under the request for restitution, albeit later than you asked; take it in good part; the scarcity of messengers traveling from here to you caused this. Finally, I have immortal thanks for you, most esteemed Heinrich, for having undertaken so much labor and expense for my sake, for which I have nothing worthy to repay you. I send four marmots, which our Alps are fertile with, although they do not deserve the name of a gift, since they are rare there, yet they are suitable for eating; do not disdain to receive them; I beg you to regard more the spirit of your ever-devoted Travers. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet Leo Jud and the other brothers with your family very much in my name. From Zuoz, February 10, 1541.</p>
      <p>To the true specimen of various letters to Heinrich Bullinger [ecclesiastic] of Zurich, a catholic man, my much-revered lord.</p>
