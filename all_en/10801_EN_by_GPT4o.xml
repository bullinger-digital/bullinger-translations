    <p xml:id="regest1">Is highly pleased with Bullinger's letter [No. 748 (and 753?)]. Luther has been informed [about the outcome of the Basel meeting], but his response is still pending. Capito has already written regarding the teaching position for a son [Christoph Klauser's]; at that pharmacist, whom Bucer prefers, a position will only be available in September.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, esteemed and dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>It cannot be expressed how much your letters have delighted us. Continue on this path; it is the Lord's, do not doubt. We have informed Luther of everything, but due to the length of the journey, we have not yet been able to receive a response. The common people on both sides do not always understand. But it is true that they are more irrational, for nothing has been done with the common people yet, because nothing has been settled with the leaders. Let us endure the work of the Lord. I hope that what you so greatly desire, you will soon have.</p>
      <p>Capito, I believe, has already written about the son of the doctor of medicine. He has a certain pharmacist who is willing to take him in, but they will negotiate when they see him. Another person, more skilled in this art, will take him in, but not until September, and this one is more inclined towards piety; the other, if I am not mistaken, has not yet proven by his life that he understands Christ very well. But religion is foremost in all life.</p>
      <p>Greet warmly the entire choir of saints there, Leo, Pellican, Bibliander, and the others.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, March 11.</p>
      <p>M. Bucer.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Christ, M. Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed colleague and brother. Zurich.</p>
