      <p>In the state of France, nothing has changed since I wrote to you, except that the Parisians are daily lowering their high spirits more and more.</p>
      <p>First, the court was broken or at least subdued by the king's decree; then it came to the common city.</p>
      <p>Indeed, by a bad example, all the acts of the court were rescinded, and whatever dignity was in that order was abolished, and although a violent remedy was needed to correct the madness, I am nevertheless displeased that authority, which had flourished there for two centuries, is overthrown by imperial and almost tyrannical custom.</p>
      <p>For it was useful for the intercession to prevail, which would put a brake on the royal decrees; now, however, all the counselors were forced to be present when the decree was pronounced with open doors, by which they are marked with notable infamy.</p>
      <p>For nothing is more disgraceful than for all the acts, where they had exceeded the limit, to be torn up in their sight and for them to be forbidden to dare to attempt anything similar in the future.</p>
      <p>The king himself received the envoys, who had been sent once and again, with contempt; therefore, all were driven by terror to obey.</p>
      <p>Now the ferocity of that turbulent populace is tamed, others will cease to riot.</p>
      <p>The provincials have been severely enjoined not to delay or impede the execution of the edict any longer.</p>
      <p>The Guise family has also been restrained, nor did they take the king's threats to intervene badly, because the admiral was superior in forces.</p>
      <p>Good hope has shone again regarding internal discord; however, the plague is raging in an incredible manner both among the Basques and in the Loire region; Lyon is still untouched.</p>
      <p>Twenty-five banners had been sent, which halted on the way until news of the death of our neighbor was brought, whom they say is recovering; he has not yet set a day for the Bernese.</p>
      <p>As for your excuses, I do not wish to argue with you; God, the just judge, will hear our just complaints.</p>
      <p>If you inquire more diligently, you will find that your envoys, after they have fulfilled their mandates, have applied themselves more vigorously to the cause than the Lucerne people.</p>
      <p>We remain silent until the opportunity invites us to speak. For what you have again obtained from the most honorable council for good men, what they were asking for, I thank you in my name and theirs.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man and my venerable brother. May the Lord keep you safe, sustain you with virtue, and bless your labors!</p>
      <p>Many greetings to the fellow ministers, your wife, and the whole family. Geneva, October 20, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>Your Ionville greets you reverently and from the heart.</p>
