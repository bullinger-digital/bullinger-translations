      <p>The grace of God be with you. I had thought that my dear wife and I had shown you all loyalty and kindness, as all reasonable people recognize with us. However, you have written two letters to my brother, one from my house, the other from Bremgarten (which is your Schaffhausen, where you wanted to ride correctly), from which I well understood how recognized and grateful you are; you mock (sarcastically) the gospel, from which we or at least my wife learned that we should not do to you, what you did not learn in the papal faith, that you do.</p>
      <p>The gospel will not be hindered by your and your kind's mockery. You say that from your closest friends you encounter adversity and not friendliness; it is truly a pity and a loss for you, what good we have done for you; you have not scratched anyone from us; whoever tells you that from us speaks, as you write, does not know what. If we have then licked you in those matters that displease us about you, then your skin is thicker and rougher than that of the Danes and oak trees. May God grant you that you act and speak with reason and become a different person; for your matter will not be of any use. We desire little from you in the future, since after so many loyal warnings and admonitions from me and my dear wife, you express through letters with malicious mockery what mind and recognition, also love for us you have, and you write cheerfully, you find no one offended by you except my brother alone.</p>
      <p>If we are so false to you, then let us be right in our actions until you better recognize who is loyal to you. But if my brother is so offended by you, then see that you recognize it differently towards him than towards us. May God grant you a calm, just mind, that walks in love and in His commandments; we wish you this from the heart, whether you consider us just or false. God knows us; may He grant us grace at all times. Dated in Zurich, May 18, 1551.</p>
