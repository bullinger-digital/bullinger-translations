      <p>Greetings. I have received your letter.</p>
      <p>Your greetings, which came from a paternal heart, have greatly affected me. When I hear that the church and the Swiss republic are still intact, I consider it a great part of my well-being. For we are confident that the cultivation of religion and political discipline can be disseminated from here, as it has been to other nations and kingdoms, to us and many islands. In this work, you have certainly invested much effort and will continue to do so. The ecclesiastical matters here remain as they have been.</p>
      <p>However, privately, more members are being added to Christ than before. For some time now, public persecution of Christians in these parts has ceased.</p>
      <p>My studies are somewhat more disturbed.</p>
      <p>More at another time, God willing.</p>
      <p>Greet your entire household, to whom I confess I am bound by favor and kindness. I hope that there will be an opportunity to deserve well of them someday.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Groningen, Friesland, in the year of the birth of Christ 1557, on the 8th day before the calends of January.</p>
      <p>Nikolaus von Starkenburg.</p>
      <p>To the most renowned man, the most vigilant minister of the divine word, this letter.</p>
