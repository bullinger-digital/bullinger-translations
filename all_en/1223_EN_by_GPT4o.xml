      <p>On the 10th of March, the Roman king, with three sons and a great nobility, also many people from Augsburg, rode to Munich; there his young ladies are also supposed to come to their sister, the Duchess of Bavaria; they will stay there for a few days, then proceed to Vienna in Austria. The king has conducted himself exceedingly well along with his entourage, paying everyone in Augsburg well and friendly upon departure, and maintained good order as long as he was there with his retinue. All complaints are about the Spaniards; they do not pay and quarrel with the people over everything, so that their hosts are always in danger.</p>
      <p>The Imperial Majesty, along with the prince and Queen Maria, are still in Augsburg, and there is no word on when they intend to depart.</p>
      <p>The entire land of Transylvania is said to earnestly desire the king and want to hand over the land to him entirely. Likewise, the Bohemians want the king's eldest son, namely Maximilian, to be their king; he is supposed to be crowned in Pressburg now. Otherwise, I have no news from Augsburg.</p>
      <p>From Lindau, I am informed that some well-meaning citizens, without the knowledge of the council, have brought their preacher, Master Mathis Rot, whom the council had praised, to Arbon on the 12th of March and taken him to Lindau. He was then summoned before the council on the 18th of March; what was dealt with him is not yet known; however, he has not yet preached. I am concerned that the good man will come into suffering along with some people with him; for this does not seem to me the proper way. He stayed for a while in St. Gallen; Fortm√ºller writes to me that his lords were therefore looked upon with suspicion and treated badly at the meeting in Baden.</p>
      <p>I did not want to write anything further to you, as I am aware of how occupied you are with ecclesiastical matters. May the Lord most graciously grant you His spirit. Pray diligently for me and mine. When you have time, please respond somewhat to the question I recently posed to you, whether a magistrate should in every way prevent his citizen from the ministry of the church if he attempts to minister to a church outside the limits of his jurisdiction. Farewell, my venerable and dearest brother. March 26th.</p>
      <p>Yours, A. B.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
