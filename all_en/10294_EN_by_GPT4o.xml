    <p xml:id="regest1">Refutes rumors circulating in St. Gallen that Mass will soon be held again in Zürich, and hopes for Vadian's correct assessment of the origin of such misconceptions. The Five Places propose a ban on mercenary service in the Common Lordships, about which a Diet will be held in Baden. There, the people of Zürich want to dissuade the Five Places from an alliance with the Pope and other powers. Zürich's demands for the long-overdue papal wages have so far remained unfulfilled, but should, if necessary, be repeated without concessions with the help of the other places. Urges the completion of Vadian's "Epitome."</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God.</p>
      <p>Dear esteemed sir, I understand from Niclaus that some strange rumors are circulating among you, suggesting that soon Mass will be held again in Zürich and that we will agree with the Pope, and many other things that do not surprise me at all, since these words have been used for several years now, even when our position was less firm and less persecuted. However, nothing of the sort has been undertaken or is in any way planned among us. Those whose hearts are more inclined towards superstition than towards religion may well hope for such things, just as the Jews hope for their Messiah. But there are still so many pious and honest people who take pleasure and delight in the truth that I trust God and all the pious for better things, which are still showing themselves in such a way that none of them dare to let themselves go. Yet I hope you yourself understand the matter and their vain boasting, that among you, us, and everywhere there is a decent populace.</p>
      <p>Regarding the alliance, I can neither poorly nor precisely ascertain that it has been made, but I always hear that it is still pending. What our people want in this regard, I will not withhold from you in confidence. The Five Places have written and requested from my lords that they impose a ban in the bailiwicks, so that no one goes to war (observe the cunning and tricksters), for they suspect that an uprising might occur, as in the years when some went to the French, others to the Pope, etc. To this, my lords are not satisfied, for they always believe that the Five Places, who always attract foreign lords to themselves, are the cause of this and other things, etc. Therefore, a Diet will now be held on Michaelmas in Baden. There, my lords intend to admonish the Five Places to refrain from the Pope and other lords, to see what the alliances can achieve, and that the alliance with the Pope is disadvantageous to us, etc. This has been shown to me by not the least influential people, that they want to use the sword as needed against all those who break the peace, who are found to be stubborn and [help] against the sworn letter, etc. As for the papal wages, which have been solicited for years and finally written about, when one submits to the Roman Church, as I wrote before, my lords have appointed Master Hans Haben to demand plainly that they want a useful answer, for they intend to remain in their faith, grounded in the New and Old Testament. If the wages are owed to them, he has held them off with good words for over 10 years; they want to have them once, etc. If he does not want to, they intend to deal with the other places, to hold him to payment or expulsion, etc. And since it is expected that he will give something useful, they hope to expel him through this means. For as Lucerne holds with it, so my lords will also hold against them, if there is anyone among us to whom they have a claim.</p>
      <p>In summary: Our faith is not in a bad state, except that we, like everywhere, have people. Yet God still maintains His honor and gives much strength to His own. "Virtus in infirmitate perficitur" [2 Corinthians 12:9]. God be with you. And let the Epitome be of concern to you, for there is great desire and inquiry about it.</p>
      <p>Zürich, September 21, 1533.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man, Joachim Vadian, most prudent consul of St. Gallen, his most respected lord.</p>
