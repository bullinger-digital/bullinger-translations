      <p>Greetings. I am returning to you, most delightful lord and godfather, the letters you shared with me, and I thank you greatly for this service. The Lord works everywhere and advances the cause of His church in a marvelous way; to Him be praise forever. Amen. I also thank you for your Catechism sent to me; Mr. Musculus and Diesbachius also express their gratitude.</p>
      <p>I am still unable to write about the outcome of the Geneva affair.</p>
      <p>The mayor of Basel was here, complaining bitterly (which is no wonder) about giving judgments, and he urged my lords to settle the matter through a friendly agreement.</p>
      <p>My lords have agreed to this, so that the matter of the pandects (legal experts) would be completely resolved and there would be no need to quarrel again the next day. He then rode to Geneva, where he received a negative response for the second time; however, when he insisted for the third time, they agreed to sit down with my lords themselves and settle their dispute; as for the pandects, they do not want their opinions to be considered.</p>
      <p>Since now almost as much as nothing (for only the day before yesterday the mayor announced this to the council and citizens), my lords have also rejected the matter and urged the mayor to give his judgment as soon as possible. We are now waiting for that.</p>
      <p>In all this, as I have written to you before, the people of Geneva have captured one of my lords' subjects, who was formerly their citizen but many years ago left the city with the knowledge and consent of my lords and moved to Geneva. They accuse him of having involved himself with the pandects in some way (I cannot yet fully understand their accusation). When my lords learned of this, they wrote to them a second time, asking them to act prudently in view of these dangerous times and to leave their people in peace or to pursue them with justice and to release this man for now, to which they received a simple reply that they are concerned they might let the judge go; therefore, my lords quickly sent Mr. Treasurer Steiger there. We do not yet know what good he will bring, as he has not yet returned.</p>
      <p>With this, the resentment grows more and more to the great disadvantage of both parties, and unfortunately, it has come to the point where nothing helps to mediate anymore.</p>
      <p>In Geneva, no citizen dares to speak joyfully with a Bernese. In Lausanne, everything is fairly stable.</p>
      <p>Since you had no one to show us, two of our people have been chosen to teach there. One is Adrian Blauner, who once taught the Hebrew language here; he has been assigned the theological lecture; he is not unsuitable for the academic profession; he is from Aarau, and although he once seemed to lean towards the opposing side, we still hope well of him. The other is Johannes Knechtenhofer, whom I believe you know; he spent some time in Zurich; since he has made elegant progress in Greek literature, he has been appointed to the Greek lecture in Lausanne. May the Lord make this calling beneficial to the church, to them, and to all of us! The Frischings each paid me fifteen crowns and one to my wife.</p>
      <p>However, when I had them with me, they were still very young; now they are more mature. You will greet them in my name, along with your wife, sons-in-law, and the entire family, especially your son Heinrich, to whom I congratulate together with you and Mr. Gwalther on the new alliance, which I hear from others' letters has been contracted between you. May the Lord bless the new couple and all of you. Amen.</p>
      <p>Trempius, struck by apoplexy, lies fatally ill; may the Lord be with the good old man! Bern, July 15, 1559.</p>
      <p>From France, we have nothing except news of the splendor of the weddings, and that among the cups, serious threats have been spread by the Savoyard nobles against the Bernese bear. In Cambrai, we hear that the Duke of Savoy has minted new coins with the inscription: "Tout ou rien," which means: "All or nothing." I have a relative, Herbort, who claims to have seen that coin. They also say that Philibert is leading his bride to Philip to some unknown port in Spain; Philip does not want to trust France. He has appointed his illegitimate sister, the wife of Ottavio Farnese, to the Belgian government. She recently passed through Zofingen; he himself is traveling to Spain.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, his lord and godfather, to be honored perpetually.</p>
