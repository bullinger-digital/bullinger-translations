    <p xml:id="regest1">Rejoices over Bullinger's letter [No. 1190], which freed him from the doubt whether he was still well-disposed towards him; rumors that Myconius had fallen away from the faith are absurd. Complains about the renewed attempt by the university to subordinate the church officials and, through their incorporation, to make itself the head of the church similar to the Pope. Sends a letter and money from Bern for Stephan Willi, who is likely staying with Pellikan.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You have greatly cheered me with your recent letter, dearest Bullinger, as it showed your unchanged disposition towards me, about which I had almost begun to doubt, wondering if perhaps it had changed. Everything today is so suspect that I often pray to the Lord for an end to these evils. There is a rumor from there that some speak very badly of me, both privately and publicly, as if I had fallen away from the faith.</p>
      <p>This matter pains me, not for my own sake, but because the judgments of men are so vain. All things ought to be judged in the Lord, not in the vanity of our senses.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I suffer so much for Christ and am said to have fallen away? I am sustained by faith alone; hence my strongest consolation.</p>
      <p>Besides other things, the university people are now attacking me with this effort, to have the holy ministry of the church subjected to them. What kind of pride do you think Satan has here? They pretend to want one body of themselves and the ministers. Therefore, I say, they are no longer of the body of Christ, that is, the church; for we are its members. What then? They must be something different from the church. Let them come to us, and one body will be made. But they want something else, namely to be the head, apparently with no other mind than the Pope claims to be the head of the universal church. These trifles grieve me. I ask you, by the Lord, to bear these things with me; for there is no other reason why I expose them to you. In the meantime, I wish these things to be kept in your bosom. Sympathize and console.</p>
      <p>In the bundle of letters, you will find a letter in which money is enclosed. It comes from Bern and pertains to Stephan Willi; I ask you to deliver it. I believe it is with Pellikan.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ with your family and always love me. Hastily, Basel, November 9, 1538.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his brother in the Lord to be respected.</p>
