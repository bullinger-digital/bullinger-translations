    <p xml:id="regest1">Recognizes in what Bullinger [in No. 2037] writes a threat to the churches; does not believe he can achieve anything with him, but sees himself as a member of the church obliged to respond. Intends to answer in order what Bullinger writes [1.] about the [Eucharistic] dispute, [2.] about Luther's latest writing ["Short Confession"], and [3.] about Bucer's efforts for concord, and does so with utmost seriousness before the face of the Lord. [1.] [The Zurichers and other reformed churches of the Confederation] teach, according to Bullinger, the spiritual presence of Christ in the meal and say Luther calls this heresy; they deny the bodily presence of Christ and accuse Luther of teaching like the confession of Berengar [of Tours], which contradicts the human body of Christ and its glorification. However, that Christ is present only in his work contradicts the [biblical] scriptures and the teachings of the early church; Paul, Irenaeus, Hilary, Chrysostom, Cyril, and others teach about the body of Christ in such a way that its offering cannot be questioned. Luther, with his reference to Berengar and his insistence on bodily eating, wants to ensure only this offering of the whole Christ; body and bread are so connected by the "unio sacramentalis" that, according to the "communicatio idiomatum," what happens to the bread can be said of Christ; even the fathers taught this way, and Luther has demonstrated the scriptural correctness of this manner of speaking in his great confession ["On the Lord's Supper," 1528]. In agreement with Luther, transubstantiation and the permanent connection of Christ with the bread are to be rejected, but otherwise, there is nothing to criticize in the rightly understood teaching of Berengar and the "sophists" [scholastics], such as Thomas Aquinas. Bucer and many others can testify that Luther is solely concerned with this true offering of Christ, which is not to be understood in a sensory or rational way, but only in faith; may the Lord help Bullinger to the right understanding, for it concerns the matter of Christ, and Bullinger's opponent is highly esteemed by many churches. If Bullinger understands the location of Christ in heaven in an earthly way [i.e., locally], he must prove this from scripture, not just from Augustine and Fulgentius; what scriptural evidence speaks against a presence of Christ and his body that can be grasped by faith, which corresponds to the participation in the heavenly gift and the Holy Spirit according to Heb. 6 [4]? The reference to the glorified bodies of the resurrected, 1 Cor. 15 [35-58], does not lead further; Peter's walking on water, the appearance of Moses and Elijah on Mount Tabor, the visible presence of Christ to Stephen indicate that the body of Christ can be present without detriment to its human nature; the simple sense of scripture must not be reinterpreted. The words of Christ and Paul are clear, and all comparable passages prove that with the symbol, Christ himself is also offered; what [Zwingli] once taught about the communion of the body of Christ is not acceptable and was not approved by Oecolampadius, as Paul speaks of a communion of believers with the body of the Lord. To accuse Luther of deviating from the word of God is a slander. At the Bern Disputation, Bucer only rejected an earthly understood presence of Christ; Oecolampadius shared his view, as his "Dialogus" ["What the Ancients Thought about the Eucharist"] shows, and Zwingli also seems to have taught so in his response to Eck ["On the Insults of Eck"]; that Luther does not acknowledge this is not surprising, as even [the Zurichers] do not emphasize this [2.] As for Luther himself, Bullinger should consider in what outstanding manner he works for the Lord. Restraint is appropriate in judging the faults of others, especially when they have hurt us. Other Bible interpreters are also forgiven for their shortcomings because of their merits, such as Erasmus; Luther's vehemence is comparable to our attitude towards the Anabaptists, as he sees the word of God in danger in this struggle; it is tragic that his concern was newly nourished after it was dispelled [in 1536] by the [First Helvetic] Confession from Basel. That [the Zurichers] want to defend their reputation is understandable, but if they had adhered to the achieved concord [of 1536] and promoted it, a serious offense to the church would have been avoided. Bucer must acknowledge Luther as a fellow servant in the Lord; whoever rejects such a one sins. In his writing not yet available to Bullinger, Luther condemns, to Bucer's regret, all who deny that Christ was even received by the godless (impius) Judas with the mouth, which undoubtedly also targets [the Zurichers]; Bucer shares Luther's view only insofar as the reception of the body of Christ by the unworthy (indignos) is evident from the [1.] Corinthians [11, 29], but admits that Luther's view of a reception of the body of Christ even by the godless is too comprehensive and categorical and comes too close to the papist view of a continuous presence of Christ in the symbols. However, it is not Bucer's place to oppose Luther; due to renewed provocation by [the Zurichers], Luther sees the faith as a whole threatened at this point; Luther is as the Lord has given him to us, and it is unthinkable to excommunicate him for this reason. Bucer, like many others, is convinced that [the Zurichers], despite their not entirely scriptural teaching, are by no means of the devil, but he defends Luther for his merits. Bucer behaves towards him in a way that he can answer for before the church and Christ. That Bullinger wants to defend Zwingli's statements about [the salvation] of Hercules, Numa, Scipio, the [two] Catos, and the great Frankish kings worries Bucer greatly, for even if some pagans like Job were not unfamiliar with true worship of God, God has given Israel a special position; Bullinger should refrain from this endeavor, as [the Zurichers] would otherwise be considered Epicureans who make salvation dependent solely on right conduct. [3.] Bullinger has urged him [with No. 2037] to abandon his efforts for concord; he, however, thanks God that thanks to his efforts, all churches except the Swiss adhere to the Wittenberg Concord; even the church of Constance seems to adhere to it, although it has not signed the concord; he has not been striving for [the Zurichers] for years, as they do not sufficiently adhere to the [First Helvetic] Confession. He only brought up the matter [in No. 2028 and 2031] to make Bullinger more cautious, for Luther can only consider them brothers if they do not dispute the true offering of the body of Christ; this seemed to be the case [in 1536 with the First Helvetic Confession], so Bucer saw the only difference in the different precision of the statements. Even the paraphrases of the manner of reception did not contradict each other. Since the Zurichers, albeit reluctantly, agreed to the clear formulations of the [First Helvetic] Confession, he hoped to unite all of Germany in this concord, but when he noticed their changed attitude [in 1538], he left them to the Lord; the unfriendly treatment he and Capito received in Zurich at that time has been forgiven. The request not to reconcile [the Zurichers] with Luther anymore has already been considered earlier; in other places, however, Bucer continues to promote concord with God's help; Bullinger's wish that Bucer had never started it is not shared by others. He urgently asks him not to mention him and his efforts in the response to Luther, as Luther did not do either, otherwise he would have to publicly refute Bullinger; he rejects Bullinger's recently heard accusation of insincerity (for which he would deserve a beating); dragging him into this dispute would reveal to everyone Bullinger's ingratitude towards Bucer - who already has more than enough to do with the opponents in Cologne; especially the dispute over this sacrament greatly harms the churches and will be convenient for the [Roman] Antichrist at the upcoming Diet [in Worms]; never before has one been so close to condemning the teaching [of the Confederates] by a public imperial decree. Even if Luther gave cause for it, a response [from the Zurichers] should be omitted; Philipp [Melanchthon] wrote to Bucer in this sense, and Bucer, who also joins this wish, at least hopes that the [irritated Confederates] will respond moderately. Bucer urges mutual tolerance and wants to know if Bullinger is willing to spare him this unnecessary fight. [Postscript:] Thanks for his efforts for him and the prince [Ottheinrich of the Palatinate] regarding the [„Bibliotheca universalis“ by Konrad Gessner].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, and those counsels which are salutary for the church of God and advance the glory of Christ. Your letter, most learned Bullinger and esteemed in the Lord, I read with the spirit I ought to, foreseeing the great evils that threaten the churches from what you write. I will respond to you briefly, not because I hope to achieve those things which I do not doubt are to be desired for the churches of Christ in their present miserable state, but so that I may leave it as a testimony with you that I have attempted to fulfill my duty, which I owe to the church, as a member of it, even against the hope that human reason can sustain. In your letter, you address three main points: first, you touch upon the matter itself, which is being contested; then you add some things about Luther and his recent writing; finally, you also mention some things about me and my efforts for the concord of the churches. Concerning these matters, I will confess and testify to you in that very order what I feel, that I now approve before our Lord and Savior and will approve on that day when all things will be judged. For neither the matter itself nor the present state of the churches nor the office of either of us nor our age allows us to do anything without the utmost religious duty and as if in the sight of our Lord and God Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Therefore, touching upon the cause which is in contention, you define what is disputed between you and Luther. You write that you affirm the presence of Christ in the supper to be spiritual and yet effective, denying it to be bodily; you acknowledge Christ to be present to the church, not bodily, as he is at the right hand of the Father, but by power, virtue, and operation; Luther, however, condemns this opinion as heresy (which you ascribe to the primitive church and the ancient doctors) and establishes a bodily presence, which is perceived by hands and mouth, such as the Sophists also posit, except for the comment of transubstantiation, and the canon "Ego Berengarius" explains; and you assert that this opinion of Luther cannot stand with the truth of the human body in Christ and its heavenly glory. Concerning the opinion which you make your own, by which you define the presence of the Lord in his church and supper solely by the power, virtue, operation, and effect of Christ, and by which you deny that Christ is present to his church and supper even bodily, I confess and testify to you before the Lord that you will not approve it to innumerable churches, as it cannot be confirmed by the scriptures or the testimonies of the ancient church. For the Lord testifies that he is present to the church and offers his body and blood in the sacred supper, not only his power, virtue, operation, and effect. Hence Paul confesses a communion in the sacrament not only of virtue and effect but also of the body and blood itself. And no one can express this better or more fully than the Lord himself and his Spirit. As Irenaeus, Hilary, Chrysostom, Cyril, and others explain this mystery, there is no need to remind you. But neither the heavens and the right hand of the Father nor the nature of the body of Christ (which indeed remains true in the Lord) can be defined by Scripture or the authority of the holy fathers in such a way that from that definition it can be concluded that the Lord does not present himself to us here wholly and therefore also with his body.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, concerning Luther's opinion, I confirm to you before God: although he calls the presence of Christ in the supper, which he establishes, bodily and admits it to be consistent with the confession of Berengar and the doctrine of the Sophists, excluding only transubstantiation, he finally defines it in such a way that he asserts the body of the Lord to be perceived by hands and mouth: all these things, I say, although Luther writes and preaches them, he nevertheless intends to mean nothing else by these words than that with the bread the true body of the Lord and the Lord himself is truly offered. He does not dispute the manner of this offering; he hides his mind in the faith in the obscurity of the word of the Lord. But because the Lord says of the bread he offers: "This is my body," Luther affirms that these two things, most diverse in nature, the body of the Lord and the bread, are joined and united by such a union (he calls it "sacramental") that they have such a communication of properties that those things are rightly attributed to the body which properly belong not to the body but to the bread, so that, as Paul rightly says, the body of the Lord is broken, which is a property of the bread, so it is also a proper expression to say that the body of the Lord is touched, ground by the teeth, eaten. And it is certain that the holy fathers often used this communication of properties. In this way, Luther himself explains his words in his great confession and explicitly confesses that none of these sufferings, which happen to the bread, happen to the body of Christ in itself; but because these things happen to the bread by which the body of Christ is offered and to which the Lord, by offering it, said: "This is my body," he wants the same things to be able to be attributed to the body by the words of Scripture because of the sacramental union, just as the evangelist attributes to the Holy Spirit what properly belonged to the form of a dove. For he writes that John saw the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove when he saw the form of a dove by which the Holy Spirit presented himself.</p>
      <p>To this sense, when he understands the confession of Berengar, he approves it, and since the Sophists do not establish any local, any presence of this world of the Lord in the supper, but only a certain secret relation (thus Thomas Aquinas speaks) of the body of the Lord to the form of the bread, so that the body of Christ is considered present, whose presence, however, is perceived not by sense, not by reason, but only by faith: it does not appear what, besides transubstantiation and the permanence of the body of the Lord with the symbol of the bread outside the use of the sacrament instituted by Christ (which fiction they have devised much more perniciously than transubstantiation), should be criticized in the opinion of the Sophists concerning the presence of the Lord in the Eucharist. Concerning the other false dogma of theirs about the permanence of Christ with the symbol, Luther disagrees with the papists no less than in the former about transubstantiation. I have perceived this explanation of the Lutheran opinion from the mouth and writings of Luther in such a way that I would willingly swear that he thinks so and not otherwise, and many certainly learned and pious men in innumerable churches do not doubt that he thinks so. Since, therefore, nothing more than a certain true and real offering of Christ in the supper is simply asserted by him, and no mode of it is posited, I do not see what definition of either the body of Christ or the heavenly glory into which Christ has been taken from this world you can bring from the scriptures with which the presence and eating of Christ, affirmed so simply and also explained in this way, could conflict, so that it cannot be considered of this world. For Luther clearly preaches that neither the sense nor the reason of this world, but only that mind and reason which, having overcome this world, as it has been lifted up to Christ in the supercelestial, can reach it. I therefore pray the Lord to guide and enlighten your mind in this dispute, so that you may seek and bring solid and genuine definitions of the body of Christ, the world which the Lord has left, the heavens into which he has received himself, his session and station at the right hand of the Father, the offering, presence, and eating of Christ from his word and no human thoughts, no visions of your own reason. It is the cause of Christ that you will plead, and you will plead it against a man certainly not of ordinary genius and acumen, with whom also innumerable churches, to whom their gifts are not ordinary, are in agreement.</p>
      <p>Remember also that you must require from yourself concerning all that you affirm or deny a certain and clear word of God, from which what you wish is not only seen to be concluded but is concluded and demonstrated in reality. For if you define the heavenly glory of Christ in such a way that you place in it the circumscription of place, which is a thing of this world, you will be required to show the word of God by which this is taught. Now, who among men has been above all the heavens? Who has explained to us the condition of that world beyond the world? Then, even if it is granted that Christ is circumscribed in a certain place of the heavens, which Augustine and Fulgentius seem to affirm (whose authority, however, as of men, will not be given place in this theological dispute): by what oracle of Scripture will it be shown that it is impossible for Christ, existing and remaining in that very heavenly place of his, to present himself to his church and his supper and to present himself and his body, not only by his power and work, but by the presence which his words testify, not that of this world, which the sense or reason of this world perceives, but ultramundane, which only heavenly reason can perceive, yet also such a presence which by the miracle of divine kindness, as also the tasting of the heavenly gift and the participation of the Holy Spirit, of which to the Hebrews 6, can happen even to unworthy Christians?</p>
      <p>You bring up the place of Paul 1 Cor. 15 concerning the heavenly and spiritual condition of our bodies, which are to be conformed to the body of Christ, already bearing the image of the heavenly Adam. But since you do not have this very condition of our bodies, what it will be like, explained, what will you gather from it? Peter also walked on the water in his mortal condition at the command of the Lord, which, however, does not agree with the nature of the body, as we indeed know it. Moses and Elijah were also seen with the Lord in the body on Mount Tabor. Who now knows whether the Lord could not then and can today present them and any others present to all men in the world no less than he then presented them to his disciples? Then, who does not attribute more of the divine condition to the body of Christ united with the word of God in the same hypostasis, even with the whole nature of man preserved, than to our bodies even reborn? Likeness does not immediately bring equality of power and amplitude. Stephen saw the Lord standing at the right hand of God and thus had him present to himself. Could not the Lord then have presented himself in this way to all men throughout the world? And since he can present himself in this way to the eyes of the body, who cannot also do so in the sacred supper to the eyes of faith through the mirror and enigma of his word and symbols? But if he can do this, as he certainly can - for it does not conflict with the truth of either the divine or human nature in him, since there is no place in Scripture by which it can be proved that those words "take, eat; this is my body, etc." are not the words of the Lord, offering with that bread his body and himself - how will you demonstrate that it is necessary to understand those words of the Lord in this way: take and eat; this is the power and operation of my body? But if you do not demonstrate that it is necessary by the necessity of faith to interpret those words of the Lord in this way, it will be attributed to irreligious audacity to impose this interpretation against the perpetual consensus of the church. For you know that axiom: Scripture is to be understood in the most natural and simple sense (for God speaks with his people popularly), where nothing repels from the simplicity of the sentence that conflicts with the entire doctrine of Christ or with the chief and confessed dogmas among all the pious. Certainly, truly religious men, who tremble at the word of the Lord, will be led by no authority but the word of God to sustain believing and speaking otherwise about these mysteries than the words of the Lord and Paul and the perpetual sense of the ancient church have. But the words are clear: "Take, eat, this is my body, which is given for you"; likewise: "The bread which we break is the communion of the body of Christ." For you will not bring forth any similar speech from all of Scripture in which something is mentioned to be or to be given through signs, so that what the words express is not given or is not given in reality. Exhibitive speeches, by which something is given through sensible signs, such as this one: "Take and eat, etc.," will be required; bringing assimilative speeches, by which one thing is only affirmed to be similar to another, will not suffice. Circumcision is called a covenant, and when it was rightly performed and received, a real covenant with the circumcised was established. Jeroboam was also given the ten tribes to rule through the sign of the ten parts of the torn cloak in reality. Also, the sacrifice of the religious Passover, when performed, exhibited this very benefit of passing over the deserved vengeance of God. No one will deny that the bread, the sign of the body of the Lord, is not the body itself, nor will they bear you making many words about this. But to prove from the scriptures that this sign is not given and received truly and in reality the body of the Lord, you will be required to prove with clear and explicit scriptures. That communion of the body of the Lord, which Paul preaches, as your people once defined, is held in memory. But since Paul defines it as such, by which we are one bread, one body in the Lord, the definition of your people will not be admitted, which even Oecolampadius did not approve.</p>
      <p>Thus, if you define Christ to be present in the supper bodily or his bodily presence in the supper (which presence you say is affirmed by Luther, denied by you) to be such a presence that is local, of this world, detracts from the truth of the human and bodily nature in Christ or his heavenly glory, many will turn away from you as slanderers of Luther, as those who know that Luther and those who agree with him, when they use these words, posit nothing of bodily presence beyond what is affirmed and expressed by the Lord himself and his apostle with these words: "This is my body, it is the communion of the body of the Lord, he is guilty of the body of the Lord" and "discerns the body of the Lord." And they will hold this syllogism with clasped hands: what is given by the Lord and received from his hands and eaten and whose communion is perceived and had, is present to those to whom it is given and who receive it and have its communion, they also have its presence. Then they will urge that he who speaks with the very words of the Lord about such great mysteries cannot speak wrongly. Finally, how can the word "bodily" or "bodily" be condemned in this matter, when Paul dared to write that the divinity dwells in Christ bodily? For to be or to dwell bodily is more dissident from the divinity than from the body of Christ. I have not, most excellent men, irreligiously dealt with this matter for so many years; for I know that it is an abomination to the Lord for anyone to make a pretense in his doctrine or to play. I have examined what has been brought forth on both sides not carelessly; but from the words of the Lord and the perpetual consensus of the church from the apostles, I have learned, by the grace of the Lord, that there is no place in Scripture that contradicts or conflicts with that presence of the Lord in the sacred supper, which Luther truly posits, I do not say seems to posit to most. Therefore, my Bullinger, I urge you in the Lord to consider well the majesty of the word of God, the necessity of the churches, the dignity of your ministry, and to be careful not to appear either irreverent to the word of God or a slanderer of its ministers.</p>
      <p>You object, to respond to this in passing, that I opposed Luther's opinion in the Bern Disputation with you. No one knows better than I what I opposed in this or other disputations: certainly no other than that which is of this world, such as I feared might be introduced by the cruder formulas of Luther and others, although I hesitated about their opinion and could not in my mind determine that they imagined something so crude about the Lord. I asserted a spiritual presence, but true and real and of the body of the Lord itself, not only of his power and work. - You also object to the authority of Oecolampadius and Zwingli, to whose ministry I have always attributed much, as I have also publicly testified and testify today. However, I know that Oecolampadius was plainly in the opinion I follow, as he also publicly testified in his Dialogue, not to mention what he privately testified to me by word and hand. Zwingli also handled the matter in such a way, responding to Eck, that he seemed to me to confess not only the power of Christ but also the presence of Christ himself. Certainly, I see both of them only fighting against that bodily presence of the Lord in the supper, which comprehends something of place and condition of this world. But that Luther does not now again believe this is not surprising, since you do not attribute this opinion to those men. A fatal temptation fascinates many on both sides, so that they imagine controversies where in reality there is either none or not so great. Now concerning Luther himself and his book. As for Luther himself, see, my Bullinger, that you do not reject something of Christ in him because of human offense. You should weigh these things with a serene and religious mind: whom the Lord first and still has willed to break the tyranny of the Antichrist with the sole trust in Christ, without any support of the flesh, by public writings and deeds both more strongly and more successfully? Whom has he willed to restore the preaching of true repentance and pure faith in Christ and the true fruits of faith to the world with more powerful and celebrated sermons and writings? Whom has he willed to translate and expound the sacred Scripture into our language with greater felicity and grace? Whom has he willed to restore more churches to the gospel of Christ through various regions? Whom finally, in whom also his gospel is more fiercely attacked by the Antichrists and triumphs more gloriously? May God grant you to consider and perceive these things as they are with the true judgment of the Spirit, not with disdain or offense of the flesh. He has his faults both in life and in writings; but who is entirely free from faults? The Lord has bestowed many heroic things upon him, so that in his humility the glory of divine mercy may become more illustrious; he is not without some very eminent faults. Yet this also must be considered: concerning his faults, who seems to have harmed us, our judgment ought to be suspect to us. For who does not both in himself and in others either praise or overlook many things which others rightly consider faults, worthy of not ordinary censure? And on the contrary: how many things seem to us to be faults in others, which they consider either praiseworthy or unworthy to be noted? And this diversity of judgments exists even among those whom no offense makes more unjust.</p>
      <p>If you say he is bold and offensive even at times in the interpretation and exposition of the scriptures: whose writings, either of the ancients or the recent ones, will you pronounce free from these faults? And unless you overlook many things out of reverence for the outstanding gifts of the Lord, how many of the ancients would you endure to read only in the expositions of the Old Testament? In Erasmus, who nevertheless dared to oppose the cause of Christ, how many things did you overlook because of the excellent benefits he brought to the churches with his writings? To criticize and condemn others, Luther is both more prone and more severe than just. Let us compare our own in the Anabaptists and consider how much Luther's vehemence against the papists pleased us all; let the variety of minds and even the excesses, which are usually pardoned to great men, be considered. He does not doubt that he is fighting against those who prefer the visions of their reason to the word of God and who seek to overthrow the true ministry of Christ with deceit, insults, and injuries. Therefore, he says and writes against you things which you also admit are lesser than these great crimes; it is indeed very regrettable that he allowed himself to be persuaded of this opinion about you. This is a fatal temptation from the Lord; but it is also very regrettable that when that persuasion was repelled by your confession, it was so recalled by your not necessary words and writings. Desired were the halcyon days through the churches when you sent your Basel confession and its interpretation to Luther; but when later not similar writings were both published and written by you, when in private letters you were portrayed as victors in this cause, he as defeated, when it was boasted that Luther had not been added to: by these things indeed that grave persuasion was recalled. But the reputation of both you and your people, who have deserved well of the church of Christ, was to be vindicated. True; but as far as that vindication contributes to the salvation of the churches and the glory of Christ and how much the Lord wants that very reputation of yours and your people's to be vindicated by that effort of yours. I am indeed certain before the Lord: if you had wanted to foster and cultivate that tranquility and whatever concord after presenting that confession of yours to Luther, and to live quietly about this dispute, which was brought to that point to which it could be brought and so explained that it could not be explained further, that is, if you had not published writings contrary to your confession and by handling the matter of the Eucharist still attacked some adversaries who state an unworthy presence of the Lord, and thus tacitly censured Luther, finally, if you had not spread anything about Luther and the matter of concord in private letters more unjustly -: if you had decided to refrain from these things, the reputation of both you and your people would undoubtedly be much greater and more gracious today throughout all the churches, which was somewhat damaged by that prelude to restoring the fight and now, with the fight recalled, will be most gravely attacked by many. To these things, what else but the gravest scandals have been and will be objected to the churches of Christ, such scandals indeed that I would rather my name and those of mine be held so execrable that it could not be more than to bear the conscience of such great scandals. Indeed, we servants of the Lord must exercise great religion not to reject fellow servants whom their and our Lord has assumed. He sins greatly in this. Therefore, we must avoid falling into the same evil ourselves. Whoever invades the judgment that the Father has given entirely to his Son obliges himself to divine majesty. Take these things written to you by me in good part. Woe if I bear false witness against the servants of the Lord! But I must recognize Luther as a son and servant of the Lord, unless I do not want to judge him according to the word of the Lord from his fruits known to me. Therefore, what I have persuaded myself of him, following the word of the Lord, if I did not profess it where I see the contrary judged of him, I would certainly bind myself to false testimony concerning the servant of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Now concerning the writing, which you call furious, yet you write that you have not yet read it. It is indeed - alas! - too bitter. For in it, he condemns with anathema all those who, having been sufficiently warned, do not want to believe that the bread of the Lord in the supper is the true and natural body of the Lord and that the impious or Judas equally receives it with the mouth as St. Peter and all the saints; and among those whom he thus condemns, he undoubtedly numbers you, although he still spares your names. This, I say, seems to me a very bitter and untimely judgment; not that I do not also feel that those who obstinately do not want to believe that Christ offers himself and his body with this bread of his and offers it to all to whom this bread is to be offered by the institution of the Lord, also perceive this with the mouth, that is, with the sacrament, which they take with the mouth, and as far as the sacrament, whoever accommodates faith to these words and institution of the Lord and does not impiously pervert or remake it. For they have so much faith in the Lord that they feel not only the sign of the body of the Lord or simple bread but also the body of the Lord is offered to them with the sacrament; therefore, they also perceive it in the sacrament. But if they do not do this with grateful religion, in which the Corinthians sinned, not discerning the body of the Lord, they make themselves guilty of the body, which they take unworthily. Therefore, these people perceive the food of life only with the mouth and the external man, not also with the sense of living faith and the enjoyment of the new man. I indeed also feel these things in this way. But Luther's words are too general and precise. But because he has explained these words of his elsewhere and because he has undertaken to vindicate the simplicity of faith in the word of the Lord concerning the integrity of the sacrament, in which not only bread but also the body of the Lord is offered, he speaks thus, he proposes the matter in this way. I confess that this is indeed too akin to the impious and pernicious comment of the papists concerning the permanence of Christ in the symbols, even outside the use instituted by him. But what shall I do? I know what I wish; I am ready for what I can.</p>
      <p>Why then, you say, do you bear him speaking so precisely and in defense of errors? The answer is at hand: my place in the church is to be maintained, nor is it right to usurp anything that the Lord has not given me. Luther had already been brought to a suitable explanation of such words when we had assured him that you do not confess empty bread, but with this also the communion of the body of Christ in the sacred supper, as your Basel confession clearly states. If this opinion of you had not been removed from him again by your writings and letters, he would have progressed to a fuller explanation of this whole mystery. But when he seems to himself to feel that there are those who try to abuse his elucidation of such words to make him akin to that opinion which does not consider Christ to be offered in the sacred supper but only the symbols of the absent, he immediately withdraws himself as much as he can into the obscurity of the word of Christ and expresses and asserts the presence and offering of the body of Christ as grossly as he can, that is, as it seems to him, as fully as possible. - He affirms that the bread itself is the body of the Lord, which, however, he elsewhere admits to be different in nature from the body of Christ and only preaches to be united with the body of the Lord sacramentally. He also says that the body of the Lord is taken by all who take his bread, which, however, he elsewhere and in the articles of concord has restricted to those only who do not pervert the words and institution of the Lord with false interpretation. And while he remains in that persuasion, so that he thinks that the true presence and offering of the body of Christ in the supper is sought, as he does not doubt, Satan is trying to do this, so that, with this single place of Scripture admitted to the impious audacity of our reason, soon with the same audacity gradually strengthened, he may overthrow all the chief dogmas of Scripture, he does not bear those who try to moderate this his more vehement and gross affirmation of the presence and offering of the Lord in the supper; for if anyone, however dear and pleasing he may be, should attempt it improperly, he would achieve nothing else than to make his hard confession even much harder. Such is he, such has the Lord given him to us, such does the Lord himself use him and to such splendid and eminent testimonies of his Son. What then shall I do, miserable worm and unprofitable servant? Shall I cast him out of the kingdom of the Lord, whom the Lord himself has placed in it at such a great distance above me and whom so many churches of God also regard as placed in such a high place? You know that excommunication is attempted perniciously even against confessed flagrant offenses when it cannot be decreed, but not even approved by all the rest gathered in the church in the name of Christ and consenting with the apostolic spirit, instituting and compelling this judgment.</p>
      <p>To me, this is also indubitable, and many who otherwise greatly disagree with you feel with me in this: that there can be those who do not rightly feel about the confession of the presence of the Lord in the sacred supper, who nevertheless retain the foundation of Christ, who simply by the infirmity of judgment cannot see that this presence, which is posited by Luther, does not contradict those places of Scripture which preach that Christ has left this world and has received himself into the heavens. Indeed, I would rather endure anything than to consign you, whom I do not doubt to hold an opinion about the Eucharist not consistent with the word of God, to Satan for that reason; for I have no cause to judge that you obstinately prefer your comments to the word of God. Therefore, in these and many other matters, many do not agree with Luther; yet, while we rightly admire such great gifts and works of Christ in him, we cover, overlook, and minimize what we judge to be foreign to him for the glory of Christ and the edification of his church, as we recognize that we owe this to any members of Christ, much less to one so preeminent.</p>
      <p>While we thus extol Luther with such praises, minimize and cover his faults, impose no restraint on his ferocity, you fear that we have made him so insolent with this preposterous zeal. You must indeed be very ignorant of Luther's nature to think that human praises can either elevate or depress his mind much. But whatever you wish to decide about either Luther himself or us, his praisers, you will see for yourself. I dare to affirm this to you about myself: whatever I praise, whatever I purify, minimize, overlook, bear in him, I have this one purpose, that I may conduct myself towards him and with the gifts of the Lord in him, as well as his faults, in such a way that I consider it to be in the interest of the churches and can be approved by Christ the Lord. Furthermore, as you seem to want to defend against Luther's writing what is in Zwingli's book, not published by him but by you, where Hercules, Numa, Scipio, the Catos, all the ancestors of the kings of the Franks, etc., are joined with Christ and the apostles in heaven, I confess to you that I am greatly disturbed by this matter, not because you seem to affirm that I was also of this opinion (for I will easily clear myself of that), but because you are about to expose your ministry and your church to the gravest accusation of all the saints with this attempt. In my Commentaries and elsewhere, I have professed this opinion: that I do not doubt that God has imbued some among the nations with true worship of himself, among whom Job is numbered; but that I would attribute to any pagans, concerning whose faith in Christ I have no certain testimony, the fellowship of blessed life in heaven with Christ and those saints whom I know to have been translated there from certain scriptural testimonies, I have always been far from that. God did not do so with every nation; his peculiar people was Israel from all the nations. Those who are to be counted among the church of God and confess and worship God in it are to be joined to Christ in this way. I therefore ask you in the Lord and by the majesty of his kingdom, which he has defined by his word and sacraments and certain discipline, and by the greatness of your ministry and your most splendid church, I beseech and adjure you, since you are about to give more than enough offense and harm to the churches by defending the opinion which you profess in your letters to me about the Eucharist, not to add to these things the scandal of this truly horrendous dogma. For where this defense of yours of that dogma can be carried by many, how you favor the dogma of the Epicureans, of whom there are innumerable today everywhere, by which they assign the salvation of Christ to all who live civilly well, even if they entirely neglect the true churches or even adhere to the external ceremonies of the pope or the Turk? Finally, to respond about myself: you urge me to abandon the hope and effort for concord, in which I experience myself to be playing my effort and expense, and you wish this matter had never been begun; finally, you seem to announce that you will mention in your response to Luther's writing both me and the things I have done with you in the effort for concord. As for my attempt and labors to restore concord among the churches in the doctrine of the Eucharist, I give great thanks to our Lord Jesus Christ that he has so splendidly blessed this my attempt, this work, these efforts of mine and has brought this concord to that point and still preserves it. For there is no church outside the Swiss borders that does not persist in this agreement made at Wittenberg; for although the church of Constance alone did not subscribe to those articles, yet I do not hear that it teaches otherwise than is contained in those articles, as far as the main point is concerned, that in the sacred supper Christ himself is perceived by the faithful, not only his operation, much less empty symbols. Certainly among you, after I saw that you do not adhere to the Basel confession, except in the sense which the words provide and which is necessarily required to establish concord with Luther and the churches that agree with him, I ceased to roll this stone for so many years.</p>
      <p>But what I recently touched upon in letters to you, I certainly did not do with any hope of obtaining from you that you would concede to the opinion which we do not doubt to be of the Lord, but to make you more hesitant and cautious about renewing the fight on this matter if I could. For I have always clearly testified to you that Luther has never departed from his opinion about the presence and offering of the Lord in the sacred supper and will never depart from it, nor will he acknowledge anyone as a brother who does not want to be in the same opinion with him, and for that reason, to restore concord with him, it is plainly necessary that it be believed and expressly stated that in the sacred supper not only empty symbols nor only the operation of Christ, but Christ himself and his true body are truly and in reality offered and perceived with the symbol. But if this were granted to him, he would easily bear that any church should use those forms of speaking about this mystery by which it could most conveniently explain and make plain this truth to its people. Since I also heard that you do not want to establish empty symbols in the sacred supper, but also acknowledge that the body of the Lord itself, not only his work, is given and received by the faithful, I said that there is no more difference between you and him than there is between those of whom one affirms that an animal is coming, which he sees coming from afar and more obscurely than he can recognize it as a man, while the other, because he sees further and certainly sees that it is a man who is coming, says that a man is coming. Between these two, there is certainly no contradiction; for it does not conflict: an animal is coming, a man is coming. Thus I said that Luther affirms that simply the body of the Lord is given and perceived in the sacred supper, but concerning the manner in which it is given and perceived, he disputes nothing at all, so that others may explain the manner of this presence in such a way that the true presence and perception of the Lord is not removed by that explanation, he does not object to it being said, namely: that the body of the Lord is not perceived and eaten in itself here; not touched by natural sense or reason, but only by a mind instructed by faith; that Christ is not detracted from his heavenly glory, but in that very glory is offered here through the mirror and enigma of words and symbols; that it is to be seen, handled, and eaten only by the eyes of the new man. It therefore seemed to me that in this way there is a difference between you, so that when Luther says that simply the body of Christ is offered and taken with the bread in the sacred supper, you say that the body of the Lord is given and received with the bread, but without the local inclusion of the body of Christ in the bread, without the natural mixture of it with the bread, not so that it becomes food for the stomach. Now these do not conflict: the body of Christ is truly offered and perceived in the sacred supper, and: it is offered and perceived in no way of this world, but in a secret manner, competent to the new man, offered to us so that we may remain and live more in him and he in us.</p>
      <p>For in the Basel confession it is expressly stated that the Lord gives his body and blood, that is, himself, truly to his own; likewise, that through the symbols by the ministry of the church a true communion of his body and blood is offered. I remember that you Zurichers were very reluctantly persuaded to give this confession; yet because you gave it, being such great men in the administration of religion, I certainly conceived the hope of establishing concord throughout all Germany, sometimes indeed wavering in that hope. But when I noticed that you were completely changed before and at the last assembly held among you, I committed you to the Lord. And although we were then treated with the gravest injuries and insults, the excellent Capito and I, in your city, you not seeming to be very angry about it - for you yourself did not commend us to your people as brothers in your sermon; I omit the rumors spread throughout the city before our arrival, while we were there, and after our departure; I omit what was also written and reported from there against us, many things indeed unfriendly and not brotherly -, yet we have forgiven all to the Lord and the tranquility of the churches and your splendid gifts with which the Lord has adorned you, and we have persisted in true love, zeal, and respect for you, completely overlooking what rightly offended. We will do the same in the future. Therefore, as far as you are concerned, I have long since done what you ask: I have abandoned the attempt to reconcile you with Luther in this matter and to reconcile your opinion (this one which you now clearly profess) and Luther's opinion, which I have never seen could be done. Among others, however, to whom the Lord has prepared more hearing for me for his kingdom, I will not cease to foster and preserve the concord, which by his singular favor and my not ordinary zeal and labor (to him be thanks, who gave this) has been happily established, as long as it is allowed. As for your wish that this matter had never been begun, you will see for yourself. I indeed congratulate the churches of Christ that most learned and holy men and so many churches are of a different wish.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, concerning your discussion of mentioning me in your response, I earnestly ask you and by Christ and his church and all the love you retain towards me, I beseech and implore you to do what Luther did: namely, not to add even a word about me and all that business which I undertook for the concord of the churches to your response to Luther; for you have not yet judged about my zeal and purpose, which I had, nor about my actions, which I have completed in this cause, what I know must be judged by you before the Lord. Therefore, if you mention anything about me and my actions for concord and repairing it among you, I see that you will do it in such a way that I will have to contradict you publicly. This matter was more important to me than to you; I remember more; your writings and Luther's exist, and there are testimonies in Basel and elsewhere. Therefore, if I cannot persuade you to make no mention at all of me and the whole business I conducted with you, as you see, Luther made no mention, I cannot interpret it otherwise than that you do not consider it enough to have Luther and with him plainly many as antagonists, but you wish to set up some trophy of your victory over me and those who with me otherwise miserable and afflicted churches strive to spare from these contentions. And indeed, these days it has been reported to me that you once judged me worthy to be beaten for a feigned concord. But I have never done anything feigned; I have faithfully reported what opinion stood on both sides. I advised that concord be established in that which I did not doubt both should and could be established: that we should confess on both sides that with the symbols the true body of the Lord is truly given and perceived, and that each should explain the manner for the edification of his church. However, with you, because you did not simply accept the articles of concord made at Wittenberg, nothing else was established than what Luther himself wrote to your magistrates. Therefore, I see no reason at all why it should be fitting for you to mention me. I therefore ask and beseech you not to involve me in this fight in any way. That I may ask you this is in my hand; that I may also persuade you, may Christ grant, who will also grant that if you drag me into this fight against my will and reluctance, yet I may so extricate myself, or rather the Lord himself may extricate me, that I may easily approve my zeal and labors for the peace of the churches to his churches. Which matter, as it will present me with some new labor and hinder me in better things, so it will certainly bring you neither glory nor advantage. For who does not see that if you drag me into this cause, so greatly deprecating it, into it, when Luther has given you no occasion for this, not even mentioning me or the business conducted by me for concord with a word, you will not have been mindful of your duty either to the church of Christ or to me? For many have a clear view of what and how not light matters and wars I am involved and occupied with for the church of God against common enemies in Cologne and elsewhere, how also I am sincerely zealous and observant of you and yours; then, since it is not in the interest of the church to increase the number of combatants, especially at this time, I do not think you doubt. But without a new contest, I do not see how you can mention me and the things I have done with you for concord. For as with you, so before the church, I will have to testify what I think and how you have accommodated yourselves to concord. You want to appear to be able to bear those who dissent from you in this cause, who agree with you in the other doctrines of Christ. Therefore, bear also me, who bear and love and honor you in the Lord, and do not think that I abhor this fight so much either out of fear or favor of men. For why I so abhor this war, these are the reasons: I have seen and perceived everywhere what the dissensions of those ministering to the churches, both in general and especially that about this sacrament of communion with Christ, cause in the churches. They miserably cast down the authority of all administering the gospel of Christ among all; they confirm the chief argument of the adversaries, by which they persuade the common people that we do not act from the spirit of Christ, who suggests such doctrine. They render the entire doctrine of Christ suspect to many who are more lax in religion, after they see that even the most learned and best in the churches cannot come to the same opinion from the scriptures, and that about a sacrament which all Christians ought to both take and understand. They increase the disdain for the doctrine of Christ daily among the more lukewarm, they miserably disturb the consciences of many of the more ardent, they keep innumerable people entirely away from the Lord's table, by which they gradually alienate them from all communion and discipline of the church and join them to Epicureanism. And how much Satan has attempted through this ecclesiastical dissension to introduce even civil distraction in Germany and by this occasion to oppress all those zealous for the gospel, I know better than you; for nothing has often been closer than that your dogma should be condemned by a public decree of the empire. What Antichrist is now about to attempt at these diets, from which he otherwise fears a little more for himself, and how much this opportunity is offered to him to prevent the true religion of Christ from receiving more freedom, I foresee so that I shudder entirely at the thought. These, my Bullinger, and no private causes compel me to strive, as far as it is allowed, to withdraw both myself and all who listen to me from all contention among our people. You cast the cause of the renewed contest on Luther, he on you. But Luther has given too much cause. Yet, since everything must be subordinated to the churches, Dr. Philip in letters to me and many others wish that you do not respond to him even thus provoked, especially at this time. I do not insist (which I would do in vain) that you remain completely silent, yet I have previously written to you how I would wish you to moderate your response.</p>
      <p>That I should write these things to you was indeed extorted from me, not a little reluctant (for I have long known how these things of mine fall with you), by the religion of my duty, the zeal of Christ and his churches, and that anxious consideration of both the dangers and scandals which I understand remain for the churches from this renewed contest. Therefore, I ask you by Christ to take these things in good part or bear them tolerantly. Thus I am, thus the Lord has given me to be, thus I wish to appear before the tribunal of Christ, which we will both soon approach. Let the agreement between us persist in those things in which Christ has granted it; in other things, let us bear with one another according to that law of the Spirit which is described in Romans 15. Let us love and help one another in those things in which it has been granted to us to see the same, which are many and in the primary religion. Let those who consider themselves stronger support the weaker, and let us cut off and avoid all occasions of further dissension and offense, as far as is permitted by God, on both sides. I wish you well in the Lord and to inform me as soon as possible whether you are willing to grant me, if not a veteran and worthy of a rude dismissal, yet occupied in another more necessary war of the Lord, a release from your war, which is certainly not necessary or at least not so necessary. May the Lord Jesus guide and lead your efforts to the true benefit of his church. Amen.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, December 13, 1544.</p>
      <p>Martin Bucer, yours in the Lord, as always.</p>
      <p>I give great thanks to your Charity for your diligence shown to me, indeed to that most excellent prince, concerning the indices of books. I wish that an opportunity may be given to you for your good, so that I may be able to declare my gratitude towards you with some not ordinary service.</p>
