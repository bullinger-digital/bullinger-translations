      <p>Greetings. I have often congratulated myself, most learned man, that during the journey of my undertaken pilgrimage, I had the opportunity to converse with you; for the benevolence and incomparable humanity of which we heard preached, we have experienced in reality, and we will perpetually celebrate among people who think well or otherwise of you. Many perhaps think less of us because of the unpleasantness and harshness of the air of our homeland; but you, who accept everything candidly, I do not doubt, will give each their due place, so as not to pass a harsher judgment on anyone because of some trivial impediments. Therefore, I give you immense thanks, for you have remembered me and kindly greeted me in the letters of my friend Mr. Erhard von Künheim.</p>
      <p>Although my duties cannot be so great as to repay your readiness in equal measure, I nevertheless promise to make every effort to contribute whatever ability I have to embrace your authority.</p>
      <p>What you write about your church, school, republic, and economy being quite prosperous, I indeed congratulate you and pray to God that He may kindly protect you in the future and grant you some peaceful abodes. Among us, there is a horrible fury of conflict, and what is most lamentable, Christians are destroying each other with mutual wounds for the sake of the impious.</p>
      <p>Magdeburg is besieged on all sides; Prince Moritz and the confederates have thirty cohorts of infantry and several squadrons of cavalry. Great slaughters occur on both sides, and the townspeople conduct themselves bravely, deprived of all assistance from others; for the Saxon army was dispersed by fraud and secret cunning, not by arms or force. May God, the eternal Father, grant that these regions enjoy peace and that heavenly doctrine is preserved! Among us, by God's grace, the same voice of teaching sounds as before, and the studies of literature also flourish.</p>
      <p>May your humanity fare well, and if at any time leisure permits, I respectfully request that you deign to inform me of all matters in return, than which nothing can be more pleasing to me. I would have gladly written to the most distinguished Mr. Bibliander, had time not failed me; I beg you again and again to greet him on my behalf with due respect. Given in Wittenberg in Saxony.</p>
      <p>Friedrich von Fölkersam, from Livonia.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, outstanding in piety and doctrine, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful professor of sacred theology at the University of Zürich, my lord and esteemed friend.</p>
      <p>Friedrich von Fölkersam, from Livonia.</p>
