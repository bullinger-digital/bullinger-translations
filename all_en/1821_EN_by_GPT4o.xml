      <p> Greetings. We have received your letter, most courteous man, in which you reply to Vergerio and complain to us about the pernicious stubbornness of our people. Certainly, they are cruelly greedy towards themselves, as they prefer to lack good pastors rather than count those by whom they could live. Oh, the ingratitude of men! To whom they once liberally gave a hundred gold crowns for lies, they now grudgingly pay twenty for the truth they preach. We indeed proclaim this everywhere and, in whatever ways we can and whenever possible, we impress upon everyone that soon they will have neither preachers nor messengers; but, as the saying goes, we tell a story to the deaf. Some indeed send their children to school, but so that they may learn to read and write their accounts; very few desire their children to be educated in the good arts. Nevertheless, we will not cease to admonish our communities. We repeat what we have said to you before, as we have nothing else to write now, yet you wish to have some response. - We have prepared certain statutes of our synod, which Vergerio and the Italians among us strongly oppose. All our local brothers ask that you read them and, if you think anything should be amended, advise us. We are not sending them to you at this time, sparing your health, as perhaps you have not yet fully recovered; however, we will send them as soon as we learn you have become stronger. Do not be deterred by the size of the booklet. It demands barely a day's effort; for in two hours you can read through it all, indeed in less time. - As soon as I received Vergerio's letters from you, I sent them to Johannes Travers, who would deliver them to him along with others we wrote to Vergerio in aid against the papists. For Vergerio had withdrawn to the Engadin from the Valtellina, a man certainly more than sufficiently vehement in our judgment; thus we fear. Meanwhile, farewell in the Lord Jesus, most courteous man, and continue to love us in return. Given at Chur, on the 6th of March, in the year 1553. </p>
      <p> Of your entire integrity, Johannes Comander, Philipp Gallicius. </p>
      <p> After we wrote this letter, it was certainly announced that the envoy of the King of the French here, Mr. Johannes Jacobus Castiglione, has died, and indeed he is dead. They say he will be taken from our city to his castle for burial tomorrow. </p>
      <p> Truly to the great man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother. </p>
      <p> ZÃ¼rich. </p>
