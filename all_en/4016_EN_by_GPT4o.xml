      <p>Praise be to God! Strasbourg, July 10, 1559.</p>
      <p>My willing service and all the best to you, gracious lord. I have received your letter dated June 24, written in Latin, by the bearer of this letter, Jerg Mayer from Zurich, which included a letter to Hans Rodolff in Marburg; I have sent it to a good friend in Frankfurt, as I sent your last one; I hope it will be delivered well. Regarding the painter, I thank you diligently for allowing me to have your portrait; in 14 days, I will send my servant Thoma to you in Zurich; he will bring the remaining money for the painter with him. I had thought that I would soon leave here with my wife and in good health; but now, for several reasons, I want to stay here until the Frankfurt fair. Therefore, when they are sent there, they will surely come to me.</p>
      <p>Regarding news from England, we have that 6 papist bishops were deposed from their bishoprics on the 21st of last month because they refused to swear loyalty and allegiance to the king, but rather to their idol, the Antichrist.</p>
      <p>More will soon follow.</p>
      <p>I have recently received letters from England, written on the 25th of last month, in which they write to me that the cruel, idolatrous, and devilish mass has been completely abolished, and they have their old books and practices in religion, as it was in King Edward's time, and it is hoped that everything will be good. May God grant and his grace be thanked. Amen.</p>
      <p>Greet my good lord and father Dr. Peter Martyr and give him this enclosed letter; I believe he will find something good in it. Greet Mr. Gwalter, my good lord and friend, along with his dear wife, and I wish your son and his daughter much happiness and well-being in body and soul, and wherever I can be of service to you or them, I will gladly do so from the heart. May the grace of God be with you all.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant always, Johann Abel, Englishman.</p>
      <p>On the 12th of the said month, I received your letter dated the 5th of the said month, written in Latin, which I cannot understand as well as your German writing. I have sent you with the bearer of this letter 2 goats; I ask you to accept them kindly. I will send this your last letter to your son with the next messenger, with God's help. To the worthy and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my gracious lord and friend in Zurich.</p>
