    <p xml:id="regest1">The concerned discussions in the run-up to the Diet of Schmalkalden are outdated: The planned council was rejected, with Luther and Philipp [Melanchthon] particularly contributing to the unanimous condemnation of the Pope as the Antichrist. Luther has recovered from a severe illness. Thanks to his willingness to communicate, the concord issue was also resolved; they have settled for the approval of the Augsburg Confession and the Apology and no longer insist on the signing of the [Wittenberg] Concord. The Strasbourg people might report more about Luther's favorable stance on an agreement with the Swiss, whereby the question already raised by Zwick about the conditional acceptance of the Augsburg Confession could be posed again; above all, a split among the Swiss must be avoided, and the people of Zurich must not provoke Luther by publishing a writing by Theodor [Bibliander] against Bucer. Zwick encloses a list of the participants of the Bundestag. Greetings. [Enclosure:] Reports confidentially on Bucer's attempt to justify his concord efforts and to ensure that no further unrest arises from it; the restraint of the people of Konstanz has proven to be correct. The Emperor was unexpectedly given a clear answer; the Protestant princes and cities will now probably proceed to assert their claims against the Catholic clergy. Without Luther, the theological discussions, in Ambrosius [Blarer]'s opinion, would hardly have been so satisfactory. Zwick inquires again about the Swiss' willingness to make concessions in doctrine, although he himself finds the obligation to a common formula problematic. Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] sharply contradicted Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony] when he disliked the Swiss's talk of the "spiritual eating" [of the Lord's Supper]. Zwick fears that Bucer, despite his failures, will not give up.</p>

      <p>Salvation and peace of Christ Jesus be with you and with all dear ones!</p>
      <p>After learning about the history of the Schmalkalden assembly, dearest Bullinger of all, I understand that there is no need to respond to your previous letters. We were discussing - not without some anxiety - about seeking a council, about obeying or rejecting its decision, and other matters of this kind. However, the Lord, who never abandons His own, has put an end to all our anxieties, so that there is nothing else to write to you except that you should magnificently celebrate the majesty of God with all good people. For as far as the council is concerned, it has been concluded that it should not be sought in any way, as it is not the authority of the Pope; if, however, either he or anyone else tries to execute the council's decision, the princes have decided with the cities to defend their own against that impious violence. It has also been generally and consistently answered to the papal legate that we have hitherto thought nothing else of his kingdom than what the oracles of the prophets and apostles testify about the Antichrist. That is still our mindset. Luther, however, has gathered all the impieties of the Roman bishops into one bundle with such truth and purity that no one will fail to understand that no kingdom has ever existed more disgraceful in the world. In summary: One does not want to have anything to do with him, neither small nor great, as with the true Antichrist and with the beast, etc. These titles have greatly disturbed the legate, who believes that all of Germany is deplored and desperate because that most holy head of the church and vicar of Christ is considered and believed to be that beast and man of sin. Philipp has also written an excellent supplement, in which he too has graphically depicted the papacy in its true colors, that is, black. In this matter, therefore, Christ has freed us from much and great fear, to whom eternal thanks are due. Luther was gravely ill there, but was restored by the favor of Christ.</p>
      <p>Not less happily has the matter of concord turned out; for everything has been brought to a safe harbor. Thus the Lord regards the prayers of His own who cry out to Him. For the previous formula of concord, which has long gravely vexed us, has been established in agreement with the Saxon Confession. Besides that, nothing has been changed. But if it had not been for Luther and Philipp, not a little division could have arisen from the importunity or ardor of some. For this assembly was not without minds preposterously zealous or spirits devoid of all affections. However, Luther did not want to admit anything contentious, by whose benefit the rather perplexing matter of concord received a comic end, when we all expected a tragic one. Now we, freed from the articles and subscription, will stand by the Augsburg Confessions, which we have indeed accepted by those laws.</p>
      <p>As for what has been done about the Swiss churches, I have not yet been able to find out; for I have not yet received any letters from Ambrosius. Our legates, however, remain silent before making a report to the senate, I will not say more than is fair. Once the report is made and the writings submitted, if there is anything you wish to know, I will not keep silent. But I hear that a most honorable mention of you has been made and that Luther has very piously testified that he will receive you into the bosom of friendship, in a way I do not know. Perhaps the people of Strasbourg will bring either letters or another response. I have nothing certain. If you have received anything, please, I beg you, let us also know. Although I suspect that the question I raised with you about accepting the Augsburg Confessions was not entirely a dream. I raised the same with the people of St. Gallen, that is, with Vadianus; then I also tried to find out something from the people of Basel. You should always be entirely focused on this, that you do not become divided among yourselves. I have warned and am warning this a hundred times. Then, as I have also recently urged, do not in any way provoke Luther and thus the entire consensus of our people. For I hear that Theodor has prepared something against Bucer. Here, my brother, be careful that nothing of the sort is published, indeed that Bucer does not know, who is both skilled with the pen and not lacking in vehement wit. But if he provokes you first, then by the judgment of all good people, it will be permissible to retaliate. However, the Lord must be prayed for, that with all enmity among the learned removed, we may unite as one man against the Antichrist and the world, the most atrocious beasts.</p>
      <p>Now there is nothing that I should add, except for the list of all who were at Schmalkalden, which you have here. With whom the Lord was present, it must be ensured that we do not trust human strength more than is just, but rely entirely on divine benevolence and, as we are strong against the Pope, so in ourselves we must in every way and truly abhor the kingdom of the Antichrist. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell with the dearest brothers Pellican, Leo, Theodor, Steiner, and the rest, whom Christ may keep.</p>
      <p>Given at Constance, March 24, 1537.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and brother, I have written the letter so that you may let good brothers read it. Besides, I must whisper to you that Bucer either suppressed or dissimulated his own and after the assembly ended, he himself approached with the legates of Strasbourg the legates and ministers of our cities, and they have testified and also requested that everything he handled for the sake of concord be taken in the best way, for it was all handled in the best way, etc. Hence he also writes to me that we should dissimulate that we did not subscribe to the articles, so as not to give any occasion for further inquiry. But be it as it may, we are neither required for another answer nor for the subscription; therefore God has well warned and guided us that we have delayed so long.</p>
      <p>Also, a brave answer was given to the Emperor, which I would not have expected at all. I assume that the priests will be seized and forbidden everywhere in the lands of the evangelical princes and cities, what they have, if one might yet come to justice. But they will also do the same in return; one will be prepared for that. May God stand by justice!</p>
      <p>In the catalog of preachers, you have many strange heads, and Master Ambrosius thinks that if it had not been for Luther, it would not have gone so well anywhere.</p>
      <p>As much as concerns you, it is a question with me: If you were asked about the Saxon Confession, of which I have also written before, whether you might not accept it as far as we have accepted it, I fear you would not do it. Much less would you accept it simply and without reservation. From this arises another question with me: If you might accept it, whether it is then good and useful that all people and all churches must be bound to one thing. Some think, and it is certain, that it is good to be united with one another; but that it must be bound to one form, I do not think is entirely the best. For in this way both Christian liberty is harmed, and we are bound more than is fair to the inventions of men. I say this, therefore, whether you might not want to come to concord on the form, as you might be asked, of which I know nothing certain, that you might otherwise go friendly towards Luther.</p>
      <p>Also among other things: When the Elector read your articles and found the word "spiritual eating" etc., he showed it to the Landgrave. Then the Landgrave said openly: "Dear God, now you are not eating like a roast pig" etc.</p>
      <p>Also, Bucer should well learn that he should stand still from his practices in the future, for neither his counsel in France nor his recent concord has succeeded well. So the state is now quite unsettled. But I fear nothing worse on earth than that he will not have rest. May God be with him and us all.</p>
      <p>These things to no one but you, and after reading them, give them to Vulcan.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my heart.</p>
