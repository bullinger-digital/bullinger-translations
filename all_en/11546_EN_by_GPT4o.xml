    <p xml:id="regest1">Responds on behalf of his colleagues to the letter from the Zurichers [No. 1489]: A decision about Calvin cannot yet be made, as he is urgently needed at the negotiations that have begun in Regensburg - Grynaeus was tasked with informing the Zurichers about this. Due to their request, Hans Bock will advocate for Geneva's cause [with the council] together with [the pastors and teachers], although it is difficult for them to forgo Calvin due to the heavy workload; therefore, he writes only briefly. If public negotiations about religion are scheduled, the Zurichers should by no means oppose an invitation to participate; Melanchthon will also urge this in writing. Whether the opponents will even allow it to come to this point, the Zurichers will hear from the Baslers, to whom the people of Strasbourg will pass on all news; since this could be the last act of the tragedy, special vigilance is necessary. Greetings.</p>

      <p> Greetings. Your letter, which you wrote to us in a common name, was received with the greatest gratitude by my fellow ministers and colleagues, and they have given me the task of respectfully replying to you. In Calvin's absence, no decision can be made about his departure. For, as we instructed to be written to you through Grynaeus, they have now begun in Regensburg to consider the composition of religion and to select a few men to outline the rudiments of reformation. In this matter, his experience will be very useful. However, you will feel that your letters and authority have brought much assistance. Johann Bock will likewise join us in complying with the Genevans, even for your sake, although it is difficult to let go of such a man from us. We are old, exhausted by labors, and see very little hope in those who should roll this stone after us, and yet it is necessary to prefer the public salvation of the churches to our private one, as you prudently and piously advise. I therefore ask you to excuse to your fellow ministers, brothers, and my elders in the Lord, that I did not respond honorably according to the will of ours: for I am excluded by time, and the bond of friendship between us is greater than what can be contained by literary support. But if the cause of religion comes from a closer conference to a public contest, I ask and beseech you not to hesitate to come when called, as if to extinguish a common fire. Melanchthon will demand this in writing with great seriousness. But it may happen, as I almost predict, that the adversaries will never allow the cause of religion to be publicly debated. You will know everything from the Baslers, to whom we will also explain the smaller details. For many believe it will be the last act of this tragedy. Therefore, more careful vigilance is necessary. Please convey my greetings to Bibliander, Pellican, Erasmus, Megander, and all the best from me. Farewell. Strasbourg, 20th April in the year 1541. </p>
      <p> Wolfgang Capito. </p>
      <p> To the distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zurich, my friend and elder in the Lord, to be respected. </p>
