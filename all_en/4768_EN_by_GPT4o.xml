      <p>Hercules Salis to the esteemed overseers of the Z端rich school, greetings.</p>
      <p>Bernardino from Poschiavo, who currently exercises the evangelical ministry in a certain poor mountain village, came to me and informed me that he has brought one of his children to Z端rich with the intention that he be educated in Christian piety and good letters. However, since he is unable, due to pressing poverty, to provide the necessary expenses to support the boy as would be proper, he urged me to write to you to recommend the boy to you, to whom the task of caring for such little ones has been entrusted by your council. Indeed, knowing this man to be both honest and poor, I did not wish to fail his just requests. Therefore, I commend him to you again and again, so that, in the charity that is in you, you may assist in this matter in such a way that through you his boy may reach the best maturity, and thereafter be able to serve the church of God in some useful capacity. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, April 24, 1561.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and prudent men, the esteemed overseers of the Z端rich school, in Z端rich.</p>
