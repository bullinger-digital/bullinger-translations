    <p xml:id="regest1">Franziskus Studer will report on what was negotiated in ZÃ¼rich. Bullinger hopes that the people of St. Gallen will not stay away. He is expecting the manuscript of Vadian's "Epitome". Vadian's dangerous situation pains him. He requests Bucer's writing on church excommunication.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>You have recommended, most learned man, Franziskus Studer, the senator, and you have not said anything about the man so great that we have not admired even more in him. If only we had several like him. He himself will explain what has been negotiated, and similarly, he will say what is to be hoped for. Strive so that your people in this team do not fail us. I do not entirely despair of restoring harmony. But I anxiously await the "Epitome". If you have revised anything in it, I beg you to send it by the feast of John the Baptist, and soon also send that which you have not yet been able to prepare due to your occupations until the feast of John. But first, indicate how many gatherings you believe there will be.</p>
      <p>I am very sorry about the danger and the plots laid against you, but I urge you to be joyful and cautious. God will also put an end to these things.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>June 13, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich.</p>
      <p>I hear that Bucer has written to you about excommunication. If this is true, I beg you to share and present the writings to me, to be returned shortly.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Joachim Vadian, a lord to be especially respected by me.</p>
