      <p>My friendly, willing service along with the offering of all honors, love, and goodness beforehand. Highly learned, pious, distinguished, wise, especially gracious, dear sir. I received your letter dated the 20th of this month three days ago and have well understood its contents. I proceed to inform you in response that the writings of the late lord are still lying in a chest in Basel, well secured, and according to your request, I have considered how I might obtain the letters you requested into my hands. Thus, I have decided to speak with the secretary of the aforementioned late lord about it, who has shown himself to be friendly and willing towards me, to deliver the mentioned letters to me if they are available. And he has gone to Basel today; I have earnestly urged and sincerely requested him to thoroughly search through all the letters and writings, and although he indicated to me that he thinks there is nothing special there that might be of disadvantage to you, he has nevertheless promised me that whatever he finds, he will bring to me in Solothurn. Then it shall certainly be forwarded to you by me; for in this and greater matters, you will always find me more inclined and willing than willing to prove my love and service to you. Herewith I commend you to the highest, faithfully praying to God Almighty that He may keep you blessedly in His divine protection. Dated at Baden, the 26th of October 1552. Your willing servant Hans Wunderlich.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, pious, distinguished, wise lord Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the divine word in Zurich, my especially gracious lord.</p>
