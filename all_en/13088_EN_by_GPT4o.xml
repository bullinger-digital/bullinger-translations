    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger has not received the letter from Schürmeister, pastor of Zofingen (in the region of Aargau), his beloved brother and colleague, which was delivered by the honorable Peter Schnyder some time ago. The delay in his response is due to his many duties. However, he now replies in more detail to make up for this delay, especially since, as [Cato the Elder] would say, what is done well is done soon enough. May God grant Bullinger the grace to respond to Schürmeister in a satisfactory manner.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] His achievements are indeed more modest than Schürmeister assumes. Bullinger wishes to set aside these courtly flatteries, get to the point, and record their mutual agreements and differences.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] He fully agrees with Schürmeister's view on the Fall of Man and the rehabilitation of humanity, as it aligns with the Holy Scriptures. Like Paul, he believes that Adam sinned first, that all his descendants are born sinners and deserve death, but that God decided on their rehabilitation even before the creation of the world and humanity, before the latter could contribute anything to it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The election of humanity to salvation by God is clearly testified and explained in the Holy Scriptures. Since God is just, He will act neither contradictorily nor with bias or partiality. As a friend of humanity and the source of all mercy, He hates no one and wishes to redeem all people and lead them to the truth through His only begotten Son. God's Son enlightens every person. If one receives this light, they become a child of God. This election was decided before creation. The elect are those who are incorporated into Christ and believe in Him. Thus, a believer is an elect, and an unbeliever is an outcast, with the latter bearing the blame for their rejection along with the devil who led them astray (and not God, Christ, or the election). The Gospel remains veiled to them because they are blinded by the god of this world, namely the devil, and have preferred darkness to the light revealed to this world. Therefore, blaming God for one's condemnation is unjust! Even the prophet [Hosea] made it clear to the people of Israel that they were to blame for their own ruin and not God, who is their salvation. The Gospel also shows how Israel almost entirely rejected the invitation to the wedding and preferred earthly goods to the covenant with God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Regarding the question of justification, Schürmeister rightly refers to Paul's statement: "Just as sin spread to all through one man [Adam], [...] so does the good spread to all through one [Christ] and brings life-giving justification." And since we are incorporated into Christ (who is our righteousness) through faith, justification is attributed to faith, especially since faith attributes everything to the pure grace of the heavenly Father. It would be wrong, however, to attribute righteousness to good works, as no benevolence, not even one that springs from faith, can justify, as Paul has already clarified with the example of Abraham. Only the righteous can produce righteousness. But the righteous is the one who believes. Justifying faith, therefore, precedes the works of righteousness, which can only be considered righteous and good if they are performed by the justified.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Schürmeister and Bullinger agree on the doctrine of good works. Works are only to be considered good if they align with the will of God (and not our own discretion) and spring from the spirit of faith. An act that arises without faith and not in accordance with Scripture, but only from a person's discretion, cannot be good. However, it is also true that good deeds are rewarded, but not because the person deserves it, but only because of the generous God, especially since He works these good deeds in us.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] The philosophy is to blame for the controversial concept of free will. If only the peace-loving Christian school of thought had never adopted this concept! In line with Scripture, including James, Bullinger believes that humans always sin freely and without compulsion. It follows (which is very important) that evil is attributed not to God but to humans. Good cannot arise from the willpower of an unregenerated person. Consequently, any human good deed is only attributable to the pure grace of God. Therefore, Pelagius and [his associate] Celestius, as well as all who make God's grace superfluous, are to be condemned. However, Bullinger believes that the believer is freed from the bondage of evil and voluntarily does good according to Paul's words: "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom," or: "You have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, 'Abba! Father!'" Did Christ not say: "If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed"? God's people are therefore free, while unbelievers live in the bondage of sin. Augustine believed that there is always free will in humans, but not always good will. A person is free not to do good when serving sin, and free not to sin when serving [the righteousness granted by God]. In the latter case, a person of bad will becomes a person of good will, in whom the good will can further develop through righteousness. Up to this point, Bullinger and Schürmeister seem to be of the same opinion.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Now to the office of teaching in the church. Bullinger also thinks that without the effect of the Holy Spirit, this inner teacher, a servant of God can achieve nothing with his teaching! It is not humans, but God's Spirit that brings others to faith, just as He once brought Peter to it. However, even though Bullinger attributes the effectiveness of preaching solely to the inner teacher, he does not think that the spiritual office of a teacher or instructor is insignificant or superfluous. According to Paul, faith comes from hearing. And it was Peter, summoned by Cornelius, who offered the Gentiles the Gospel to hear. The Lord also said: "He who hears you hears me." However, it is important to remain humble, not to attribute too much to one's own activity, and not to misuse biblical texts like the papists to present oneself as earthly gods! Paul already emphasized that we are only servants of Christ who convey God's mysteries of faith. That is enough! Bullinger cannot agree with those who proclaim from [the pulpit]: "Here stands Christ before you!" or "Here speaks Christ to you!" for all honor belongs to Christ and His Word alone. We must remain aware that we are proclaiming not our words, but Christ's words. It is true that Paul occasionally gives the impression that he himself opened the hearts and eyes of his listeners and renewed them. But only the godless do not realize that these are figures of speech (tropes). The pious, however, attribute any success to God's Word and not to the word of His servants. Augustine also believes that people are taught by God and not by humans. Humans merely proclaim the word with their external voice, but only the Creator can reveal it to them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Augustine also distinguishes, in line with John, between official and effective baptism. The latter can only be granted by Christ, Christ, over whom John the Baptist saw the dove descend from heaven. The ability to baptize with the Spirit was not transmitted by Christ to His servants, otherwise, there would be as many baptisms as there are servants. Paul also emphasizes this by stressing that he was not crucified for the people he baptized and that he did not baptize them in his name. Therefore, Bullinger cannot approve of anyone who proclaims: "I renew you!"; "I baptize you and thereby grant you the Holy Spirit!"; "I forgive you your sins!"; "For your salvation, I feed you with the Lord Himself!" Bullinger knows that it is written: "Whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven." But this is only a figure of speech that, like many other biblical figures of speech, must be correctly understood if we do not want to become blasphemers who rob Christ of His due honor. Augustine already called those who said: "We baptize" deceivers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Bullinger believes that it is the task of church officials to present the mysteries of faith to people as clearly as possible. The Lord did not command in vain to proclaim what was whispered in their ears on the rooftops. Paul also emphasized the important role of interpretation in the congregation so that the listener would not be misled but enlightened. After all, language is there to enable mutual understanding. The church servant should therefore not use any new misleading phrases, especially not in controversial questions! If one wants to help disputing parties with phrases that everyone can interpret in their own way, one only fuels the dispute even more and betrays one's own inconsistency! One must take a stand. Did Paul not rebuke Peter when he showed himself to be wavering?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] When Schürmeister came to Zofingen, he found a church already divided. But he also knew according to which old doctrine the church there was reformed. He also knew that the records of the Bern Disputation [of 1528] set out this doctrine in detail. Therefore, it was not appropriate to try to appease the dispute with vague and ambiguous statements. It would have been much better to clearly present the truth, take a stand for the advocates of the disputation, and fight the opposing party. Bullinger hopes that Schürmeister will do this in the future, especially since he wrote in his letter: "I resorted to unusual figures of speech that I acquired during my long stay abroad while reading the Church Fathers (who often express themselves in an non-binding manner about the Lord's Supper). However, I now want to improve in this regard." Schürmeister should indeed do this! He will soon notice the good consequences it has. He should no longer listen to those who attribute any effectiveness to the Lord's Supper. How can such claims be useful to Bullinger if he does not know what effectiveness is being referred to? Knowledge is gained through explanations. And the knowledge thus conveyed gives authority to a matter. Augustine advises against unclear explanations. One may imitate those statements of the apostles and prophets that are understandable, but not those that express useful and salvific truths in a veiled manner, because their authors tried to sharpen the intelligence of their readers in this way, not to bore them, to encourage them to study, or also because they wanted to make these truths difficult for the godless to access, either to withhold the mysteries of God from them or to arouse their interest in piety. However, the interpreters of these difficult passages should not try to present themselves as authorities in their interpretive work. They should rather serve clarity so that either the limited understanding of the listener or the difficulty of the subject matter is to blame if one can no longer follow. From these explanations of Augustine, Schürmeister can gather what would be of great benefit to the church. May the Lord grant him the will and strength to do so!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] And indeed, Schürmeister could have expressed himself much more clearly and simply about the Lord's Supper if he had followed this instruction! However, Bullinger does not reject everything he has written on this subject. But he would have wished for greater acumen and more clarity in his line of thought. Schürmeister should know that the Lord's Supper is not just any, but a divine act to be performed in the church and instituted by God Himself. The Lord urged His disciples to do what He had done, namely to call people to Him, proclaim the Gospel to them, bless them, invoke God and give thanks, offer bread and wine, break the bread, distribute bread and wine, and call on people to eat and drink. When this is done in the church, the holy act of the Lord's Supper arises. And if one wanted to know why the Lord's Supper should be held, the answer comes from the Lord Himself: "Do this in remembrance of me!" It is therefore important to remember the benefits performed by Christ in the past and present. That is why the Lord spoke of the bread as His body sacrificed for us and of the wine as His shed blood. Since the sacrament consists of these symbols and memorials, our thoughts are directed to heaven during the celebration of the Lord's Supper, where Christ sits at the right hand of God. The bread and wine, just like circumcision in the past, become a sacrament, a sign, bearing witness to the truth of Christ's redeeming death. And so the Lord's Supper (just like circumcision in the past) becomes a visible seal of faith, the faith in God who justifies the person who believes in Him. The use of a seal among people corresponds approximately to the use of the Lord's Supper among believers. Among the godless, neither words nor deeds, neither writings nor laws, nor any seal apply, quite differently than among believers, who are greatly strengthened by the Holy Spirit in the Lord's Supper. The Lord's Supper therefore requires faith from the participants. According to Paul, one must examine oneself regarding one's faith. The object of faith is God and the mystery of redemption through Christ. Whoever believes is righteous and lives in communion with God: this one in him and he in this one! No wonder Christ says: "Whoever eats my flesh and drinks my blood remains in me, and I in him," while John writes: "Whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God remains in him, and he remains in God." The Lord's Supper therefore requires a believing participant. If he does not believe, he participates in the Lord's Supper in an unworthy manner. But if he believes, he will certainly not first attain communion with Christ in the Lord's Supper. Does he perhaps receive nothing in the Lord's Supper? Certainly, he receives something! In the Lord's Supper, the faith that binds him to Christ is renewed and strengthened. He also becomes aware that all participants are members of the one Lord. In the Lord's Supper, this communion is also renewed and testified. This is a clear and conforming interpretation of the Lord's Supper with Christian doctrine. Only faith, not the law, not works, not ceremonies or sacraments, can justify the Christian! Schürmeister will have understood in the meantime that being justified, acquitted of sin, and richly fed or quenched is one and the same.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] This is to be proclaimed in detail, while opposing opinions that do not correspond to the truth are to be fought and expelled from the church. Among the errors is also the claim that sins are forgiven through participation in the Lord's Supper. Sins are forgiven by believing, and indeed before our participation in the Lord's Supper, just as Abraham was justified before he was circumcised! However, the Lord's Supper testifies that our sins have been forgiven.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] This is not the place to refute the absurd belief in a physical feeding on the body of Christ in the Lord's Supper at length, especially since Schürmeister undoubtedly shares Bullinger's view. Christ already emphasized that it is of no use to eat His flesh physically. One must receive Him spiritually! Moreover, Christ left the earth and now sits at the right hand of God, from where He will return to judge the living and the dead. After the resurrection, He retained a body similar to ours, which is neither invisible nor intangible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] Bullinger has extracted and commented on the main points of faith from Schürmeister's letter. In doing so, he has addressed the question of how much he and Schürmeister agree, as well as the question of what every pious person should believe in accordance with God and His Word. Schürmeister should also share this letter with Heinrich Summerer, pastor in Burgdorf, and his assistant Johann Knechtenhofer, as well as Peter Schnyder, pastor in Aarburg, as this will strengthen the friendship and unity among them. Bullinger hopes that Schürmeister is now on good terms with Schnyder again. We must be sons of peace and teach only what serves edification in the church! Quarrels and disputes over subtle questions must be stopped!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] If Schürmeister finds anything in this letter that does not correspond to the truth, is unclear, incomprehensible, inappropriate, too verbose, or too brief, he should please report it so that Bullinger can clarify the corresponding passage.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] Greetings, also to all the pious and truth lovers. May we sincerely love one another!</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>To the faithful minister of Christ Jesus, Mr. Benedikt Schürmeister, pastor of the church in Zofingen in the region of Aargau, his most beloved brother and colleague, greetings. The honorable Peter Schnyder delivered your letters to me, dear brother, whom I hold in high esteem, but I am responding somewhat late due to my many duties. However, I am replying more extensively to make up for what was lacking in the previous response. Indeed, as the saying goes, "Soon enough if well enough." May the Almighty grant that I respond to you well. For without Him, all our efforts are not only incomplete and mutilated but also nothing!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Our achievements are indeed modest. You seem to praise and extol them too much. But I attribute this to your kindness. Let us set aside these excessive courtly congratulations and thanks! We will now descend to more important matters, to inquire how much we agree or disagree on the doctrines of the Christian religion.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We agree very well on those things you gather from the fall and restoration of man from the beginning, because you have everything according to the meaning of Scripture. Paul in the Epistle to the Romans: From Adam derives evil and sin. The same in the Epistle to the Ephesians asserts: All the children of Adam are born children of wrath, and therefore subject to death and condemnation. The same famous doctor of the Gentiles attributes our restoration to the mere grace of God: God chose us before the foundation of the world to eternal life, namely when no human being had yet been created to commend themselves to God by their merits.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Moreover, the manner of God's election, by which He saves the elect, is certainly and simply set forth in the holy scriptures. God is just. God is truthful and holy, doing all things in judgment and justice. He neither disagrees nor fights with Himself. He neither respects persons nor is entangled or disturbed by affections. He cannot hate His creature, who is called by the divine apostle ὁ ϕιλάνθρωπος (the friend of humanity), and by all scripture "the father of mercies and compassion." Therefore, He wills by His immense goodness that all men be saved and come to the knowledge of the truth, and that through faith in His only begotten Son. For these divine and well-known oracles of scripture are well known: In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed; "And that true light was, which enlightens every man coming into the world"; likewise: "As many as received Him, He gave them the right to become children of God," etc. Therefore, Paul significantly said: God chose us before the foundation of the world, and indeed chose us in Christ. Therefore, the elect are those who are in Christ. In Christ are believers; therefore, believers are elect. Unbelievers are reprobate, the fault of rejection clinging to us and to Satan the suggester, not in Christ, not in God, not in election! For Paul: If our gospel, he says, is veiled, it is veiled to those who are perishing, in whom the god of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers, etc. What, that the Lord Himself said in the gospel: "And this is the condemnation, that light has come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light," etc.? Therefore, they are unjust who cry out that God is the author of their condemnation, against whom the prophet cried out: Your destruction, O Israel, is because your help is in me. All Israelites are invited to the wedding in the gospel, but that few or none come is because they value more the farm, fields, oxen, wives, and other worldly things than the covenant of God and heavenly things.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Discussing justification, you bring forth that statement of Paul: "Just as through one man's offense evil spread to all men to condemnation, so through one man's righteousness good spreads to all men to justification of life." And you bring it forth very rightly! For speaking most properly, Christ justifies us. Christ is our righteousness. However, because faith inserts us into Christ and makes us partakers of Christ, justification is also attributed to faith, especially since faith refers all things to the divine and pure grace of the heavenly Father. Righteousness is also improperly attributed to works. Indeed, no works justify a man, not even those that are of faith, as the apostle demonstrates with the example of faithful Abraham, whose faith was counted to him as righteousness. Finally, the righteous man works righteousness, and unless one is righteous, he does not do righteousness. And the righteous lives by his faith. Therefore, justifying faith precedes; the works of righteousness follow, which are done by the righteous, and cannot be called righteous or good unless they had been done by the righteous.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>In the doctrine of good works, we do not disagree. For good works are those that are done according to the prescription of God (not from our own choice), finally those that are done from the spirit of faith. Works that are done without faith, outside the word of God, from human choice, are not good works. And indeed, good works have a reward, not because of the merit of man, but from the liberality of God who promises. He Himself works in us His gifts and good things. "For what do you have that you did not receive?" says the apostle.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The term free will we owe to contentious philosophy. I would prefer it had never been received into the peaceful school of Christ. I feel and judge according to the scriptures that man sins of his own accord, and therefore freely and not by compulsion. For thus the apostle James taught me to feel in chapter 1. The whole prophetic and apostolic scripture agrees and supports James the apostle. Hence, above all, evil is not to be imputed to God, but derived from ourselves. But I know that good and good works are not to be attributed to the strength or will of man not yet regenerated, and therefore evil and corrupt. For all good things in man are mere gifts of divine grace. For I condemn Pelagius, Celestius, and all who nullify the grace of God. Again, I do not involve believers in servitude, taking away from them freedom or free will in doing good. For Paul: "Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom." But the same elsewhere: "You have not received a spirit of slavery leading to fear again, but a spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, 'Abba, Father.'" Hence, the Lord Himself cries out in the gospel: "If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed." But He has set us free, therefore we are free. Hence, the whole scripture calls the people of God spontaneous, nowhere compelled. But unbelievers are slaves, and indeed slaves of sin. Saint Augustine also, judging according to scripture, in De gratia et libero arbitrio, chapter 15, to Valentinus: "There is always, he says, free will in us, but it is not always good. For it is free from righteousness when it serves sin, and then it is bad, or it is free from sin when it serves righteousness, and then it is good. And through this (righteousness) it happens that a man becomes of good will, who was previously of bad will. Through this also it happens that the good will itself, which has already begun to be, is increased," and what follows. Up to this point, therefore, I think we do not disagree badly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Regarding the office of teaching in the church of Christ, I also believe that without the internal teacher, the Holy Spirit, a minister achieves nothing with his teaching. "For no one comes to me, says the Lord, unless my Father draws him." But flesh and blood do not reveal faith either to Peter or to any mortal, but the Father who is in heaven. And although I attribute all glory and effect of preaching to the Holy Spirit, the internal teacher, I do not, however, take away or consider useless the ecclesiastical ministry or the office of teaching or instructing in the church through ministers. I acknowledge that of Paul: "Faith comes from hearing, and hearing through the word of God" and "How will they believe in Him whom they have not heard?" etc. Romans 10. I know that Peter, called to Cornelius, instructed the Gentiles by the preaching of the gospel, and they were not instructed without the evangelical voice or hidden guidance. I also acknowledge that when the minister announces the word of Christ, it is to be believed as if the Lord Himself were teaching: "He who hears you hears me." And Paul testifying: "When you received the word from us, by which you learned of God, you received it not as the word of men, but as it truly is, the word of God, which also works in you who believe." However, I require here humility, prudence, and modesty from ministers, lest they do anything excessively, and lest they seem to preach themselves more than the Lord and His word. For the papal priests, aided by such places, or rather subverted, sold themselves as earthly gods! Therefore, let us not, by the help of the Lord's word, restore and revive what we have once destroyed! "Let a man consider us, says Paul, as ministers of Christ and stewards of the mysteries of God." This was enough for Paul. That seemed a sufficiently great authority for a minister. Therefore, they are excessive, to say nothing else, who cry out: "Here, here stands Christ!" "Here, here speaks Christ to you, not John, not Philip, not Charles!" Rather, let us refer all glory to Christ and His word, saying: "We are ministers of Christ, we bring forth the word of Christ, to which, if you believe, you believe not our word (who are men and ministers), but the word of Christ!" For true piety commands us to discern most diligently between God's operation and our ministry. I confess that elsewhere the apostle says that he regenerates through the gospel, that he opens hearts, eyes, etc. But who, unless impious, does not know that these are expressions to be piously explained, just as when the apostles are called saviors and the light of the world? The pious understand that this is attributed to them because of the word of God, and therefore refer all glory to the word, not to men! Hence, Saint Augustine sincerely in his treatise on John 26: "All the people of that kingdom, he says, 'are teachable by God.' They will not hear from men (even if they hear from men), yet what they understand is given inwardly, shines inwardly, and is revealed inwardly. What do men do announcing outwardly? What do I do now when I speak? I pour the noise of words into your ears, unless He who is within reveals, what do I say and what do I speak? The external cultivator of the tree, the internal is the creator. He who plants and he who waters works externally. This we do, but neither he who plants is anything, nor he who waters, but God who gives the increase. This is: 'They will all be teachable by God.'</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>And in his treatise on John 5: "It is one thing, he says, to baptize through ministry, another to baptize through power." "Our Lord Jesus Christ could have, if He had willed, given power to any of His servants to give His baptism as if in His place, and transferred the power of baptizing from Himself, and established it in any of His servants, and given as much power to the baptism transferred to a servant as the baptism given by the Lord has. He did not want this, so that the hope of the baptized would be in Him, from whom they would acknowledge themselves to be baptized. Therefore, He did not want a servant to place hope in a servant. And so the apostle cried out when he saw men wanting to place hope in himself: 'Was Paul crucified for you, or were you baptized in the name of Paul?' Therefore, Paul baptized as a minister, not as the power itself. Pay attention! And He could have given this power to servants, but He did not want to. For if He gave this power to servants, that is, that what was the Lord's was also theirs, there would be as many baptisms as there are servants!" etc. And again in the same treatise: "What then did John learn, he says, through the dove? He said to me, 'Upon whom you see the Spirit descending like a dove and remaining upon Him, this is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' Therefore, do not be deceived, O dove, by seducers who say: 'We baptize.' Dove, recognize what the dove taught: 'This is He who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.' Through the dove it is learned, because this is He. And do you think you are baptized by the power of Him whose ministry you are baptized by? If you think this, you are not in the body of the dove, it is not surprising, because you do not have simplicity. For simplicity is especially demonstrated through the dove. Through the simplicity of the dove, John learned. Because this is Christ, who baptizes with the Holy Spirit," etc. We have recited the words of Augustine thus far, and indeed they are taken not from the brain of Augustine, but from the marrow of the words of God. Since these things are so, I cannot approve of the manner of teaching in the church of those who, having delivered a written and spoken word to the people, cry out: "I regenerate you! I baptize you, and by baptizing I confer the Holy Spirit! I forgive you your sins! I present to you the Lord Jesus Himself to be eaten for eternal life!" I know indeed that it is written, "Whose sins you forgive, they are forgiven," etc. I know that many expressions of this kind occur in the sacred writings to the reader. But I know in turn (as I also said just now) that a pious interpretation must be applied, lest we seem to rob Christ of His glory with an inexpiable sacrilege! Saint Augustine called those who say: "We baptize" deceivers without a figure. The same: "Christ could have given power to any of His servants, he says, to baptize in His place, and He did not give it." Hence, the ancients, whenever they spoke of the ministry of the sacraments, spoke significantly, saying: "Christ gives Himself as food to the faithful"; "Faithful ministers administer the sacraments of Christ." Because today these things are mixed and not significantly distinguished, what Christ does, what the minister does (because expressions are offered without interpretation, indeed deliberately without pious and convenient interpretation), therefore the opinion of the hearers varies, and it is miserably contended with great detriment to the churches.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I see, my dearest Benedikt, that the ministry in the Church is instituted so that all the mysteries of Christ are explained as significantly, clearly, and simply as possible. For the best teacher in the church is the one who is the clearest, most apt, and simplest of all. For it is not in vain that the Lord said: "What you have heard in the ear, preach on the rooftops!" But the apostle also demonstrates in 1 Corinthians, chapter 14, that prophecy, that is, the clear interpretation of the scriptures, which explains the listener, not entangles him, which instructs and promotes him, is by far the most excellent in the church. Now common sense also dictates that speech was invented so that we might understand each other mutually. Therefore, every minister of the church should not introduce new forms of speaking into the church, which entangle it, but rather accommodate himself to the church with clarity, so that he may explain the entangled and speak as significantly as possible, especially when contention has arisen in the cause being discussed! For then to want to use expressions that seem to help both sides, what is this, I pray, but to confirm the contention, and to sit on two stools. A good and ecclesiastical man cannot be neutral. He must join one side altogether. The apostle Paul once rebuked the apostle Peter very sharply and in the sight of the church, because he did not seem to walk with a straight foot, indeed he limped somewhat. But the apostle teaches in that place that a good man must altogether join the side that holds the truth, and then help it both with words and deeds, add also with his whole conversation.</p>

    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>You came to Zofingen. You found the church torn and scattered because of the matter of the supper. Meanwhile, you are not unaware of what the old doctrine is, to which that church was reformed. The Acts of the Bern Disputation copiously set forth the kind of doctrine. Therefore, it was not appropriate to propose ambiguous, double-edged, figurative expressions to the disputants, but having omitted or certainly interpreted them, to propose the plain truth in the simplest dispute, and to help that side which teaches the opinion of the Disputation, confirmed by scripture, and to oppose the adverse side and, as much as is given, to remove it again from the church by the word of truth. And I hope you will do this altogether, since in those letters of yours given to me among other things: "I used, you say, idioms of speech not accustomed to all, which I contracted from the fact that I was for some time outside the country and engaged in the reading of the fathers, who are accustomed to speak more freely about the synaxis, but in the future I will easily correct this." Therefore, do, my Benedikt, what you see must be done altogether, and you will feel no small fruit arise in the church! You will not listen to those who pretend that some authority is conferred on the sacraments through expressions! For how could that be of great value to me, which, what or what kind it is, I do not know? Things come into knowledge through interpretation. Authority is proved by knowledge, and from institution. Moreover, in this matter, you do not only hear me consulting, but also Saint Augustine. For he in book 4 of De doctrina christiana, chapter 8: "But we, he says, even if we take some examples of expression from the letters of the apostles and prophets, which are understood without difficulty, we must by no means think that we should imitate them in those things which they said with useful and salutary obscurity to exercise and polish, as it were, the minds of the readers, and to break the fastidiousness and sharpen the studies of those who want to learn, and also to hide (whether to convert them to piety, or to exclude them from the mysteries) the minds of the impious. For they spoke in such a way that later those who rightly understood and explained them would find another grace, indeed different, but nevertheless subsequent in the church of God. Therefore, the expositors of them should not speak in such a way as to propose themselves to be explained with similar authority, but in all their speeches they should first and foremost strive to be understood, and, as much as they can, with clarity of speech, so that either he is very slow who does not understand, or in the difficulty and subtlety of the things we want to explain and show, not in our speech, is the cause why it cannot be understood or is understood more slowly." So much Augustine. From these, your piety understands what would be done with much utility for the church. May the Lord grant you the faculties of mind and the power to accomplish those things that are useful.</p>

      <p>And you could have discussed the Lord's Supper much more clearly and simply if you had observed this rule; not that I reject your things altogether, but that I require more clarity and a more fitting order in discussing. The Lord's Supper itself, my Benedikt, if you truly inquire about its kind, is an action, and indeed not just any action, but a divine one, divinely instituted in the church. For the Lord says to the disciples: "Do this!" What do this? What you see me doing: I have called you; I preach the gospel; I bless; I pray; I give thanks; meanwhile, I offer you bread and wine, distribute, break, command to eat and drink, etc. This, I say, do! While I do these things, which the Lord commanded and did first (they are done in the church), the sacred action is exercised. But for what purpose, I pray, did the best Lord command these things to be done? He Himself answered and said: "In remembrance of me." Therefore, by the action, He wants the Lord to be remembered and the memory of His benefits to be as if recent; of Himself, I say, and of His benefits, that He gave His body to death for us and shed His blood for our cleansing. Therefore, the bread is called "the body given," the wine "the blood shed." For they are symbols and memorials or sacraments of the given body and shed blood, so that when they are proposed to us in the church, they almost lift our minds up to heaven, where we believe Christ the Lord sits with His true body and blood. Bread and wine are also sacraments, signs, testimonies of the truth; of that truth, I say, that the Lord gave Himself for us, so that now the Lord's Supper may be called the sealing of faith, just as the apostle called circumcision the sealing of faith, of that faith, I say, by which he believed that God justifies believers freely. For the Lord confirmed by the Supper, as by a visible seal, that He gave Himself to death for believers, so that they might live. Therefore, the same use of seals among men is partly the use of the Supper among the faithful. Among the unbelievers, neither words, nor deeds, nor letters or tablets, nor seals are valid. And indeed, the minds of the faithful are sealed and confirmed most by the Holy Spirit, but in their own way, and by the sacraments as instituted by God, all of which have their authority from the Spirit of God. Because the Supper is a kind of sealing of faith and a memory of the Lord's death, it primarily requires faith from those who sit or dine. Therefore, the apostle: "Let a man examine himself, he says, and then let him eat of this bread and drink of the cup." But that examination of the faithful is rightly done by the examination of faith. But faith is one; and it has one object: God and the mystery of redemption through Christ. Whoever has this faith is righteous, is holy, has communion with God. God abides in him and he in God, indeed Christ already lives in him, Paul testifying: "I live, yet not I, but Christ lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God, who loved me and gave Himself for me," etc. But the Lord Himself also says in the gospel: "He who eats my flesh and drinks my blood abides in me and I in him." Again, the apostle and evangelist explaining that kind of expression: "Whoever confesses, he says, that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him and he in God." What is it to confess the Son of God, but to believe in the Son of God? Therefore, whoever believes in the Son of God has communion with Christ, and indeed such communion that Christ lives wholly in the believer and the believer in Christ. Now, since the Lord's Supper requires a believing participant, as I have just shown, it certainly requires him who has communion with Christ. But if he has communion with Christ, when he sits or comes to the Supper, he certainly does not first receive communion with Christ in the Supper. For unless he has communion with Christ, he is not a believer. If he is an unbeliever, he eats unworthily of this bread and drinks of the cup, nor indeed does he eat the flesh of the Lord or drink His blood. What then shall we say here? Does the believer sitting at the Supper receive nothing in the mystery of the Supper? He receives something! For he receives the bread and cup of the Lord and by receiving continues, renews, and exercises the faith by which he is joined to Christ. To all the diners, he thus openly testifies that they are members of Christ and of the church of Christ. In this way, the apostle called the bread and wine of the Lord the communion of the body and blood of Christ, 1 Corinthians 10, because, namely, the communion we have with Christ, in spirit through faith, we continue, renew, and testify in the Supper of bread and wine. This is the simple meaning of the Lord's Supper, agreeing with the universal Christian doctrine: By faith alone, not by law, not by works, not by ceremonies, not by any sacraments, are Christians justified! You undoubtedly understand that to be justified, to be absolved, to be fed and drunk to satisfaction, all come to the same thing.</p>

      <p>These things, therefore, must be taught clearly, and on the contrary, opinions contrary to this truth or certainly not agreeing in all respects must be refuted and eradicated from the church; of which kind are: That by the communion of the Supper, that is, by this work of the Supper, sins are forgiven and remitted to us. For sins are forgiven by faith! And they are forgiven if we believe, even before we come to the Supper. In the Supper, we receive the sealing and testimony of the remission of sins, just as Abraham was justified before he was circumcised. Yet he received circumcision, the sign of the righteousness of faith, Romans 4.</p>

    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>It is a plainly absurd doctrine, which some urge by all means, that the corporal eating of the body of Christ, which they call real and substantial, is given for eternal life! Against which opinion the Lord Himself, disputing, said that the flesh eaten corporally does not profit. Moreover, it is certain that spiritual eating (which is of faith, and not otherwise) is conducive and instituted for life, which (life) the sacramental action exercises and renews or continues. Therefore, what the Lord said: "Eat, this is my body," speaking of the mystery, He said. For He instituted the sacrament sacramentally, therefore the expression is to be explained not corporally, as if He had delivered the very essence of His body to be eaten corporally. But other scripture passages do not allow us to believe in the corporal presence in the Lord's Supper. For our Lord has gone away. He sits at the right hand of the Father, from there to judge the living and the dead at the end of the world. Now also our Lord has a true and consubstantial body, which cannot be in many places at once. The same body is neither invisible nor impalpable. For He offered His body both to be seen and touched after the resurrection: Luke 24; John 20. Therefore, they achieve nothing who invent an invisible mode. But about these things, there is no need to dispute with you, who undoubtedly feel with us.</p>

      <p>I have thus far set forth my judgment on that letter of yours, in which you, as it were, render an account of your faith by recounting the principal chapters, and to what extent I agree with you, indeed to what extent both of us and all the pious ought to agree with God and the word of truth. You will share these things, if it seems so, with both the brothers Mr. Heinrich Summerer, pastor of the church in Burgdorf, and Mr. Johann Knechtenhofer, his deacon, furthermore with Mr. Peter Schnyder, pastor in Aarburg, with whom, although I do not doubt you agree. However, friendship and concord will be confirmed through the communication of letters. Let us be, I beseech you, all sons of peace, and teach those things in the church that edify! Let all enmities cease! Let curious disputes perish!</p>
