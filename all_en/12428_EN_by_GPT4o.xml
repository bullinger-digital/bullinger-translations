    <p xml:id="regest1">On March 8, letters from Emperor [Charles V.] were delivered to the participants of the [Religious Discussion] in Regensburg. Blarer does not yet know their content, as the [Constance?] messenger left Regensburg before the letters were read.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Reports from Bonn describe how cruelly the Imperial forces are proceeding against the Protestants. In Antwerp, a pious man [Jacob Liesvelt?] was burned because of the Gospel. [Charles V.] issued a new, even more cruel mandate against the Protestants in Gelderland and Flanders. Peter Scher the Elder [of Schwarzenburg] brought a copy of it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Despite the Protestant delegation, [Charles V.] has demanded the [Arch]bishop of Cologne, [Hermann of Wied], under threat of [imperial ban], to expel all evangelical preachers from the land within 14 days and to restore Catholicism. This reveals the true disposition of the Emperor, who will likely first attack Cologne. A bloody summer is to be expected.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- In Trier, an old man [...] is preaching the Gospel. The Papists wanted to expel him, but the citizens are supporting him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Blarer will write again soon [No. 2385]. Enclosed, he sends back Bullinger's writing [„De sacramentis“], which he has only partially read and will read completely once it is published.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- He asks Bullinger to forward his letter to Theodor [Bibliander].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- [P.S.:] The enclosed documents, which he himself could not yet read because they were delivered late at night, should be returned to Bullinger soon.</p>

      <p>On March 8, imperial letters arrived in Regensburg for the participants of the colloquy. However, we do not yet know what is in them, as the messenger from Regensburg hurried away before the letters were read.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>From Bonn, it is reported how the imperial forces are still raging so cruelly against the Protestants. Recently, a truly righteous and pious man was burned in Antwerp for the sake of the Gospel. The Emperor has issued a new mandate against the Protestants, more cruel than before, which has been proclaimed in Gelderland and Flanders; a copy of this mandate has been brought here by the elder Peter Schär.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Despite the Protestant delegation, the Emperor has commanded the Bishop of Cologne to expel all evangelical preachers from the land within 14 days, to return to the Roman Church, and to restore everything to its former state; otherwise, proceedings will be taken against him with censures. This clearly shows what the Emperor has in mind, and that he will ignite the misfortune with Cologne. This is most convenient: he has his land back and in hand. Thus, it is to be feared that we will have a very bloody summer.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>In Trier, a very good, old, dear man is preaching the Gospel. The Papists have tried everything to remove him (expel him); but the citizens are supporting him.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I was not allowed to add a single word. I will write again soon and now send your book, which I have almost read without offense, although I hesitated somewhere, but continued with eagerness to read everything more diligently, once it is published.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Again and again, farewell. I wrote another letter three days ago to Theodor, which you will ensure is delivered to him. Farewell, my dearest and best Bullinger, and commend us most diligently to the Lord. March 15, 1546.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Return these documents, as well as the previous ones. I would be lost if I had read everything. They were delivered late at night yesterday.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
