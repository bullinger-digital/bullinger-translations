      <p>Grace and peace from God, the Father, through His Christ Jesus, our Lord, first and foremost.</p>
      <p>Honorable, well-learned, especially dear lords and brothers, regarding your letter concerning our beloved brother Leo Jud, we have understood its content, and although it was brought to him that the mentioned Leo is refused to be sent to us, we have not let ourselves be deterred, sparing neither effort nor work nor cost, and have once again humbly requested the high-born prince, our gracious lord, Count Georg of Württemberg, etc., to write to the honorable council of Zurich, with the request that Master Erasmus Schmid be recognized to preach for four or five years. Therefore, we now send for the third time to you our beloved brother Nikolaus König, with letters from our gracious lord, etc., to the honorable council, to bring Leo and Erasmus and to exhort you as before, since Leo is refused to us, that you, to the praise and glory of the divine name, promote the matter in such a way with the honorable council, also with you and your brothers, so that our beloved brother Erasmus Schmid may be recognized to preach for four or five years; in this, you will undoubtedly promote the honor of God and increase His praise and glory, which we are always brotherly and faithfully willing to earn from you.</p>
      <p>Given in Riquewihr, Monday, the fourth day of October in the year 1535.</p>
