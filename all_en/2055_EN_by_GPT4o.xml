      <p>Greetings. I have absolutely nothing that Master Zwingli cannot convey to you orally. I am sending back to you the letters of the Bishop of Bayonne, a cunning and crafty man, and I thank you for sharing them. I am waiting to hear what you have decided regarding the case of Servetus. I pray that you communicate this to us promptly. Farewell, along with all your household, both family and brothers, and collaborators in the work of the Lord. Musculus and our people send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Bern, 28th October 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most venerable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
