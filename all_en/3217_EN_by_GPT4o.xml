      <p>Greetings. I am pleased to hear that my letters, even when lengthy and burdensome, are not unwelcome to you, esteemed lord and dearest brother. This is a testament to your singular love for me.</p>
      <p>Continue to love me in this way: certainly, you are dear to me in return. If I have done anything in the cause of the Waldensian brothers, I owed it. It is also a divine gift whatever good proceeds from us. What remains is that we diligently continue to pray that the king's mind may be turned and his heart made soft. The pope has brought the king into the greatest danger, so that he no longer enjoys success and happy fortune. I wish those shameless rascals would not persuade him that he will not enjoy better fortune unless the new heresy is eradicated along with the most wicked heretics. But God lives, who sees all these things and governs all with His holy providence. It is our duty to pray for the king's safety.</p>
      <p>I beg you not to take it badly that I have changed my plan about coming to you. God, the searcher of hearts, knows that I nonetheless love you and the church and republic of Geneva from the heart and wish you all the best. There are, however, many reasons why I could not come now.</p>
      <p>I do not see what plan can now be devised, what can be done with the Saxons. Here the saying of the Comic comes to mind: a matter which in itself has neither counsel nor measure cannot be governed by counsel... is it? For what can you do? These men do not listen to any reasons, they have hardened their minds, and have set this as the principle of their affairs, that the Enthusiasts (Schwärmer) are neither to be heard nor tolerated. Most of them hold this opinion. If any more moderate ones remain, they are swept away with them, for they either do not dare to mutter a word, or they do not want to throw themselves into open danger. For those who have spoken a word for us seem to be regarded as public enemies. If you come to a conference with such men a hundred times, and do not simply approve all their things, you will be condemned as a heretic. I do not shrink from or abhor fair and moderate conferences: meanwhile, I know that we will achieve nothing with conferences with such men. The Marburg Colloquy, the Eisenach, or the Wittenberg Colloquy have long taught me what to hope for. Their daily writings, both private and public, teach. Their madness has erupted to such an extent that they seem irreconcilable, and no remedy remains but the hand of the Lord. There is at least some hope in the moderation of the princes, although they will not even respect these. Therefore, if you have decided to respond to the Magdeburg writing, proceed, do not delay. They have anticipated you. No one will take offense at a moderate response. The princes will not take it badly, nor will it disturb a legitimate conference. But if nothing is answered by us, they will boast that they have a just cause, that our arguments have been so clearly and evidently refuted that nothing remains for us to oppose. Many will therefore be confirmed in error, and even the weaker will turn aside into error. I would, however, wish that you would regard only the cause, passing over their persons, and first refute their arguments, which they bring for their bodily presence, then defend our arguments and show that their responses are sophistical, our arguments remain firm. But why do I prescribe this to you, who yourself see far better what is fitting and useful? Therefore, I leave these things to your piety and prudence. May the Lord instruct you with His holy spirit, that what you undertake may lead to the glory of God and the edification of the church.</p>
      <p>I have responded briefly to the booklet of Jakob Andreae, and I have taken care to have two copies made for me, one I send to the most illustrious prince Landgrave, the other to Count Georg of Württemberg, from whom I first received it. I profess before them that there will be no delay on our part if a place is given for a moderate conference, nor do we shrink from reconciliation if any can be found that does not differ from the scriptures. But if our brothers insist that we simply embrace their opinion (which they have done so far), we cannot abandon the clear truth to accept what is alien to the truth.</p>
      <p>The envoys of our republic, now at the Baden Diet, will soon from the beginning remind the envoys of Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen of what the Prince of Württemberg said to Farel and Beza as they were departing. Therefore, it seems to him not only useful but necessary that letters be written promptly, while the princes are still in Frankfurt, to inform them of the good will of the Swiss churches towards the princes and their churches. But what the other cities will do, I cannot easily say. Let us pray to the Lord that He may implant in their minds what He knows pertains to His glory and the edification of the church.</p>
      <p>Jakob Andreae is one of the more moderate ones, and as far as I understand from your letters, known and familiar to you. But if only you could understand his German booklet, you would see with what confidence he teaches Lutheranism. That which you might wonder at, he especially insists that even the impious partake of the true body of Christ. He says it is a mere human figment if anyone imagines heaven to be a certain place. He says most manifestly that the Son of Man is everywhere and fills all things. If this is done by a calm and moderate man, what do you expect or hope from others? Nor do all these ask for any meetings or conferences to be given to them, but they simply impress upon the princes and people that this is the undoubted truth which Luther taught, this is to be defended, the contrary to be eradicated, neither conference nor our books to be given place. These things are certain.</p>
      <p>No one has ever accused you more severely than Alberus. He has dealt not only with the cause of the supper but also of baptism and of infants dying without baptism. But if you diligently (which I do not doubt you will do) respond to the argument of the Magdeburgers, Erasmus Alberus will be refuted in the cause of the Eucharist.</p>
      <p>Concerning the vision of Paul, I agree with you, and I have already written the same to the Landgrave. These things I have briefly responded to your letters.</p>
      <p>Love me and all the fellow ministers equally, who bid you farewell. Farewell excellently.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 20th of June, 1557.</p>
      <p>May the brothers and all the fellow ministers be safe.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Monsieur de Jonvilliers, I could not write to him now due to the brevity of time and my affairs. May he be safe.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Monsieur Jean Calvin, most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
