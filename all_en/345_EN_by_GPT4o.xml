      <p>Greetings. A young man named Berlinus, who delivers this letter from me to you, seemed to me worthy to travel to Zürich for the sake of piety and the letters, which are cultivated there, and therefore I commend him to you on account of his excellent qualities of mind, so that you, who are accustomed to love young men of outstanding talent and integrity, may also love him more warmly, because he has been commended to you by me. For I judge your disposition towards me from my own, which I have towards you, as I am so disposed towards you that I know nothing dear to you that I do not also consider should be dear to me. This Berlinus, as I understand, is being taken away from us by the people of Bern to you because they think we have absurd opinions about ceremonies in our church. In this matter, it greatly pains me that our people and school are spoken of poorly; for as far as I am concerned, you may be assured, most honorable Bullinger, that I strive solely to teach nothing in public lectures and disputations that I do not understand to pertain to the dignity and greatness of our Lord Jesus Christ, nor do I allow myself to be bound to those things which are seen in the elements of the world. Concerning my diligence and faith, the good and pious men who are among us and hear me will give ample testimony. Therefore, I do not think there is any reason why anyone should think it necessary that those who hear us publicly teach the sacred letters should be diverted from us. I will publicly declare my diligence, diligence, and faith in this matter at some point, so that you and those like you may understand that Borrhaus follows a doctrine worthy of the glory of Christ.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, in Basel, and keep this young man commended, November 18th. Martin Borrhaus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zürich, to be respected in Christ.</p>
