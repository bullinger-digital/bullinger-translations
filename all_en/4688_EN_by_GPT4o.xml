      <p>Greetings. Your letter (reverend father in Christ) written on February 20th, in which you recommend an exile, was finally delivered to us on March 2nd. You describe him as an eloquent man, whom we have known to be more than talkative enough.</p>
      <p>If he satisfies us in examination and wishes to be a decent man (which oh, if only!), he might perhaps have a place among our people, where he can greatly assist the church. For we will recommend him to the church in Luzein, in which parts the emperor's prefect presides; provided he is not of unbridled speech; for it is said that he did not conduct himself modestly enough in Sargans.</p>
      <p>In the presence of the prefect at the table, he sang (indeed psalms) and behaved as a soldier, because the local priest was present, whom he did not hesitate to attack with words. I write this, my father, so that you understand that among us there is indeed a great scarcity of suitable people, but a very abundant crop of wanderers. Therefore, we earnestly ask you to recommend to us no one except those whose past life is known to you by certain authorities. But even if you recommend such, direct letters to both Mr. Philippus, my colleague, and to me; I wish this to be done because we must act with common effort. As for Eglin, whom I have known since he was a boy, because he used me as a teacher, I congratulate us; for I promise myself much from the man's modesty and integrity. If you have not yet written to Consul Ambrosius in his name, I do not see what need there is to write. For I do not quite see what could help him now indeed.</p>
      <p>But where is Eglin staying so long, whom I wish to hasten his arrival entirely for certain and serious reasons.</p>
      <p>Therefore, urge the man to expedite himself as soon as possible. If you can do so at your convenience, you would do us a great favor by sending the mandate of the King of France, which we will return through certain people at the first opportunity. Also, inform us whether that mandate has been sent to the princes of Germany and what outcome the Neoburg assemblies have reached, and explain further what you recently hinted at regarding the conspiracy. We are eager to understand all these things from you; if you do not have the time, assign this task to Mr. Johann Rudolf, your son, whom you will simultaneously train in this field. The Bishop of Constance writes to G[regorius] Carl[inus] and among other things also this: "The Lutheran princes are meeting in NÃ¼wenburg in Meissen; it is feared they will not bring about anything good, they are allying against the Muscovites and the future council." This he says; we desire more certain information from you. From Italy, nothing is currently reported except continuous rumors of Turkish terror. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, March 3rd, in the year of our Lord 1561.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we have examined Martin, whom you recommended; but you would not believe how lacking he is in learning, I would almost say in theology he is of no account. To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant head of the church in Zurich, his lord and patron, to be uniquely honored. To Mr. H. Bullinger.</p>
