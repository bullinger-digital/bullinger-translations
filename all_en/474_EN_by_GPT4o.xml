      <p>Most excellent Bullinger.</p>
      <p>We are members of one another because of Him who loved us so much that He gave Himself for our redemption; we cannot help but be concerned about your affairs, especially since we have not received any letters from you for a long time that would inform us of your situation. We see everything being disturbed by the lust of one man, and almost nothing is safe or free anywhere, whether profane or religious, if you prefer. The Lord has given him power not only over his own but also over others; therefore, we must be vigilant not only with human resources but also with the most fervent prayers to God for your safety and that of all churches. If dangers seem to be approaching you, they are not far from us either, and we are indeed in the same boat; for persecution is becoming more insolent here every day. Many are captured, some are condemned to the galleys, some to perpetual imprisonment, and some, alas, are driven to recantation out of fear of punishment; Christ is so weak and almost infantile in all things. Many are also proscribed with their wives and children, and many seek safety in flight, among them a certain bishop named Vergerius, a truly pious and learned man; if he seeks refuge with you, please receive him with the humanity you possess. So much so that I also fear for myself, who, although I have often helped others in this matter, must fear that the same condition may be proposed to me; for God wants the faith of His own to be tested by these calamities and to be led more to the knowledge of Himself.</p>
      <p>But this should console both you and us in a wonderful way, that we are cared for by Him to whom all things are subject, and that everything falls to our salvation, and even death itself is life. In the meantime, let us communicate freely through letters, sharing mutual changes of circumstances, from which it will be easy to infer what the will of the Lord will be, although it is always good and benevolent towards us. Then, so that we can receive some consolation from each other. This happened to me before I sealed such letters. For the letters of the most learned Gisner were delivered, which wonderfully refreshed us all, as from them we perceived that your affairs, with Christ's approval, are in a satisfactory state, as our Lelius, who is with you, also writes. However, I think you are not unaware of how cunning the Emperor's ministers are; do not easily believe their words; they only aim to dissolve your bonds and alliances in any way they can. You have Germany before your eyes, which, although it could not be more united, they have completely distracted with their arts and tricks. Stand united and in agreement among yourselves and, if possible, postpone the cause of religion to another time, so that no opportunity is given to Satan to hunt for the highest. Here, almost no one except the Emperor's supporters does not wish for lasting harmony in your affairs and for things to go well with you, especially since you are certainly loved by these lords; for they wish other republics to stand for a long time. May the Lord protect you and us with His spirit to the praise of His glory.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I commend to you this noble young man born of a pious parent, that you may treat him as you would treat me. When he returns to his own, he can affirm to everyone that the English are loved and highly esteemed by you for their zeal for piety, and at the same time, he will understand that my recommendation to you has had some weight. Farewell in the Lord, and love me, and greet the rest of the church in my name.</p>
      <p>Given on March 24, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Balthasar Altieri.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished in doctrine, piety, and morals, [D.] Heinrich Bullinger, my ever-respected lord. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
