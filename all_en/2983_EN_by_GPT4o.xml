      <p>The letters that you entrusted to Mr. Haller to be delivered to me, dearest Bullinger, have greatly assisted my affairs. For when I came to Bern and found none of my acquaintances there, he took care of everything for me; for he received me most kindly into his hospitality and diligently sought a companion to accompany me to Lausanne. All these things he did because you had mentioned me in your letters to him. Therefore, I thank you for kindly deigning to commend me to such a benevolent man, and I ask you to thank him for the kindness he showed me; I truly declare myself deeply indebted to both of you. May God, the best and greatest, preserve you for a long time as a useful minister to His church! Please, greet in my name Mr. Johann Jakob Wick, my most gracious host.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste, August 12.</p>
      <p>Yours in Christ, Thomas Sampson.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, these are given. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
