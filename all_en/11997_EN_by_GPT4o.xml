    <p xml:id="regest1">After not having composed anything for a long time, he finds it difficult to make verses; following are two distichs laboriously wrested from the Muses. If something better comes to mind, he will send it to Bullinger; the arduous translation from German [into Latin of Zwingli's writings] has dulled his sense for poetry. He shares another distich that has just been created.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I truly now experience that practice makes perfect. For having abstained entirely from writing poetry for several months and not having been engaged in reading poets in the meantime, I now find the Muses more than thin and exhausted, yet more barren because, confined within the narrow limits of the subject, they cannot achieve any freedom to wander more broadly. Nevertheless, I have wrested these two distichs from them, even against their will: Jericho was conquered by trumpets: behold, the city of the demon and the foul kingdoms fall by the voice of the gospel.</p>
      <p>The Baalists perish; the invincible truth remains, so that Elijah cannot be overcome by any art.</p>
      <p>If anything more fitting comes to mind, I will ensure that you have it. Certainly, that troublesome labor of translating German, with which I am now engaged, has almost entirely expelled poetry from my mind. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>While we write this, behold, another is conceived in the mind: What wonder, Jericho fell at the sound of trumpets, when the dominion of the demon falls at the word?</p>
