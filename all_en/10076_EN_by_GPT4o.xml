      <p>Our friendly greetings and all the best in advance, well-educated, wise, especially dear and good friend.</p>
      <p>We have no doubt that you are well aware of what Master Franz Kolb, our preacher, discussed with you in Bremgarten, as well as what Berchtold Haller, also our preacher, wrote to you in recent days. Since a written response from you has now reached the aforementioned Berchtold, from which it is noted with what words and conditions our confederates from Zurich wish to bind you and other proclaimers of God's word, which are indeed disgraceful and, in our opinion, unworthy of any prophet, we are therefore prompted by the favorable opinion we hold of you due to your honorable conduct and Christian teaching, to hereby kindly request you, if it is agreeable to you and you would like to be with us as much as we desire and wish to have your person, that you arrange yourself with this our messenger sent to you alone, to lead our church in the proclamation of God's word; we are willing to come to an agreement with you regarding the nourishment and well-being of your body, so that you shall have a good satisfaction from us.</p>
      <p>Dated in haste, December 11, 1531.</p>
      <p>The Mayor and Council of Bern.</p>
      <p>To the well-educated wise Master Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of God's word, currently in Zurich, or wherever he may be found, our dear and good friend.</p>
