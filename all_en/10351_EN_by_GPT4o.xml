    <p xml:id="regest1">There are rumors of machinations against the Reformed faith. Initially, Zurich should be won over so that Bern can be attacked more easily afterward. He asks Bullinger to promote the unity between Zurich and Bern. In Bern, things are going well in both the city and the countryside; they look forward to a possible war with confidence. He does not need to mention his name. He requests the confidentiality of the message.</p>

      <p>Peace and grace from God our Father and His Son, our Savior, be with you.</p>
      <p>Dear Lord and Brother, I want to let you know that I hear that some people are plotting against a pious city of Zurich, who are not of our faith, but if they could and might eradicate it, they would do so. If they could overcome a pious city of Zurich, they could more easily attack a pious city of Bern or other Christian people; for some people, I hear in the countryside, are indicating that the new heretical faith must be eradicated, as they call it, and the old papal faith restored. Therefore, I urge you, dear shepherd and brother in Christ, to be vigilant so that the evil enemy does not bring it about that a city of Zurich and a city of Bern become disunited. Also, I want to let you know that things are going well in both the city and the countryside of Bern. I am in good hope: if someone wants to attack us for the sake of faith, it will go well for us who are loyal to the divine word. God will not forsake us. Let us not be frightened. God says: whoever is burdened, come to me, I will make his burden light.</p>
      <p>With that, be entrusted to God. May God increase the true faith in us.</p>
      <p>Given on the 27th day of January in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>I would have gladly written my name to you; however, it is not necessary. If there is anything good to learn from this writing, do it and keep it secret; therefore, I ask you for God's sake. Amen.</p>
      <p>To the honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, in his hand.</p>
