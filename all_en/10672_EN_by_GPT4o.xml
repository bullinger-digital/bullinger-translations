    <p xml:id="regest1">When they were admitted to the council in their dispute with the [Anabaptist] goldsmith [Rosenbaum], after initial resistance from the mayor of Waldkirch, and demanded a disputation, they were once again insulted by their opponent; they maintain - although mediators were employed - their demands for a disputation and a court proceeding.</p>

      <p>Dear and faithful brothers, following your advice, our superiors have approached the mayor of Waldkirch on our behalf, who did not want to grant us an audience, but nevertheless listened very favorably to our opponent, and also did not want to let us come before the council until he himself brings the matter before the council. As a result, we and the goldsmith were hindered on August 28. We have demanded an open discussion, for which many reasons (grounds) were given.</p>
      <p>Our opponent appeared (stepped forward) and insulted us even more than before. Because of such a difficult matter, they have appointed people to amicably resolve the matter. However, we have protested, not wanting to accept any other settlement than solely maintaining the public discussion, and also the right against the goldsmith. Thus, we parted ways. We did not want to withhold this from you. But we can well perceive (see) that the goldsmith has great support. We ask you to let us know your good thoughts and advice on this matter.</p>
      <p>Dated Schaffhausen, [28th] August 1535.</p>
      <p>Brothers, who proclaim the Gospel of Christ in Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and equally learned brothers, pastors and readers of the Church of Zurich.</p>
