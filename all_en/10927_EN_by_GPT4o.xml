    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the response to the letter [from August 19, No. 879]; agrees with Bullinger's criticism [of the Strasbourg theologians] and hopes that Luther's [moderate] view will also prevail among his followers. Requests the return of his previous letter.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>I am grateful to you for the letters you sent to me. As for why my letters were sent later, you have understood the reason from them, if I am not mistaken. However, I agree with you that those excellent men are unfortunate in explaining this matter, which I have testified to them more than once in person, and not the least, since they are so ardent and frequent in no other matter, and certainly more than once they have used my assistance, however small it may be. And I seem to myself to understand Luther's mind well (as it is now and as he claims he has always had it). If only all Lutherans and the entire Lutheran people understood it!</p>
      <p>What I recently wrote to you has completely slipped my mind except for the subject, so I ask you for the letter I wrote. Furthermore, farewell and pray to the Lord for me and for this entire matter.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, August 28, 1536.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed brother. In Zurich.</p>
