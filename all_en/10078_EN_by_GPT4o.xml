      <p>Noble, steadfast, honorable, pious, prudent, wise, gracious, and dear lords, my willing service and whatever I know to do for your good and pleasure beforehand.</p>
      <p>First, I thank God through Jesus Christ [Romans 1:8], that He has kept your honorable wisdom in His word, and I pray from the heart that He may continue to strengthen you.</p>
      <p>Since your wisdom has written to me, a humble, unworthy, and undeserving person, so humbly and comfortingly, desiring me also to be your preacher, I express my great thanks to your wisdom, and I will not forget your honor, loyalty, and love for eternity, but with all my ability, wherever I might and can, repay with loyalty, obedience, and utmost diligence. Know also that if God had arranged it so that I could have served you, my gracious lords of Bern, to whom I have always borne a special heart, as to wise, God-fearing, and faithful ones, then it would not have required any request, and still does not, wherever I might serve your wisdom.</p>
      <p>But now God has arranged it so that my lords of Zürich have accepted me, to whom I have been bound for some years with an oath, as I have also precisely reported to Master Frantz in Bremgarten. They have also always received their preachers according to the divine word and freely allowed them to preach, as sent to Lord Berchtold. Therefore, I ask that your honorable wisdom not be angry with me, for I could not have acted otherwise for the sake of honor. I also have not less recommended myself to you; for it is just now the case, I still wish to be a Bernese and yours with favor and loyal services, wherever I can.</p>
      <p>As for the messenger, he did not delay, but hastily and faithfully delivered the letters yesterday between 7 and 8 in the morning.</p>
      <p>With that, I commend your wisdom to God, who may keep you in honor, peace, and prosperity for a long time.</p>
      <p>Dated Zürich, December 14, 1531.</p>
      <p>Your wisdom's obedient</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the noble, steadfast, pious, prudent, and wise lords, the mayors and council of the city of Bern, my gracious and dear lords.</p>
