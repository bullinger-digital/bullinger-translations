      <p>Pious, honorable, especially gracious lord and trusted dear brother-in-law, my willing service and all good things be with you, etc. Above all, I wish you, your dear wife, and dear children the blessing of God; may He grant you this new and many good years and graciously preserve you at all times. Thereafter, I thank you for all the honor, kindness, and goodness you continually show to my dear people in Berg, with the offer that, should I be able to show you and yours love and service, I would willingly do so at any time. Herewith, I send you a pair of simnel cakes and a bottle of wine, which my gracious lord, bailiff Steiger in Bern, sent me from a barrel of his produce that he has in Rolle; in addition, I have included 2 pieces of Hessian venison; for my gracious prince and lord, the old Landgrave, sent me a little barrel. I ask that you kindly receive this from me as a token of gratitude for the kindness shown to my son, and continue to hold us in brotherly love. I also ask that you wish my gracious lord of Rheinau many good years and always commend us to his grace. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, December 24, 1566.</p>
