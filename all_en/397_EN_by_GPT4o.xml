      <p>May God grant you and yours many good years, amen. I have understood your letter and reported the matter to the mayor, who informed me that he would bring the matter to my lords if it is possible for them. Meanwhile, and until Mr. Hans receives another decision, he should stay in Ramsen and continue to serve the church as before; for his departure might indicate abandonment, as if my lords intended to withdraw immediately. We hope entirely that nothing will happen to him.</p>
      <p>The situation is as follows: my lords are very willing to support you faithfully on the Rhine and help bravely; otherwise, I truly cannot understand, and a plan has been made to organize around 300 men for you, who will march to Stein if necessary. The governor has also been written to about what is expected from him, and we await the response from the messenger, etc. The people of Bern are well-prepared and willing from the heart; for my lords have also sent them warnings. The intelligence has also been spread and partly found that there is no armament there; yet we remain vigilant nonetheless.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow morning, two of my lords' messengers, the one from Cham and Mr. Blüwler, will ride to Zofingen; there, Bern will meet them with two messengers and Schaffhausen with two messengers. From there, they will ride to the seven places from place to place, to give a response to the seven places' intentions; it is well established. Basel writes today that, while they desire a written response from the seven places, the three places, however, are willing to make an oral presentation, they will send their response in letters to the seven places and no messengers; yet they will not trust us in any way, nor otherwise from us, but faithfully support at all times, that we may have peace.</p>
      <p>They have also written to Stockach, and my gracious lords have ordered to seek the three court days, but only to resolve and not to engage further. This is done for the benefit of those from Ramsen. Meanwhile, within four weeks, a friendly day will be held in Diessenhofen between the king's men and my lords, to try how the matter can be amicably helped. My lord Hab, the mayor, the city clerk, and Mr. Jörg Müller are appointed for this. And since we are informed and right against others, we hope that no violence will be initiated and used; otherwise, God willing; we will then do what is honorable. I have reported this to you in haste, to inform Mr. Hansen, and that you greet him kindly from me and mine, telling him that I am willing to serve and help him at all times as my dear brother; for he deserves with his honesty that everyone is justly kind to him. God protect you, your honorable wife; mine greet her along with my whole household. January 4, 1549.</p>
      <p>Philip, Prince of Spain, has come to Milan, intending to proceed to Germany; for the ailing Emperor, with his affairs flourishing, desires to make him King of Germany, whom they call Roman, and rightly so; for we Germans wish to preserve that Roman Empire, which our fathers attacked. Meanwhile, the Emperor has sent to Maurice and his brother Augustus; Maurice is said to have received it and complains that the nobles and his people do not want to accept it, hence war is believed to be imminent against the Saxons and the maritime cities, which also persist. Farewell.</p>
      <p>To the pious and faithful Mr. Hans Stumpf, dean in Stammheim, his trusted, dear lord and brother. Stammheim.</p>
