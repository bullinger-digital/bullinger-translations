      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have carried out what you instructed regarding the banished ones.</p>
      <p>You have a copy of what we responded to our council concerning the Saxon convention. Capito requested that we write friendly letters. We have written them. Here you also have a copy of these.</p>
      <p>We do not know what is being decided in Aarau. Pray to the Lord that all may turn out well.</p>
      <p>Convey my greetings a thousand times to Grynaeus. You will share all this with him. Being very busy, I could not write more.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>April 30, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>We can accept the confession of the four cities and we have accepted it.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, dearest brother. In Basel.</p>
