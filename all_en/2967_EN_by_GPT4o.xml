      <p>My Bullinger, greetings. From Sarmatia, singular benevolence compels me to write to you, with which I regard you. I came here in the span of 24 days, but I hastened a little, because it was necessary.</p>
      <p>I found everything milder and more civilized than I had thought, the sky, the land, the people, especially the prince. Believe me, H. Bullinger, all of Germany does not have such a prince, whether you consider piety, learning, or prudence. May God preserve him longer for the glory of His name. He received me far more honorably than I wished, and now he is entirely focused on binding me so that I cannot leave here anymore. I am ashamed to write how much he promises me, lest I seem to acknowledge or give the suspicion that I consider myself worthy of them, which I certainly am not. I replied clearly that God had given me the position in which I have been so far, and that I do not wish to abandon it.</p>
      <p>There are still some contentions in these churches, but I hope they will be settled, and there are also wars now between this prince and the Livonians, but peace is being negotiated, and perhaps it will succeed.</p>
      <p>I greeted Dr. Melanchthon with my words, who, when he was to dine with me, brought with him your son, your guest, and the two Collin brothers. Thus, you seemed to me to love your countrymen. He was delighted to hear about the upcoming assembly on the matter of religion, and I too would be delighted if I either certainly hoped it would happen or if people would bring moderate minds to it. The affairs of Poland are not as fervent as they were thought to be; indeed, there are some among the leading men of the kingdom who are favorable; but the power of the bishops is flourishing, and the king clearly supports them along with the entire papacy. However, a diet will be held at Bartholomew's, which I will also attend if I hear it is being held seriously. I hope to be in Swabia before the beginning of the next year, if God wills.</p>
      <p>Perhaps these will be brought to you by Dr. Timotheus Gersovius, the secretary of this most illustrious prince. If he brings them, I beg and beseech you to ensure he is received honorably, as is your custom. He is certainly favored by the prince. I bid Dr. Gualther and Dr. Gasner to be well, whose books, along with yours, I saw both in the private and public, most well-stocked library of the prince. I bid your three sons-in-law and the whole family to be well. If Dr. Martyr is now with you, I also bid him especially to be well. Pray for me. The grace and peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all, amen.</p>
      <p>From Königsberg, 20th of July, 1556.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, honorable brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
