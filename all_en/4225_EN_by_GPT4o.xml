      <p>Greetings. Before the calends of March, I received your letter, most beloved father in Christ, from which I truly recognized your paternal love towards me. You congratulate my happiness in the solid recognition of sincere truth, which you eagerly desire to be confirmed in me by the Holy Spirit. Certainly, the Lord God, the diligent guardian, avenger, protector, and eternal preserver of His creatures, will not break or crush the bruised reed in me, but like a kind and generous head of the family, He will grant more to the one who has, so that I may be more abundant, richer, and more opulent in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>I, in turn, will pray to the Lord to keep you strong and safe in peace, humanity, and love of neighbor, to strengthen and establish you. Regarding your school, as you wrote, I am more than satisfied, and I greatly rejoice that you are so adorned with learned and pious professors, teachers, and assistant teachers, that they are always in expectation and not few. But in this affliction and cruel persecution, we do not attempt to snatch bread from your mouths, but lovingly ask to be satisfied with crumbs and fragments.</p>
      <p>For the day before I completed this letter to you, the envoys of the princes came to us from Montbéliard and, beyond necessity and all truth, imperiously forced us to their ceremonies. Our Erbius, Regius, Myliagrius, and another certain... ttius remained steadfast; the rest, with carnal and confident Peter, shamefully denied God. I have nothing to transcribe about Bartholomäus Westhemer except this one thing, that he defected from us as a traitor and shared an inheritance with Judas the betrayer.</p>
      <p>Regarding the persecution, which was great and cruel, I do not elaborate in my great occupations and affairs; you have Myliagrius present, who will explain everything to you in person. You can read and understand the rest from their reformation, which we extorted from their hands. Now, farewell in Christ Jesus with all the learned and pious.</p>
      <p>In Riquewihr, on the 7th day of March in the year 1560.</p>
      <p>Karl Fabricius.</p>
      <p>My father, I ask you to write back to your son briefly. To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
