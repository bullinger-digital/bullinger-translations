      <p>Greetings. Meanwhile, I have received your letters, both those you sent through Franz Rambolet and those through Samuel Tilmann, the steward of Zofingen. I thank you for your diligence, and all of ours thank you as well.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, Diesbach left here to head to the Hermitage. He is instructed to resolve and help as much as possible, especially to speak earnestly with the Confederates, so that they remain just, or else we will have to do what the agreements allow, and then also to negotiate with the three cities, especially about a day, so that we might come together once and also see how we might prepare for any arising matters. It seems to me that ours have never been as serious about the matter as now; they have the worm in their nose; for there is indeed too much arrogance and defiance, and it is clear that no kindness will help. From France, we have received nothing else yet, except what I heard from our chief scribe Zerkinte, that the queen mother has severely reproached the Cardinal of Ferrara for trying to hinder the colloquium with such force; she said: "We no longer want the misery in France, which has been so long. We want to know once and not guess what the truth is." Every day, people are sent from the cities everywhere, asking for ministers from us. We grant them so many that our churches are almost deserted; yesterday, 6 more were sent away.</p>
      <p>Dr. Viret has also gone to Nîmes.</p>
      <p>From Geneva, it is written that the private mass has already been dealt with; now they are dealing with public communion. May the Lord grant grace and success! Please, write diligently about the Rhaetian and Hermetic matters. Diesbach will finally head to you on his return; he was sent alone; Emanuel is bedridden. All of ours, Treasurer Haller, Hagius, Dilger, the Zehenders, my father-in-law, Musculus, greet you in return. Steiger is not at home.</p>
      <p>Give my regards to your family and all the brothers in my name. I do not have time to write to my brother now; therefore, greet him for me.</p>
      <p>Bern, October 15, at nightfall, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, my lord and compatriot, to be loved with perpetual respect.</p>
