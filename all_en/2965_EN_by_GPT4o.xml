      <p>Greetings. Without heart, most excellent father Bullinger, who can think and speak? Truly, you have my heart, and what of my affairs could be hidden from you? You have finally taken my heart Martyr from me; you have him, you have me. Therefore, there is no need for you to expect anything else from me, nor to ask how I am doing, or what I am doing, especially at present, where neither the ability to speak is granted nor the will.</p>
      <p>I am in the middle here. Consider my misery, as I am torn into so many parts. What is more, Peter Martyr is now divided by you; for Peter is with you, the martyrdom remains with me. Therefore, farewell and rejoice; we, however, will sit and weep by the rivers of Babylon for a while, until we are freed from captivity and return to our own city, Zion. I commend myself to your prayers.</p>
      <p>From the Hermitage of Straßburg, July 11, late at night. I greet everyone with one word. [Greek].</p>
      <p>To the most excellent pastor of the Zürich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most revered father. Zürich.</p>
