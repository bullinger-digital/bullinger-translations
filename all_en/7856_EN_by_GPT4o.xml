      <p>Recently, I was summoned to a certain village for the purpose of preaching, as the time and day for writing back was approaching.</p>
      <p>Our German schoolmaster, a diligent man, was summoned by our envoy on the most sacred day of the Lord's Passion, early in the morning, to write down certain things that would contribute to the declaration of the battle that had been engaged. He wrote down an example from the hand of the interpreter Balthasar, which I subsequently inspected. However, when the schoolmaster hesitated in writing down certain French names, he was advised to continue, and he replied that he could not quite grasp some things; for he wished to carefully note these true new things. The envoy, smiling, inquired what the schoolmaster was saying, and burst into laughter, making it quite clear in every way how much he believed, etc.</p>
      <p>- I wonder what the Transylvanian, who is hosted by Mr. Lemann, has been doing here in recent months. I fear that he is being supported at the envoy's expense and, if he can find out anything in Zurich from many, he immediately reports it to the envoy's ears. - What I have recently received from Italy, I send in letters to Mr. Ruinelli; Lentulus has nothing yet. Count Ulysses Martinengo is returning to Chiavenna, leaving Morbegno, whose church's state is most deplorable. A papal prefect has been appointed there, and it will not be long before the faithful are driven out. I do not wish to burden you now with the state of our church.</p>
