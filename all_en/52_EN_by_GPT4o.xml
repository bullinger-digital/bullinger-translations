    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger received the two letters from Myconius [18033 and 18037 from February 14 and 18, 1548] bundled together.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Myconius' fears about the French King Henry II are justified. Bullinger would reject an alliance with him, as he is evidently allowing the cruelest persecution of the Protestants. Many hate Emperor Charles V because of his bloodthirstiness and are more inclined towards Henry II, as if he spared [the Protestants]! But both are enemies of Christ, who must be equally avoided by [the Protestant Swiss Confederates], unless one wishes to perish with both in this world and the next.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Around February 1 [correctly: February 4], a certain Octavien Blondel, a respected Frenchman, was slowly burned in Paris, who had been captured in Lyon in the presence of St. Gallen merchants [N.N.] in a public inn. At the request of these merchants, the councils of Zurich, Bern, and St. Gallen had previously intervened in writing for the prisoner. Whether these petitions were delivered or not: According to Joachim Vadian's letter [18038], the good man was burned. Such spectacles are being staged!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Constance is persistently hoping for reconciliation with the Emperor. May the negotiations have a good outcome for Constance and a better one than Bullinger [secretly] fears.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">There is a rumor that Philip II, the son of Charles V, has landed in Genoa: Thus, he will be impossible to intercept by [enemy] ships. He is to be installed as Roman King. The Spaniards want to rule and the Germans welcome them! Let them enjoy their obedience!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Philip of Hesse and John Frederick I of Saxony are soon to be released from imperial captivity.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Charles V ordered cannons to be shipped from Frankfurt am Main over the Rhine to the Netherlands. Perhaps he wants to threaten the Danish King Christian III with them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Greetings. Bullinger is currently unable to write more.</p>

      <p>Your fears about the French King Henry II are justified. I would not want us to be allied with him. It is certain that he is allowing the cruelest persecution of the Gospel. Many hate Emperor Charles V as a bloodthirsty tyrant, and they are more inclined towards Henry II as if he were more merciful. But I see both as enemies of Christ, both of whom we must equally avoid, unless we wish to perish with them in this world and the next.</p>

      <p>Around the beginning of February, a certain Octavien Blondel, a noble Frenchman, was slowly burned in Paris, having been captured in Lyon at a public inn in the presence of St. Gallen merchants. The merchants ensured that the councils of Zurich, Bern, and St. Gallen wrote on behalf of the captive. Whether the letters were suppressed or not, Vadianus writes that the good man was burned! Such spectacles are being staged, etc.</p>

      <p>Constance is persistently hoping to be received mercifully by the Emperor. May their negotiations have a good outcome, and better than I think they will.</p>

      <p>It is rumored that the son of the Emperor has landed in Genoa. Thus, he will not be intercepted or captured by the prepared ships. He will be created, as the rumor goes, King of the Romans. The Spaniards want to rule. The Germans gladly accept them. Let them enjoy their obedience.</p>

      <p>It is thought that Philip of Hesse and John Frederick I of Saxony will soon be released by the Emperor.</p>

      <p>The Emperor ordered cannons to be transported from Frankfurt am Main down the Rhine to the Lower Germany. Perhaps he threatens the Danish King.</p>
