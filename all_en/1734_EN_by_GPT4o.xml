      <p>To the man distinguished both in piety and learning, Mr. Bullinger, H[enry] Sidall of Oxford sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Last year, most esteemed man, I received letters from your kindness on behalf of this young man from Ulm, which were by many accounts most pleasing to me, but, if I may speak the truth, unnecessary. For his piety, integrity of character, and zeal for good letters had already so bound me to him that I considered it a favor received if I could confer anything upon him. For wherever I find such character, he cannot but be most dear to me, regardless of whose he may be; for I utterly detest that προσωποληψία (partiality). In these most ample halls, my little help could benefit him; but my spirit was always most ready, and I always promise the same to him, provided he does not change his character (which God forbid). But now that he has returned to you and is very uncertain (as it seemed) about returning to England, I do not see how I can be of any help to him in the future, unless perhaps I can persuade your clemency to pursue him with greater benevolence and love than before, which I most ardently request from your piety. For his character in this most populous society of learned men has always been so candid, so unpolished, so obedient to all our statutes and domestic laws, that he has most justly deserved the highest praise from all, and more than paternal love from me. Moreover, his prudence has been greatly approved by me, as it has so adapted itself to our customs that he could never justly be criticized as a barbarian by anyone, but has deservedly obtained praise from all as mindful of the law and the region. I have considered it my duty to faithfully inform your excellence of these things, lest any suspicion arise in you that he conducted himself here otherwise than befits a most honorable young man.</p>
      <p>About our Oxford academy and the restoration of religion and the number of the pious among us, I would have gladly written a few things to you at present, if this young man could not have reported everything to you better at leisure. Let your piety most certainly know that many among us are most closely united to you in spirit, even if separated by seas and lands, among whom I wish to be considered first; for I will yield to none in this matter, even if I am much inferior in other gifts. Farewell in the Lord. At Oxford, in the church called Christ's, on the fourth day before the Nones of October.</p>
      <p>To the man adorned with letters and piety, Mr. Bullinger, his most dear. In Zürich.</p>
