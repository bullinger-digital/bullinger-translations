    <p xml:id="regest1">Since [Johannes] Stumpf in his chronicle not only intends to list events but is also keen to explore the causes of those events, the customs of the peoples, and even the origin and usage of words, Vadian has decided to precede his account of the bishops and abbots [of St. Gallen] with a treatise [“On the Monastic Order”] that reports on the origin and development of monasticism in the [Middle Ages]. This can only serve piety. For if one does not want to give the impression that one approves of everything that has happened in the last five centuries, or considers all the depicted minor [monastic] lords as holy, then one must not only string together mere facts but also explain them and present their development and significance. However, Vadian has revealed the foolishness [of the monks] in this introductory treatise with the greatest caution, so much so that he even hopes for the applause of the better monks, especially since he always referred to undisputed sources (including the Church Fathers) and cited the respective passages in the margins to give no one cause for criticism. - Vadian believes that for all these reasons, his treatise should be included in [Stumpf's] work. Everyone would be able to see what changes the greed and impudence of these [monks] have caused in the church. Even the monks, who are lovers of chronicles, could be encouraged to lead a more pious life when reading Stumpf's chronicle if they also got to read [Vadian's] interwoven treatise on monasticism (which they would otherwise not read separately). - Where there was something to report that might be too harsh for them, the events were presented with moderate words, and quotes from other authors, such as Bernard [of Clairvaux], Jerome, and Augustine, were also cited, which no one will likely criticize. If one were not allowed to raise contradictions or introduce polemics in a chronicle, one could no longer record the course of events, and historiography would lose credibility; however, mild statements are preferable to categorical ones. In light of these considerations, Vadian has not questioned the monastic order itself in his treatise. Instead, he speaks of reformation, which no one can reproach him for, as even the monks and priests recognize its necessity. Vadian has not addressed the mass, the images, the Eucharist, or the veneration of saints, as he had no reason to. The enlightened readers will understand what is meant, but it is not the historian's task to impose his own opinion on others in a harsh manner on controversial issues. Vadian has always mentioned the cantons [of Inner Switzerland] honorably, and where he had something to criticize about monks and nuns, he referred to Brother Niklaus [von Flüe], who adhered to the strictest and oldest hermit rule. - Vadian has reported on Saint Gallus and the not always exemplary monastic state cautiously but always faithfully, as befits a devotee of historical truth. The equally faithfully composed biographical directory of all abbots [“The Little Chronicle of the Abbots”] will soon be received by Bullinger as soon as the writing is copied. Vadian, who only received Stumpf's account of these abbots with gratitude after beginning his own work, had to change some things in his account to avoid repetitions. - Bullinger should, as in the case of other writings, pass on Vadian's treatise [“On the Monastic Order”], which he composed despite a heavy workload during the past summer, to Stumpf. If Bullinger and Stumpf deem it worthy of publication, it should appear under Stumpf's name, as it would be better if Stumpf's chronicle came out under one name only. However, if Vadian's treatise causes offense, Vadian's name should be mentioned as the author in the preface of the chronicle. At the end of the preface, the reader should be prepared to read some things that had to be written for the sake of truth. But Stumpf will probably know this. - Vadian completely submits to the judgment of Bullinger and Stumpf. If the publication of this treatise is postponed, the manuscript should be sent back. [Johannes] Kessler, who has read it thoroughly, says there is nothing like it in the German language; however, he is probably not impartial... - The treatise, which Vadian quickly and extensively wrote, comprises two “books of paper” [50 sheets, i.e., 100 pages], which would correspond to only [50 pages] with a more careful copy. Furthermore, Vadian does not know whether the Zurich [book] censors would allow a publication about St. Gallen abbots, especially since Zurich is the protector of the St. Gallen monastery. However, in matters of faith, the Zurich authorities are hardly bound to the monastery, especially since Abbot Kaspar [von Breitenlandenberg] [1442-1457] did not regulate religious matters in the land rights treaty of 1451, which he voluntarily concluded with the four [Swiss] places [Zurich, Lucerne, Schwyz, and Glarus], and the [Zurich censors] will probably have no objections to a reliable and yet cautious presentation of the events, especially if it serves the cause of the [Protestants].</p>

      <p>Since I saw that our Stumpf, a most courteous and learned man, was also engaged in his noble work, the chronicle, not only to bring forth the history of many things but also to seek the origin of the customs of peoples and even of words and usages, it seemed worthwhile to me to precede the description of the deeds of bishops and abbots with a general and somewhat more detailed narrative or exposition on monasticism and the state of all monasteries, especially in those early and particularly the middle times when Christianity was imported into Germany. This would serve piety among those who are ignorant of good letters, and they would rightly receive the series and knowledge of these things, which perhaps they have not even tasted in any of their books. For it is absolutely necessary to ensure that everything is not presented nakedly and without grace, but that we shed light on things: what they are, where they come from, and where they should be placed, so that they can be in the open; lest you seem to approve the words and deeds of these actors if you report nakedly what they have designated in the last and nearest five centuries with such disturbance of all things and such overthrow of purer discipline and doctrine; which would especially happen if you place catalogs and hold them as if in the place of holy men, those whom you have depicted as worthy of immortal human memory with such a description. For this little glory they themselves have sought in those monastic histories or chronicles, and no monks have spent more oil in any labor, and, as it is said, they have fallen from the donkey more. Therefore, in the first part of my labors, I opposed their foolishness with as much industry, prudence, and moderation as I could, fearing nothing, but that all things would have great favor with readers or even the better monks, because we have indicated everywhere with the names of authors prefixed and places partly indicated, partly brought into the open, that nothing has been brought from our own, but that the history has been composed from others, which the laws of princes and the undoubted monuments of times, moreover the testimonies of learned and most pious fathers cited from everywhere, faithfully rendered in German, prove to be true. I have begun, as you will see, almost from the very elements and little words, so that the narrative may proceed more faithfully, which explanations of this kind, if applied moderately, make not only clear but also pleasing, and there is nothing in the places placed in the margins (as we say) attributed to ostentation, but only to proof. The villages also have not unlearned men everywhere, who would easily hiss at our things unless they saw with what patrons and with what great authority of witnesses our cause, brought into the open for the sake of truth, was supported. For the sake of these, I thought these very things, however great they are, should be inserted into other parts of that work, so that they might be openly admonished that they do not think rightly, who believe to be true or old and undoubted, what has been introduced into the world recently by the lust and audacity of those men, and that the face of the old holy churches was far different from the present one, beset with so many blemishes and stains. I thought, however, that a most fortunate opportunity was offered to our Stumpf to promote piety among them, so that, since it cannot be doubted that they will voraciously devour the narration of things so magnificently done by him, they could not pass by this placed bait without touching and tasting it. If they were published separately under any favorable title, none of them would read it; inserted into the chronicle work and reduced into history, no one will pass it by. Furthermore, to offend less delicate and morose and wrongly affected readers, it was taken care of with great industry, which you will smell immediately in the very titles of the mimes. Wherever harsher things are narrated, we make others speak or bring in the authors themselves who indeed wrote, and we do not spare words, so that the harshness may be more mitigated. In this matter, the freedom of Saint Bernard, with which he inveighed against bishops and abbots, was wonderfully useful to us. The authority of the old holy fathers, especially Jerome and Augustine, also made it so that I think it cannot be turned to anyone's fault, what is exposed in the first two titles and chapters. For if things that are conflicting with dissonant and conflicting things should not be reported in a chronicle work, no series of ages could indeed be handed down and described in any book, and the history would necessarily be deprived of its credibility. However, this work was also given to some, so that we might diminish a little more what could have been said precisely. For I did not want to urge this part, so that I might seem to be about to abolish monasticism, which would have been very odious; but I used the term reformation, which they themselves, when mention of monks and priests arises, gladly use and freely acknowledge, that there is something in them that needs to be amended and brought into order. I have nowhere, as far as I know, touched on the mass, images, the Eucharist, or the suffrages of the saints, nor was there any reason to touch on them. I have hinted at some things obliquely, which will satisfy the nosy reader. I have especially taken care not to interpose my judgment more harshly in any matter more controversially; but I have gladly, as if hesitating, referred the knowledge to others, content myself to have reported the matter as it is, which indeed is the sole duty of history. Therefore, I often commit the parts of the controversy to the parts, so that it may be known with what causes and arguments they use, who claim to have been stirred up to inveigh and accuse by right. Everywhere I extol the villages with magnificent titles, and since I deal against the monastic work and against the monks and nuns, I draw Brother Klaus with special diligence as the one who has been guided and found according to the best rule of the oldest hermits, etc.</p>
      <p>What I have brought about Saint Gall and the state of the monastery has been rendered with great fidelity, and in all these things, truth and candor have been given with all moderation, which could be given to the monastic matter, not everywhere pure and holy. The truth itself should neither be detracted from nor can it be, especially by him who reveres the holy faith of history. For this has been done in the catalog of abbots with the greatest care by me, which you yourself will soon know; for I will send the description, I think, soon, not without the history of both ancient and recent deeds. Many things had to be changed by me, so that I would not replace the same thing with our Stumpf, which he himself indeed most digestively handed down. For when I began to write, I had not yet seen his books, and he himself deemed it worthy, so that he would not be burdened to approach me, lest we confuse one labor with another and I myself do what is said to be done; which indeed was done with my great gratitude, which I owe to this most courteous man. But I beg you, my Bullinger, to send both my other works and at the same time that lucubration, born with me in the greatest business this past summer, to Stumpf, so that he may read it and judge it together with you; and if you deem it worthy of being published, take care that it is published in his name, so that the book does not bear more than one author, rightly going forth into the light under one name. But if he judges some things to be more odious than to be thought worthy of being published under his name, I will not be burdened if he throws everything onto my head and in the preface of the work (for in that place he will be able to do so conveniently), freely warns in the description of which things my work has been assisted; for I would not want the best man to be burdened with any suspicion of anything that could be troublesome to him. Moreover, in general, it will be very necessary to mitigate the reader, and indeed at the end of the preface, - lest anyone consults badly if anything is either written or said against anyone, the faith of the things narrated demanding it. In which, however, Master Stumpf does not need me as a monitor; he knows better than I do what needs to be done. As for me, I will acquiesce in your judgment in general; only take care that, if you decide to refrain from publishing at present, those little things of mine, which I indeed wrote incidentally, but described with greater labor, return to me and do not perish altogether. Kessler has reviewed it, denying that he has seen this material treated in German by anyone so far, to which I indeed easily agree. But whether I have treated it well and rightly or otherwise, it will be your judgment; for his is so vitiated by love that it is not safe to acquiesce.</p>
      <p>The book has two books of paper. Another would have written it on one; I write badly and with wide-spaced writing. We have also doubted whether your appointed ones would allow the books, which are to go out in print, concerning the history of the abbots and the St. Gallen monastery, to be printed or not, since your lords of Zurich are also the protectors of the mentioned monastery. But I do not hear that in matters of faith, the monastery is bound or obligated anywhere. I know well that in the letter of the land and city rights, which Abbot Caspar voluntarily took up with the four places, religion is excepted and set aside above all things, at the instigation of the abbot, and it is only temporarily agreed upon. So I believe no one will object that true and undeniable histories, which are written and described with all gentleness, without any hatred and ill will, solely to complete the history, may or should be placed and let go for the above-mentioned reasons, especially for the advancement and good of our religion. But you yourself will decide and take care of this. Farewell. St. Gallen, the day before the Kalends of October, in the year of our Lord 1545. - Take the hastily written letter in good part. Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most ample church of Zurich, lord and most esteemed friend.</p>
