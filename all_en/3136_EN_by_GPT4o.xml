      <p>Greetings. I had hoped to send you all the previous pages on occasion before I finally put an end to it; but due to the upcoming fairs and the fact that we have been without couriers until now, I could not send anything and had to bring the booklet to completion. Therefore, if there happens to be anything that needs correction, which I have diligently tried to prevent, you will bear it with equanimity and ensure that the few copies I send to you are corrected with a pen. I am sending only 12, which I give to you as a gift, although I owe you more and would gladly send more if you wish. However, it was necessary to print only 800 due to the brevity of time; otherwise, it would not have been possible to complete it because of other works that still occupy the presses. Farewell and please convey my greetings to Theodor, Frisius, Gesner, and Gualther on occasion.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 27, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Oporinus from the heart.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed lord and friend. Zürich.</p>
