    <p xml:id="regest1">In his remarks [on the nature of the body of Christ], he has real opponents in mind: not only the Scholastics, who teach the physical presence of Christ in the sacrament and thereby question the spatial limitation, i.e., the human nature of his body, but also those highly educated Anabaptists who misinterpret the Holy Scripture out of contentiousness. The concern expressed from another side, [Zwingli and his followers] took the true presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper too lightly, is understandable, although it has only been expressed differently, not denied. Christ is distant and yet present, similar to the sun, but his presence can only be grasped in faith. The body and blood of Christ can be received by believers only in an essential way; not in a carnal, but in a spiritual manner, where we must look not at the signs, but at the matter itself.</p>

      <p>[...] Perhaps I seem to you, Bullinger, like a blindfolded gladiator swinging a sword in the dark, without an opponent to strike or fight against, since what I argue and demand, no one will deny. Would that it were so, and that there were none who persist in rekindling that old controversy about the humanity of Christ! For, to say nothing of the Scholastics, who unite the true flesh of Christ with the visible species of the sacrament naturally, denying local presence and yet teaching that such a body of Christ is consecrated and received everywhere, that is, in all churches, and do not realize how greatly they oppose the truth of the flesh, it is well known that the most learned Anabaptists, even those skilled in languages, have revived many doctrines of ancient heresies with astonishing confidence, and today there are not lacking those endowed with both talent and learning, who, driven by the same madness, contemplate nothing milder than their predecessors. For many, contention adds spirit, while in their lust for argument they dare anything and gather from all sides, even from twisted and strangled scriptures, whatever they can to achieve victory by any means.</p>
      <p>However, we take kindly to the suspicion of those who, seeing us assert with Augustine and the ancients that the body of the Lord is in a certain place, feared that we might commit something too rash concerning the Eucharist, taught that the body of the Lord is truly present and truly received in the assembly, and at the same time condemned the empty use of signs. For our people have not thought otherwise than they do, even if we have varied with different forms of speech, which nevertheless have themselves produced more dissension than has been beneficial for piety. However that matter stands, we say it does not follow that to assert the true and locatable nature in Christ we must concede that Jesus Christ, God and man, is not truly and substantially and even corporally present in every assembly celebrating the Eucharist - which, however, many at the beginning of this doctrinal dispute seemed to think we felt - since, just as the sun itself (which is an eminent part of the created world and as it were a member of the living body) is said to be present even corporally to the other parts of the world and is truly and effectively present even to the earth, the lowest of all, so also the Lord Jesus, true God and true man, full of all power and efficacy, in whom the treasure of the knowledge and wisdom of God and all graces resides, by the natural communication of his flesh is closely joined to his church in the rite of the sacred supper and in that visible testimony of the symbols, is said and believed to be truly, substantially, and even corporally present and to be received in the manner in which he presented himself by the faithful. Although he is not understood to be present at the supper in such a way that his bodily condition can be touched or perceived by any sense, nor even apprehended by reason or the judgment of the flesh in this way, but is understood and apprehended as present by faith alone of those who are instructed by the word of the Lord. For Christ is a glorious person united in immortal and eternal substance with the unbreakable truth of two natures, whom those who truly receive do not take otherwise than as he is, and those who truly eat of his flesh and truly drink of his blood cannot eat and drink the Lord otherwise than substantially and essentially. The very nature of faith and the mystery, which relies on truth, teaches all this to the one who contemplates, which nevertheless so abhors the carnal sense and crude eating and drinking that it admits only the spiritual manner of that heavenly food and drink. For there is no true eating except of the body in the church, nor any other blood that is drunk except the true blood of him who nourishes and feeds the church with himself. We indeed truly eat bread and truly drink wine, but not with the purpose of valuing the evidence of the signs as much as we regard and receive the truth of the things. For the sake of these, we receive the consecrated symbols through the word and sanctified by the Lord in external and visible use and rite in the assembly.</p>
      <p>This is what I had to say, etc.</p>
