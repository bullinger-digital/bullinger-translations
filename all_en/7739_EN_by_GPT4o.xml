      <p>Greetings. The writings I recently promised to send to you, most esteemed sir, I only received one of them after the departure of the grain merchants, which is why I am sending it now; I am sending it so that you may see how many lies the adversaries spread and how they depict in their writings, triumphing before victory is achieved, whatever they wish to happen. The invention and style reflect the interpreter, although he himself denies it and pretends to give no credence to such a glorious writing; yet it emerged from the chambers of the French fortress. Yesterday, the consul invited us to a banquet, and among others, he had also summoned the envoy. When we had taken our seats, he slyly addressed me, saying: "My dear Tobias, I am very surprised that nothing has been brought to us from France for so long; it has now been 14 days since I received neither a word from France nor from Solothurn. I wonder what is happening." I added nothing beyond confirming my surprise; but I believe nothing has been brought that would please them. Otherwise, he opposes everything that seems less favorable to him; thus he questions everything, as immediately, if any truth is brought forth, contradictions are devised and opposed. However, the truth itself will eventually break through, so that, even if they wish to the utmost, they cannot attack it. From Zug and Schwyz, it is reported that the Lutherans have won and that among others, several Swiss leaders of the royalists have fallen.</p>
      <p>What is true, time will tell.</p>
      <p>This very quickly. 1569, January 4th, in Chur.</p>
      <p>All of ours, especially the consul and Mr. Karl, send their regards to your kindness.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Tobias Egli. I eagerly await the letters of testimony that the homeland once gave.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most renowned Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his eternally esteemed sir.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Ann, pastor at the Grossmünster in Zürich.</p>
