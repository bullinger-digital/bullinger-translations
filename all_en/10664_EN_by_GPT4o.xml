      <p>May the grace of God increase in you in the perfect wisdom of Christ in the power of the Holy Spirit, beloved friend and brother.</p>
      <p>Know that Felix Leemann is withholding from me a debt of borrowed money, which he has used for two years, along with my wife's paternal inheritance, more than one hundred and fifty pounds, despite all his promises. When I amicably demand it, he refuses to give me anything, and you know that I cannot obtain justice. Therefore, I wrote to the mayor and council for safe conduct; and the safe conduct, which is given to the Jews, has been denied to me. In this matter, I am greatly burdened and brought to considerable harm, as I have traveled one hundred and twenty miles from home to pursue the debt. And now the matter must be handled with great delay, cost, and danger, which is my great ruin, and I do not know how to expect it. Therefore, I am now writing to the great council for judgment and justice and request that what belongs to me by divine right be granted. I ask you as a friend and brother, for God's sake, to advise and help me to divine and natural justice, by whatever means you can, and to take pity on my distress, so that God will reward you, and I will also serve you faithfully. May God protect you from evil. Amen.</p>
      <p>Greet Master LÃ¶wen for me from old acquaintance. Tell him that when we want to inquire about what we have achieved with the cross of Christ, and what we have learned in the school of tribulation of the time, also from other countries, matters, sects, and new news, I would be pleased to talk with you, if there were time.</p>
      <p>Take a token, so that you do not forget me in love.</p>
      <p>Given in haste, on Wednesday, in exile, the fourth of August in the year of our Lord 1535.</p>
      <p>Wilhelm Reublin, a poor friend of God, your willing servant.</p>
      <p>To the Christian and evangelical preacher Master Heinrich N., chancellor at the great minster in Zurich, my dear friend.</p>
