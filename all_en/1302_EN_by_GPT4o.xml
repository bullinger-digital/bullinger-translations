      <p>Year 1551, on the 31st of May, in London.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Most esteemed Mr. Bullinger, I wrote to you from the Frankfurt fair. I sent Mr. Peter Martyr the first sheet of his commentaries; he likes the format and the lettering, but would prefer a larger format; please remind Mr. Froschauer to expedite the edition; it is eagerly awaited by everyone. Your fifth Decade is being seized by all the pious. I wish Froschauer would undertake to print your book "On the Origin of Error"; it is awaited by many, not only here in England, but also with desire among us and in Friesland. I have taken care of your letters through certain and faithful friends. I delivered your letters and book to our prince, who had been eagerly expecting it; he said: "If only I had the means to reciprocate;" but I wish for you not gifts, but steadfastness through Christ, which is now growing daily in the prince. I have decided, God willing, to visit Mr. Hooper in his diocese together with Mr. Valérand Poullain; for he has in his hands a part of the Bible, which he has undertaken to correct. If I could obtain from the royal majesty through Mr. Hooper and Mr. Canterbury the privilege of printing, I would repair the loss suffered in the printed Bibles; I have not yet sold 50 copies. To obtain this, I would wish for your commendatory letters to Mr. Canterbury and Mr. Hooper or, if you see fit, to the king himself. You would not believe with what spirit he receives letters and learned Germans; without a doubt, with your letters, it would be granted to me. The Bible of Sebastian Castellio is being bought here by many everywhere; but yours is read much more diligently and is desired to be issued in two translations. Froschauer should be encouraged for this edition, even if it means setting aside others submitted to the press. Mr. a Lasco and Utenhove and Mr. Valérand Poullain, a diligent promoter of refugees, send their greetings to your lordship and all the pious. Please greet on my behalf Mr. Gwalther, Gesner, Pellican, and those you know to be my friends. May the greatest and best keep you safe with us for a long time to the glory of His name.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johann Birckmann, bookseller from Cologne.</p>
      <p>Please, my dear Mr. Bullinger, prepare a response and send letters to Strasbourg to the fair at the house of Wendelin Rihel; if I can timely conclude my business here, I will be there, God willing.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, revered lord. In Zürich.</p>
