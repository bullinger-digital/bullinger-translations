      <p>Greetings and perpetual, immortal thanks to you, ever most esteemed man, for the great kindnesses shown to me. Our Frisius has most amply praised your most generous favors. If only we could one day reciprocate! I believe Stumpf has already been with you. I have no news about the Emperor, except for what a credible man, whom you know, noted on the sheet. You will return the sheet. Luther has published a remarkably vehement book against the papists. I have never read anything more severe, I would also say more imprudent. It consists of 26 pages. Those you recommended to me, Widenhuber and Gügi, I have received to the best of my ability, but with the most willing spirit. They will be a living letter. Lavater has been sent as an envoy to Baden; Haab has succeeded in the mayoralty; Röist, son of the late Röist, a young man of good hope, has been admitted to the council. Farewell. Zurich, 14 June 1545. Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Joachim Vadian, his most esteemed lord and patron.</p>
