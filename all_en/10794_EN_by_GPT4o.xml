    <p xml:id="regest1">Writes in German for the sake of clarity. Both the canons and the city of Konstanz claim the annual ground rent of 12 guilders on a grain tithe in Kloten; the Zurich council has now demanded securities for Hans Konrad Escher, who has to pay the interest, in case of a payment to the city of Konstanz, which are not customary. Bullinger is to find out whether a lawsuit against the cathedral chapter would be worthwhile, even if the original documents could not be produced years ago when [Jakob] Grebel inquired about them. Requests discreet inquiries with trusted persons. The messenger will return to Konstanz.</p>

      <p>S. I will write in German, so that the lack of vocabulary does not obscure the matter.</p>
      <p>It begins, dear, kind Mr. Bullinger, a dispute over several guilders, where the canons of Konstanz are one party and my lords as administrators of the fabric (or) church construction here in the cathedral are the other party. The annual rent is twelve gold guilders, belonging to the mentioned fabric, which is based on a grain tithe in Kloten near Zurich, and the tenant Hans Konrad Escher pays the majority and some others in Klingnau near Zurzach also contribute to the mentioned 12 guilders. After the expulsion of our clergy, both parties have collected this rent, namely after the Capler war, the city of Konstanz, but before and since the last war, those on the other side of the lake have collected it; however, the last two rents were outstanding, which we have amicably demanded from Escher. He has relied on the honorable council of Zurich, who have written to my lords, a council here, that Escher offers to pay, but that my lords should provide assurance that if he is sought by others, he will not suffer harm, and that we should represent him in such harm. They have also informed us that the canons intend to collect such rent, therefore we should let them know our response. However, it is not customary to give such a letter of indemnity, as it might endanger us and bring us into dispute. But one cannot refuse a regular receipt, otherwise there is concern that Escher and his associates would not remain unmolested by the canons.</p>
      <p>I have brought this matter to you in good confidence with the request, if you could do this with common sense, to inform me: So that my lords would be advised to seek their rights on the basis of the pledge and to justly demand the outstanding rents on behalf of the fabric, which rightly should remain in the city as funds designated for church construction, if it were against the claim of the supposed rights that the canons have and would undoubtedly present in court, they might maintain it. For if it were decided against us, as we do not expect, it would have been better not to have started. There are no original documents available; as it is an old monastic matter, and Grebel, who previously paid the rent, applied years ago to have a letter heard as to why he paid the rent. However, there was no original document available.</p>
      <p>I write all this for the sake of information, and although a future judgment is not easy to learn, you might nevertheless find some advice from well-trusted persons. Therefore, my request to you is that you do not burden yourself with this and make discreet inquiries and then kindly write to me about it. Understand in the best way that I trouble you with this, it happens out of good trust, and because I have no better way. Otherwise, I would not want to hinder your much greater and more important affairs with it. I am eager to serve you.</p>
      <p>Given in Konstanz in haste - this messenger will return here - March 3, 1536.</p>
      <p>Thomas Blarer, your good friend.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my kind lord and dear friend. Zurich.</p>
