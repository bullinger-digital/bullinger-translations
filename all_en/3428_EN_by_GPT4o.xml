      <p>Most illustrious man and to me to be revered as a father, the conversation was so abruptly ended that the matter has been deferred to the next assembly, in which a better form will be prescribed; everyone has already departed. I have scarcely been able to manage with the Württembergers up to this point; when my health permits, which I also hope will be before Christmas, I will come to you. If only Melanchthon had received your letters; oh, how many benefits would have followed for the Christian republic. But more on these matters in person, God willing.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, may you all fare much better and pray to God for me, as I am afflicted with a severe cough and forced to rest due to a cold.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, December 8, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your obedient son, Lelio Sozzini.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and in every virtue most excellent lord Heinrich Bullinger, to be revered as a father. Zürich.</p>
