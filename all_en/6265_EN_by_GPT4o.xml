      <p>My friendly greeting and very willing service always precede you, well-learned, pious, noble, and wise Mr. Bullinger. Your letter, sent to me on August 30th, I received today along with the mentioned booklet from the messenger, and I hereby thank you in the most friendly manner possible for the honor and kindness you have once again shown me, as you have often done before. May Almighty God reward you, and if I can be of service to you, you will find me entirely willing and inclined. I will also make my entire household partakers of this booklet and hereby await the moment (known only to God) with hope for a joyful resurrection on the last day in Christ, our redeemer and savior, etc. We have no new news with us, except that the plague, which you also mentioned, is spreading rapidly everywhere, in France and other places, although it is still good with us. However, the Lord, whom we have offended with our sins no less than others, will not remain absent as a just judge; may He be gracious and merciful to us. I cannot, at this time, show myself to you as I should, but it will happen shortly with God's help. May He keep you in long-lasting health with His grace.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>Dated in Bern on the 5th of September in the year 64. Your willing servant, Beat Ludwig von MÃ¼linen.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, noble, and wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, leader in the word of God of the city of Zurich, my most honorable lord, to his hands, etc.</p>
