      <p>Greetings. This brief note of mine, most excellent man, will be excused by necessity.</p>
      <p>A cruel plague afflicts us, which daily takes away many good people here in Norden, and my wife is dangerously ill. Emden is now free from the plague.</p>
      <p>Dithmarschen was conquered by arms in the month of June and surrendered to the Duke of Holstein. Our Prince Edzard set out for Sweden about a month ago to bring back a bride, the eldest daughter of the king. What good I might predict for our church from this marriage, I do not know; but Christ the Lord, the head of all principality and power, will easily bring to nothing all the plans of the adversaries. May the Lord our God, the Lord our God, add many more years to you, in which you may still live usefully for the church of God. In our name, you will deign to greet our esteemed teachers, Dr. Peter Martyr and Dr. Gesner the physician. All your colleagues and brothers greet you, wishing you all happiness in the Lord. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In haste.</p>
      <p>Norden, August 14, 1559.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, Martin Micronius.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant doctor of the church of Zürich, his lord and brother. In Zürich.</p>
