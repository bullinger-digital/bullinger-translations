      <p>God be with us, dearly beloved son. As I inquired, godfather Hans Gossauer tells me that Susanna and the children have come out poorly; yet I am glad that they are fresh and healthy. Regarding the pig, cheerful Susanna has told you our opinion, that you should send it now and on Friday, November 21st, so that we can butcher it the following Saturday, November 22nd. Have it inspected by you beforehand, etc. And since you have two, one fat and one less fat and smaller, keep the fatter one, send me the smaller one, which I prefer. And whatever it is worth, I will satisfy you; for I do not desire it for free; you need not do this either. If you can send something for my hospitality, which I intend to hold for the butchering, send it to me, but only for the money. If you cannot send anything, it does not matter, etc. I am content with your good willingness.</p>
      <p>There is no news, except that a Swiss diet is scheduled for December 7th in Baden. In Tours, France, as I am informed by Bern, the king has dealt with the poor believers as in Lyon; many have been killed. He is said to have issued a new decree, in which he does not mention the conspiracy of Admiral, but he had a considerable reputation, especially among the nobility, which weakened the king's majesty; he did not want to have such a person beside him. But if so, why did he have boys, girls, young people, and many thousands of the faithful killed? But God sees this and will demand an account.</p>
      <p>All our people greet you, Susanna, Elisabeth, and Margaret. Also greet J. Hansen and H. LÃ¶wen for me and send me back the conditions of the tasks of Count Ludwig, which I sent you with your Heinrich. I doubt whether I lent you the oration concerning the seven places held in the council at Trent; if you have it, send it to me. God be with you and all of us.</p>
      <p>Sunday, Othmar's Day, 1572.</p>
      <p>Bullinger the Elder.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor at Berg.</p>
