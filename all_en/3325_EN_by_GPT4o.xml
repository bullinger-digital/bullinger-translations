      <p>Greetings. Reverend man and dearest brother, today I received your gift, the Apocalypse, in the city of Worms and immediately sent letters to the most excellent man, Mr. Oporinus. I only glanced at the section about Gog and Magog, intending to later consider how you adapt the sequence of the entire book to the times and the various struggles of the church, which are certainly foretold in that work. Here we endure twofold struggles, for some are demanding that decrees be written against those who reject bread-worship. Many delegates have opposed this. May God be present with His church.</p>
      <p>I could not write more.</p>
      <p>I wish greetings to Mr. Peter Martyr, Mr. Gesner, Mr. Bibliander, and all of you.</p>
      <p>I would like you to write to me about your son.</p>
      <p>Farewell, on the 20th of September.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend man, outstanding in learning and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
