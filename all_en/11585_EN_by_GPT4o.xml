    <p xml:id="regest1">Is as distraught as never before over Vadian's communications [No. 1541]; if Ferdinand's [I.] army retreats, Vienna will soon fall as well. God have mercy on us! Woe to the princes struck with blindness who stand in the way of true Reformation! It seems as if we must suffer the fate of Zedekiah. Has nothing new to report from the [Regensburg] Diet, except that [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse departed [on June 14], not to the joy of Emperor [Charles V.]. The arsonist H[einrich] of Brunswick is not punished by the Emperor, who acts without commitment in religious matters. What the Emperor will do after the defeat [before Buda] remains to be seen: even Saul did nothing until he was forced by the Philistines. The five articles of agreement [by Elector Joachim II of Brandenburg?] are rejected by both sides, and Bullinger also judges them negatively. Received a letter a few days ago from the W端rttemberg chancellor Nikolaus M端ller [known as Maier] [No. 1537], in which he asked for a recommendation to Vadian, with whom he would like to get in touch. Vadian should not deny his attention to this excellent man. Will soon receive a messenger [Rudolf Gwalther] from Regensburg and forward the news to Vadian, as Vadian should continue to inform Bullinger. The reports he received about the Prague fire match the news transmitted by Vadian. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. What shall I write, my dear Vadian? For I was so stunned by your letters and overwhelmed with grief as never before in my life. If Ferdinand's army has indeed retreated, we will soon hear that Vienna, the most noble metropolis of Austria, has been occupied. May the Lord have mercy on us and spare us for the glory of His name, and not deliver the soul of His turtledove into the jaws of that bloody dragon. Woe, woe to those blind princes of the most afflicted people, whose fault it is that no sincere reformation can be obtained! But without reformation, it is so far from being able to resist the Turks that it is more credible that we are going the way of Zedekiah, the foolish, impious, and idolatrous. - I have received nothing worthy of note from the Diet, except that Hesse has returned, leaving the Emperor not without impatience. He does not punish the leader and head of the arsonists, Heinrich of Brunswick. He acts very coldly in matters of religion. What he will do after the defeat remains to be seen. That Saul will do nothing unless forced by the hand of the Philistines. A certain formula of concord has been composed, but it has been rejected by our side and disapproved by the adversaries. There are 5 articles. I could not describe them, they are so insipid. They seem to have been concocted by a man who, by his curiosity, will undoubtedly ensure that he is deserted by friends and despised by enemies. But more on these matters another time. - A few days ago, the chancellor of the most illustrious Duke of W端rttemberg, Nikolaus M端ller, wrote me a very friendly letter, and made honorable mention of you, especially, beseeching that I greet you and, wherever I could, obtain letters to him, so that he might have the opportunity to establish a friendship with you. I therefore pray that you do not overlook this most worthy and illustrious man. - I will soon have news from Regensburg; whatever it brings, I will share with you. In the meantime, do not cease to communicate everything you receive to me; for you do a most welcome service. - I have received the same news about the Prague castle as you, not a single letter differing. Farewell, dearest and much esteemed Vadian. July 2, 1541. Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Joachim Vadian, the most prudent consul of St. Gallen, his ever-honored lord.</p>
