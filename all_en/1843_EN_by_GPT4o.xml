      <p>Greetings. The reason we have not written to you for a long time is that Father Comander has been very busy with frequent preaching; for I have been quite seriously afflicted with fever and pleurisy for almost three weeks, hence all those labors fell to him. But we also know that you have had many things to attend to during this time. Now, by the grace of God, I have recovered, and although I am not yet strong, I can preach and sufficiently perform my duties.</p>
      <p>Thanks be to God, who has blessed me with my children; may I be useful to others as well! There is absolutely no news here, so much so that we are amazed that everything is so quiet and peaceful, except for this, which we have heard repeatedly: the princes of Germany, as well as Ferdinand, the Roman king, and the Duke of Bavaria, have gathered to unanimously request from Emperor Charles that a council be held in Germany, excluding the Italians and Spanish priests, that all Spanish and foreign soldiers be removed from Germany, and that the Swabian League be restored. We have not yet heard what he has replied. Some say he has allowed them everything at their discretion, and that he himself is returning to Spain; there are also those who affirm that he has finally passed away.</p>
      <p>My merchants from Engadin, returning from Italy, say they saw a certain satirical painting in Milan, in which Ferdinand, the Roman king, is riding a lean and scraggly horse, resembling a beggar; the emperor is being carried by a backward-moving crab; the king of France is proudly riding a fierce horse without a bridle; the Venetians are standing with ears pricked, waiting for the end: the Turk is watching all of them, bursting with laughter. I wanted to write this so you cannot complain that I write nothing. But take this: a few days ago, a certain brother preacher of yours, Joachim Gachlinger, came to us; we sent him with a simple mind to a certain church for the sake of testing, to see what he was like and how he conducted himself. The church is pleased with him; however, the matter has become suspect to us solely because he has never written to us, as we had instructed and he had promised, nor has he come to us, even when he was here in town. Therefore, for your faithfulness and care, which you have for the churches of Christ and for us, write to us about what kind of man he is and how honestly he has conducted himself with you. We will send our decisions in eight days, when we have more certain news. Father Comander, Heimius, who has now fully recovered, and others whom you know, send you many greetings. Farewell in the Lord Jesus, most esteemed man, and do not cease to love us in return. Given in Chur, on the tenth day of April in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours in integrity, Philipp Gallicius. To the truly great man, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
