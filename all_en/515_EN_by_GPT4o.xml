      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, the faithful pastor and most esteemed colleague of the church in Geneva. In Geneva.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Today I received your letters, most esteemed and dearest Calvin, from which I learned of the passing of your dear wife to the Lord. I indeed grieve that you have been deprived of her companionship, help, and consolation. Yet I rejoice that she, freed from the great troubles of this life, now rejoices with Christ in whom she believed. Meanwhile, I pray to the Lord to comfort you and to alleviate your griefs, which are neither unjust nor blameworthy. You know that He lives who watches over us. You are not unaware that you are in His care and help. Finally, you know that she is not lost but sent ahead. For shortly, all of us who trust in Christ will be freed from these our troubles and will triumph with the victorious Christ, who loved us and gave Himself for us. To whom be glory.</p>
      <p>And thus far indeed we have understood each other better through writings than through words proposed in person. And thus far indeed the writings have turned out excellently. Therefore, there is no reason for you to abandon your church in these troubles and come to me, incurring great expenses and tiring yourself with the inconvenience of travel. Continue, as you have begun, to write what you wish. If I desire anything, I will indicate it in your writings. In turn, clearly and candidly point out what displeases you in mine.</p>
      <p>I will not discuss the French alliance more extensively, nor will I respond to your arguments, but I will outline in a few words what has happened among our people these days: from which you will understand that there is no hope left among our people that they will ever join in alliance with the Emperor, or with the French, or with any prince. After the discussion of the French alliance began at the Diet in Solothurn, the articles of the alliance were sent, both by the royal envoys and by the Swiss, to our most honorable council. This council, having convened the greater council, which consists of 200 men, thoroughly explained the whole matter, namely what the king demands, what he promises, what is done by the Swiss. There was a long and careful discussion about the dangers of the alliance, as well as the benefits that seem to be hoped for from it. Finally, it was unanimously decided that this whole matter should be referred to the people, and the votes or opinions of all and each should be collected. Delegates were chosen, most distinguished men, to whom this function was assigned, to report the proposals in the countryside, that is, in the cities, counties, prefectures, and territories of the Zurichers, and to faithfully present them to all.</p>
      <p>They immediately carried this out. And first indeed the votes and opinions were collected in the city through each tribe individually. Afterwards, having left the city, they asked for the opinions of all the subjects throughout the countryside of the Zurichers. This lasted for eight continuous days. The delegates were divided into four almost equal parts of the territory, so that two performed the duty of the delegation in one part. They returned the day before and report unanimously that never in the memory of men living today have such concordant assemblies been found as in this case.</p>
      <p>They all demand with one voice, which in such a large crowd and diversity of people is astonishing to say but true, that the magistrates defend the freedom granted by God, do not join in alliance and bond with foreign kings or princes, yet meanwhile keep intact the agreements formerly made with the French, Burgundians, and Austrians, but do not enter into any new alliances. The disasters suffered in those years when the Swiss were bound to King Francis of the French were recited. But I could not encompass in many pages what the best, wisest, and most religious people have put forward against such alliances of princes, gifts, and stipends, and especially against this French alliance, in which everything is done for the king, little or nothing for us. Therefore, all have so firmly resolved in God their minds with such constancy that I do not doubt the Zurichers will not accept the articles of the alliance, even if all other Swiss do. But even in other cities and districts, the best people abhor that alliance. Our ancestors, from the year 1522, often requested and asked, never wanted to consent to the French alliance, which still lasts today and was begun with King Francis.</p>
      <p>All have felt from that constancy a splendid benefit, therefore they also abhor the new one. Nor do I doubt that we would have lost the gospel and all true religion and discipline within a few years if we had reopened the door to royal military service through such alliances. Seeing therefore that marvelous concord of the whole people, I give thanks to God and hope for the best from God's mercy. But if Pharaoh Epiphanes Antiochus has joined (although there are those who suspect that they have long since beautifully coalesced with the mediator Cardinal de Guise and the author Constable) and we have pleased the Lord, and He wishes to save us, He will raise up Maccabees and some true Israelites, by whose work the ferocity of those will be broken and the people of God will be freed. But if it seems good to the Lord to visit our iniquities with a rod, come, let the will of God be done: may He give us patience and constancy in true faith. Certainly, as our people abhor the French alliance, so they do not love the Emperor, trust nothing in him, hope in Him who alone liberates, and will oppose the Emperor fearlessly if he intends to wage war against us contrary to law and right. May the Lord give us wisdom and strength.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my beloved and honorable Calvin. May Mr. Gallasius and the other colleagues be well. Mr. Bibliander, Pellicanus, Gualtherus, Werdmullerus, Gessnerus, Wolphius, Zwinglius, Ammianus, Collinus, and the others greet you all.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 11th of May, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
