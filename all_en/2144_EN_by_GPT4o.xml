      <p>"You are not your own," says the apostle, and indeed it is so, although I now take those words in another sense, namely, that we are accustomed to think: I will do this and that, and meanwhile we are compelled to do something else. For I had written to you that I would go to Augsburg the day after that day, and indeed everything was prepared; but behold, during the night gout attacked me again, so that I could not move from my bed. Such is the case; but I have recovered again. This is a struggle; sometimes I win, sometimes I am defeated, and again I prepare myself for that journey.</p>
      <p>However, tomorrow I must first go to Stuttgart; I have decided that, before I go to Augsburg, I would like to send a personal messenger to you. You might say the affairs of princes are like the sky, which you now see in one color and shortly after in another. I wrote that there would be no future assemblies; but the appearance or will of the princes has changed; now I think there will be.</p>
      <p>The matter of the Margrave of Brandenburg is to be settled, as many hope. The rest, when I send the messenger. You would do me a great favor if you wrote to those two, whom you know, that I have written about the future assemblies and will shortly send a messenger to you and that gout has detained me, so I could not go where I had intended.</p>
      <p>Since I know you love Martyr so much, I, who have never seen the man (certainly for your sake, Heinrich Bullinger), invited him to stay with me for two months and as much longer as he wishes. He accepted the condition, he will come, and I will ensure that he can have a place in this school, although something stands in the way, as I think you foresee. But I will try. For what is safe at night?</p>
      <p>I wrote a booklet in Latin on a great and serious matter, namely how we might respond if it is a question of restoring the council; I know it pleases the prince and his people.</p>
      <p>I await your Justification and not just one copy, but for the prince and other brothers.</p>
      <p>I write at night; the messenger will take these to Lindau; I wish you would resolve them. Send your letters to Gartarolus; they are indeed of some importance. Farewell and greetings to your whole family, school, and church. May the Lord Jesus bless all your labors. Amen. I beseech you, commend me to the Lord in your prayers. Nothing is more closely connected than Brenz and Vergerius, and certainly with wonderful affection (I can testify this to the whole world) he embraces my affairs. When I see love, I see divinity or a sign of divinity; thus Christ teaches. What could make me happier than having Martyr as a guest? However, I hope to have him within 20 days.</p>
      <p>I send his letters to you. Melanchthon is now sharpening his pen against Schwenckfeld. The rest (as I said), when I send the messenger.</p>
      <p>TÃ¼bingen, on the first day of January 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, etc.</p>
