    <p xml:id="regest1">God has given peace. The Reformed in Montbéliard are indeed now delivered to the French. Bucer hopes for good things for the spread of the Gospel in the Duchy of Württemberg. The people of Zurich are acting reprehensibly towards the people of Schaffhausen if they recall Beat Gering. Erasmus Ritter cannot be left alone in Schaffhausen. Bullinger is well aware of the intrigues of the opponent Benedikt Burgauer. If it cannot be otherwise, he should ensure that the successor is of equal standing. Jud should not take offense at Bucer's reference to the usage of words by the Church Fathers. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, esteemed Bullinger.</p>
      <p>As you see, the Lord has given us peace beyond the hope of many, and our (the Reformed) are no more subject to the French than they are now to Montbéliard. I indeed pity these people. But they did not want to accept the Gospel, even when it was offered to them voluntarily. They also desired it in the Duchy, and I hope that things will go well there, as much as is usually granted to us in this age. This Frenchman, about whom you write, has made vain boasts about the Duke. However, some conditions are reported to be quite harsh for the flesh, because I do not know by what means the king has made the principality subject to him.</p>
      <p>You people of Zurich have gravely sinned against the people of Schaffhausen, who recall Beat (Gering) from them, and he gravely sins, who allows himself to be recalled. For Erasmus (Ritter) alone is not enough there, and you know the nature of the antagonist (Benedikt Burgauer). Even if you or Leo were alone in Zurich, the ministry would still be much firmer than if Erasmus and Beat were in Schaffhausen. I beg you by Christ, make sure this plan is changed, or if it is absolutely necessary to do so, that you give Erasmus another colleague, and not just anyone, but someone serious, sincere, candid, and learned. These are indeed needed in this republic.</p>
      <p>Commend me to the best and most pious Leo (Jud), whom I pray will not be offended that I have tried to show that the fathers used certain words with good sense. I neither want to use them nor teach others to use them. Simplicity is most pleasing to me, especially in this present thorny age. I aim for this one thing, that we do not seem to disagree with those ancient saints, where they themselves have felt piously.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently. I hope your Antronians (people of Andernach) will now behave more modestly. Commend me to the holy man Pelican (Conrad Pellican) and say that his relative has not been with me, otherwise, I would have provided him with whatever I could for his benefit. Greet in my words Mr. Bibliander (Theodor Bibliander), Collin (Rudolf Collin), Fabricius (Wolfgang Fabricius Capito), and the others.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, July 11, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your Martin Bucer from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most pious, learned, and vigilant bishop of the people of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, dearest brother.</p>
