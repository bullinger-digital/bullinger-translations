    <p xml:id="regest1">Due to being overwhelmed, he encloses a copy of his letter addressed to Bucer. King Ferdinand I is not to be feared, but even more so the temptation of French gold. Bullinger fears that great power ambitions will be achieved through the spilling of Swiss blood. Envy and the luxury arising from war booty will ruin the country if a more modest way of life is not returned to. He hopes to have answered Myconius' questions with the letter to Bucer as well.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Due to urgent matters, I have transcribed the letter written to Bucer so that I might both have a copy and satisfy your question. Therefore, read it. I send this copy so that you may return it at some point. I wish you to be very well in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I think we have nothing to fear from Ferdinand. It is more to be feared that we might be overcome by our own luxury and eventually be subdued by French gold. For as our people feast throughout all of Switzerland against all sumptuary laws and are partly stripped of all substance by fines, partly by intemperance, who, I ask, will finally pay the bill if not the Frenchman? For I fear that he, coveting foreign kingdoms, is thinking of acquiring them for himself with our blood. I wish I were a false prophet! Certainly, many of our people are not admonished by laws, fines, or any correction - although I would wish for this to be more severe - nor by the sharp word of truth, to live more frugally. I seem to see all of Switzerland not only consumed by envy but also by fatal luxury, I say, soon to be consumed. I wish the spoils imported from elsewhere had oppressed only those who imported them.</p>
      <p>But such are the judgments of the Lord. Yet we are not immune either. Even today, the triumphs of our ancestors please us.</p>
      <p>Moreover, while I was writing to Bucer, I was guiding my pen as if I had already written to you, because I was thinking of responding to both with a single letter. This is the copy of it: «I do not know what [...] admonishing etc.»</p>
      <p>These are the things, Myconius, venerable brother, that we wrote to Bucer, with which we believe we have also satisfied you. Indicate what you have received from Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>I wish safety for Carolostadius, Bersius, Thomas, and the others, especially W[olfgang] Wissenburg.</p>
      <p>October 28, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
