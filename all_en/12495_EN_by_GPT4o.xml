    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger likely received Medmann's letter [No. 2419] through the printers returning to [Zurich] from the Frankfurt Fair.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Since someone is now being sent from Bonn to Zurich, Medmann takes the opportunity to fulfill the request expressed in Bullinger's letter [not received] and the promise given in his penultimate letter [not received]. Bullinger can respond with the same messenger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- While reading the [“Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae] confession,” Medmann noticed that the people of Zurich hardly know [Johannes] Campanus, which is peculiar since he became known for his heresies. When Medmann was still young, Campanus opposed the local "sophists" at a public disputation in Cologne with some pious theses that likely still circulate in Cologne today. However, since then, he has become a staunch defender of the papacy. His written defense of purgatory was welcomed by the Cologne "theologasters." As soon as Medmann has a copy of it, he will send it to Bullinger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- [P.S.:] Bullinger will receive further information about Campanus with Medmann's dispatch of Campanus’ writing.</p>

      <p>Greetings. During the time of the Frankfurt Fair, I wrote to you, my dear Bullinger, and I believe that my letter was delivered to you by your printers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>And although at this time I have nothing particularly worthy of writing, yet, since a citizen here was preparing to travel there, I thought I should write to you, to respond both to your request and to my promise in my penultimate letter. Through him, you will be able to reply safely, if only your affairs grant you enough time.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>In your Confession, I read about Campanus, whom you write is entirely unknown to you, which indeed seemed strange to me; for even from public rumors, something of that error should have reached you. I remember the time when, as a young man, he presented himself in Cologne for a public disputation against my Cologne sophists and sent some pious propositions, which, as I think, could still be found among good men in Cologne. Now, however, as much as he can, he would gladly raise the papacy and is entirely focused on establishing purgatory, about which he wrote a certain volume that has been approved by my highest friends, the theologasters of Cologne. I will send it shortly, and when I can certainly have it for you, as an example. Now both the brevity of time and my occupations prevent me from writing more.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell in the Lord and forgive my notes.</p>
      <p>18th of May, 1546. Bonn.</p>
      <p>Your Petrus Medmann. When I send the assertion of purgatory, I will also write more extensively about Campanus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, most diligent professor of sacred letters in the church of Zurich, etc., all greetings. Zurich.</p>
