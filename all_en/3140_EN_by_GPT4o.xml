      <p>Greetings. Believe me, your journey to us will be no less beneficial to the church than it will be pleasant to you personally. For in rejecting it under the pretext of poor health, I think you are greatly mistaken. You will find nothing more suitable for strengthening your health.</p>
      <p>You will also either partly dispel or alleviate the sorrow contracted from the death of your relative, Lavater. The main thing is that we also discuss the German dialogues. I confess that the majority is more fascinated by that gross error, which we would like to remedy, than to show any hope of healing. However, there are still some with a more gentle nature among whom our effort might perhaps achieve something. Among them, one Martin Schalling, a minister of the Regensburg church, wrote to me, not hiding what he feels, wishing to maintain fraternal union. You know how his colleague Gallus rages. Yet he calls me a teacher and excuses the difference in opinion with as much moderation as he can. Such people are certainly to be encouraged, or at least not aggravated. Therefore, my response was calm, in which I nevertheless freely criticize his confession.</p>
      <p>However, because there is very little hope from the crowd itself, I have never wished for a convention as you imagine it to be. Indeed, I will always strive by whatever means I can to avoid being called. But if it happens, we must see that refusal does not bring us disgrace and reproach.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I do not fear a convention of the multitude. If Philipp wants to meet with a few, nothing is more desirable, because he will not summon Brentius and the like, but those whom he thinks can be reconciled to us so that he may subscribe to us with less envy. Just as I approve of this plan of his, so I think it should be supported as far as possible. But I would like you to be convinced of this alone at present, not to change your plan about coming to us. I earnestly ask Peter Martyr and Gualther to urge you. You will kindly greet them and the other fellow ministers in my name, along with your family. May the Lord keep you safe and guide you with His spirit.</p>
      <p>Geneva, March 30, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, brother and honorable fellow minister.</p>
