      <p>Greetings. Four days ago, the preacher from St. Gallen, Fortmiller, was here with me. He lamented the disgraceful fall of his people so much that he brought me to tears, especially because he firmly asserted that our Vadianus was the main author of this evil, which I tell you alone. The common people were deceived by a certain cunning, and even a good part of the senate did not understand the matter and now deeply regret that they have unwittingly bitten into the bridle of this miserable and execrable servitude. Then he and other fellow ministers were so struck by the indignity of this matter that they would rather resign their ministry and leave the church to move elsewhere, which I strongly advised against, etc. He earnestly asked me, on behalf of himself and his fellow administrators, to inform you as soon as possible, so that with your immediate counsel, you might indicate what they should do, what should be said to the senate, and what should be taught in the sermon. He would have come to you himself, if it had not been taken in the worst way by the senate that they had once used your counsel in some matter and had come to you. The good, dear man is in such a bad state that I feel deeply sorry for him; for he is naturally more affected by emotions and seized with a more intense zeal. He was carried away in lamentations; he lamented beyond measure. He has a brother, 19 years older than him, not far from Stain; he is also a priest, but of a very pious and irreproachable life.</p>
      <p>He took him at his word; he must go to him, as he is old and weak, as he indeed is, and under this pretense, he thought to come to me and ask me to write to you about how badly and disgracefully his St. Gallers have entered into the alliance with the French with great haste.</p>
      <p>The letters were already made and everything was set up, only the sealing was urged; it was last Sunday eight days ago. The preachers knew nothing about it, except that they suspected the opposite; such a deception was woven for them. The preachers are very determined; Zyle wants to leave; he, Fortmiller, would much rather leave; the schoolmaster Sattler or Kessler, a very pious and capable man, is exceedingly distressed, can assess the matter well, and knows what it all entails; not knowing where to go or what to do.</p>
      <p>I strongly advised that they should not abandon the church for many reasons, since what is done cannot be undone, and they should strive to prevent far worse things from these evils, etc. I have most solemnly promised to inform you of this at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>Take it seriously; for it will be necessary. The preachers are vehement, even after the fact. One of them (I think it is Zyle) preached today, so that the mayor (I think it is Schlumpf) ran out of the church in great anger and slammed the door behind him so hard that it echoed, and there is great unrest in the community, also among some council members.</p>
      <p>And I greatly fear that this immoderation and excessive zeal will do more harm to the Church of Christ than they will liberate the republic from servitude by these means. He confided in me that Vadianus is the main cause, having persuaded some others who were never of this mind to agree. If it is half as Fortmiller claims, whom I still consider pious and honest, even though he is often hot-tempered and too much attacked, then it is a great pity, although the matter itself cries out as a horrendous planned crime. May God have mercy on them!</p>
      <p>Write to the dear men without delay for God's sake; for they are eagerly seeking your advice and comfort. Oh God, oh God, the miserable pity that such a thing was agreed upon for the sake of 400 florins, as he claims; even if it were 40,000, they should still be ashamed to death. Truly, dear God, have mercy on them and on us all. I can no longer, I have roughly learned that these days Gotgab St√ºltzer wants to go to Zurich from Constance tomorrow; his wife is here tonight, and I have so much to do, it's unbelievable. Take care; you will now be informed of the matter as needed.</p>
      <p>Your letters have reached me; I thank you eternally. Take care and be vigilant, as I have no doubt.</p>
      <p>I would have gone to Winterthur; but many things hold me back, and among them also the unfinished house of Hieronymus, into which I must move, as no other suitable accommodations could be rented there for me and mine.</p>
      <p>I can say no more for lack of time. Pray diligently for us and greet the friends, especially your household.</p>
      <p>I have no news; they are waiting for the commander to return to Constance; he is supposed to bring much good news, perhaps even as they call it good. Farewell, dearest of all mortals. July 11, 1549.</p>
      <p>I am so pleased with Calvin's writing that I revere and adore that holy heart beyond measure in Christ Jesus and wish this spirit and the most holy zeal of God to all those whom the Lord has given as elders and pastors to His church. Oh, how far he is from the shameful fear of some of those who so moderate all their judgments and counsels that they have the world favorable to them, even with an angry God.</p>
