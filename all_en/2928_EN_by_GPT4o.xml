      <p>To our Bullinger, partly what I wrote to Musculus.</p>
      <p>Greetings. The couriers who are about to depart to you (most excellent and dearest Musculus) usually announce their departure at a moment's notice and leave immediately, already booted and hatted. Hence, I write to you less frequently. I will make an effort to find other ways to learn of their departures. The Bavarian nobility diligently and consistently seeks the gospel and has achieved so much that necessity and poverty have driven the prince to open a small crack and window to the gospel; for they have been granted communion under both kinds, as well as the freedom to eat meat and the pure preaching of the word, although this article has the condition attached that it is not to be interpreted according to anyone's whim, but according to the orthodox understanding of scripture. I know these things may seem trivial and vain; however, they are such that they will lead to further fruitful progress. One thing that hinders is that, although the harvest is plentiful, there are few workers, and they are not yet admitted unless they have been shaved beforehand. Today, it is affirmed that the Turk is about to invade Austria with a monstrous army into Hungary, and tomorrow it is denied, so that we have nothing certain; however, I am absolutely certain that the Turk is more powerful than our Ferdinand both in strength and strategy, even if he sends no foot soldier or horseman, for he has so many cities, towns, castles, and fortifications in Hungary where he can sustain such a large crowd of very warlike men that our efforts cannot defeat them. Polweiler, in the name of King Maximilian, was supposed to enlist an army of 3,000 foot soldiers, whom he intended to send to Vienna for the defense of Hungary. Through imprudence, perhaps even malice, he stirred up such a commotion by beating the drum everywhere through Alsace, Lake Constance, Tyrol, Swabia, and Bavaria, announcing openly that he would hold a muster of soldiers at Werdea, that now more or less 15,000 foot soldiers occupy the entire valley and both banks of the Danube from Werdea to Lauingen and Höchstädt, plundering and ravaging. Polweiler, not fortified with the sinews of war, has left, and left no one behind to restrain the soldiers' ferocity. Therefore, the wretched farmers, whether they like it or not, are forced to share what should have been their annual sustenance. This rampage has already lasted 14 days and will undoubtedly last much longer. Our people, moved by the indignity of the matter, are enlisting 8 banners through Schertlin to defend the city. Our soldiers will camp outside the walls, in der Rosenau; for they fear, since the king is not solvent, that a certain Catiline, having been shown a little money, might entice the soldiers in the Netherlands, Italy, and France, and, being surrounded by them, might attempt anything. Thus, we fight the Turk while the magistrate defends against the insolence of the subject. We strive to preside over, indeed to harm, the subjects with this Catholic and orthodox faith. The whole neighborhood is very indignant against the king's imprudence and negligence. A diet has been called for the first of June; but I fear that the king's inconsistency will call the princes in vain, whom he previously summoned for the first of March, only to dissuade them from meeting, because perhaps other plans, thoughts, and machinations were then in place. The king is said to have summoned certain theologasters to the diet, among others Julius Pflug and Sigismund, who preaches here at St. Maurice's, who was once in Switzerland, Fulz. The king sent envoys to the pope to mitigate something in religion; for he cannot keep his subjects under the Babylonian yoke any longer; but that pope, anti-Caesarian, has not yet heard the king's envoys, nor do they think he will hear them, much less heed them.</p>
      <p>The pope is said to be planning a remarkable reformation in the morals of the clergy against the decretals. Moreover, many things in the decretals are to be refuted and instituted differently by him, and he is to indicate that first the papal court and then the whole clergy are to be brought into order; otherwise, what has been attempted by his predecessors with great loss of papal authority will be done in vain. But what is achieved by this cunning, he tries to escape the examination of impious doctrines, for the reformation of doctrines is more important to him than that of the life of the clergy, which has a pretense and can deceive the simpler ones for a time, but soon can return to the former mire like a sow. Doctrines cannot be changed without the fall and view of papal deceit and imposture. I see what the sons of darkness pretend, that not the minds, but rather the eyes, are to be consulted.</p>
      <p>So far, I have written to Musculus, which I had my Thomas copy for you to know. It is remarkable how the royal counselors rage against Polweiler, who now, in the name of the king, deal with merchants here for the sake of hunting and scraping together money, because their malice or imprudence has stirred up such a tumult throughout all of Germany, and what seems more dangerous, has filled the whole world with suspicions, since we have otherwise come to the point where no one trusts another from the heart. They perhaps think that the king, even unwillingly, will be forced to take action against him, lest impunity for the crime burden the king with suspicion. The poor on both shores of the Danube are plundered, burdened, and flayed.</p>
      <p>A fine army arrived on the 13th of this month with its captains, feasting and banqueting at Werdea, and due to lack of money, they have not been able to hold a muster of soldiers to this hour; they promise to hold a muster on the 21st of May. The merchants themselves did not want to lend a penny; therefore, our republic will supply the king's lack.</p>
      <p>There are various and inconsistent rumors about the Turk: some affirm he will certainly be present, others think everything is peaceful because of new truces made with him by the king, and since nothing certain is known, I consider it most certain that no less danger threatens the king from the Hungarians forced to defect from the king and the Transylvanians than from the Turks. The king will try to protect the borders of the empire, but he is unequal in strength to inflict force on the enemy.</p>
      <p>Nor do I doubt that among the greatest adversaries of Christ, powerful in birth, power, and administration of affairs, there have been many plans on how to cast out the disciples of Christ from the synagogues; but the subjects of Bavaria and Austria have rendered many things ineffective, and if they have not completely overturned the arts of the impious, they have at least thrown obstacles in their way.</p>
      <p>The electors will meet in Coburg, not all, but those they call secular; the electoral bishops have held a meeting in the territory of the Archbishop of Cologne, and they have taken it badly that Otto Heinrich has abolished the mass and consigned the idols to Vulcan.</p>
      <p>Many arts are devised, so that (...) some trickery was devised for the ruin of the gospel. An Augsburg man went to Munich, perhaps to announce the pope's blessing to the Bavarian for his merits.</p>
      <p>A muster of very valiant soldiers was held here, and we do not yet know what other use they will have, except that our people may protect themselves against their attacks and machinations, who lie in wait for the wealth of others.</p>
      <p>As for Gesner, I have not yet copied my experiments for him, I ask him to take it in good part; for I have scarcely had time for several months now to even have lunch, due to the impetuous crowds of business and machinations. I will give mine and return what I received from him in good faith.</p>
      <p>The Margrave rode peacefully recently from Neuburg to Werdea and then, passing through the crowd of royal soldiers, said: "You priest's servants, do not let your will be long; we will soon strike each other over the mills; when I get a pair of plundered trousers, I will hang them on the pants." He has now descended to the duchy of the Margrave of Baden, and afterwards will go to Heidelberg to the elector.</p>
      <p>He has entrusted his case to certain wise men, who will handle it before selected arbitrators until the king's arrival. Then he himself will also come to Regensburg. I strongly suspect that if the Margrave's affairs had been peaceful, the Germans would have experienced that the truces between the Emperor and the French had given birth to some monster.</p>
      <p>England is in turmoil again, as they write, with greater force against the queen than ever before. King Philip is scraping together money from everywhere, which is said to be reserved for other uses than to satisfy creditors. They think he will soon amass a hundred thousand ducats for a fiertzgs mal, whether he intends to subjugate England with such a great heap of gold or to plot something else, is not yet known. The day before yesterday, he sent a certain wealthy citizen of Augsburg as an envoy to the Bavarian, undoubtedly not in vain.</p>
      <p>They say the envoys of the Five Cantons have returned from Rome laden with gold and golden chains, perhaps also to give birth to new monsters after the elected months of suffering.</p>
      <p>I sent the booklets to Veierthoi long ago by a faithful courier, but I recently gave them to Leto, which you sent to him, and through him to the excellent man Michael, the elector's preacher. Your booklet on the sacramentarian dissension is approved by me in every way. I hear that Illyricus and some others are sharpening their pens against Philip because of free will. I see not only now, but I saw long before that the whole flock of Luther is nothing but a sink of biting (bitterness?) and caviling. Here they say the Bernese and Zurichers are making a muster of their subjects, which I think is very necessary to be taken seriously; for those roaring lions everywhere and always seek how they may tear apart and devour those whom they wish to destroy. Farewell, excellent men. If you wish to write to me, send letters to Doctor Maximilian in Constance; for from there they will easily be brought to me.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, very quickly, on the 21st of May, in the year etc. 56. G[ereon] S[ailer] d[octor].</p>
