      <p>Our dear Lord Jesus Christ, bless and sanctify us in the richness of His grace, so that we have God and the fullness of all sufficiency. Amen. With the offering of my [friendly] and good-willed services and whatever I can do in the Lord Christ, first of all. Revered, well-learned, beloved friends, lords, and brothers, how gladly I would personally attend to your revered matters, which (as you have learned from the several booklets sent herewith) are of no small concern to the Lord Christ and His beloved, and would have arranged and handled all sorts of things with your reverence, I am, however, prevented from fulfilling this intention at this time due to the weakness and incapacity of my body. Therefore, I am sending your reverence the aforementioned booklet through the ordinary messenger of the lords of Zurich, kindly and brotherly requesting that you read and reread it during my presence here and in Baden, with the Lord's grace, not without prayer, humble diligence, and earnestness. Whatever objections, deficiencies, or errors your reverence may find or might have in this matter, please let me know all of them according to Christian propriety and freedom, so that everything may be handled to the praise of the Lord's glory, in accordance with the various gifts, with due modesty, which should be known to all. May the Spirit of Christ grant this. Amen. Regarding the judgment of the body of Christ, along with other meditations of the truly blessed and pious father Valentinus Cratoaldus, if you find it useful, I would gladly have it diligently printed and published; there are still many excellent works of the same father in this age, scarcely worthy, perhaps reserved for posterity. Everything in both bound booklets is in my handwriting, with very few exceptions. Examine and return the bound volumes after three weeks, or one of you, if it seems appropriate, may come to me. You may keep and read the other unbound works at your leisure. If I can arrange it and it pleases Christ, I may perhaps come to your reverence myself, kindly and Christianly requesting that you be unburdened, to consider and reflect on all this with spiritual judgment and in the spirit of grace, with all prejudices removed. For I have read, heard, considered, and experienced many things in my days, but thank God, I have not encountered or heard of a more beautiful gift in our times. To Christ, the Prince of Glory, be all glory, all victory, triumph, and dominion with His Father in the unity of the Spirit. Amen. Your reverence should also not disdain what is written in our vernacular, that is, not in Latin, as the teachers of the people in Wittenberg often do, who also with their golden calves cause much and significant fornication to the Lord Christ and are contrary to the way of the Lord, always as dominators of faith.</p>
      <p>With that, may the peace of God, which is Christ with His Spirit, be with you and all who love Christ the Lord, and with all who desire to embrace the truth lovingly, and to serve you and yours [friendly] with this and always willingly.</p>
      <p>I have otherwise not shared these gifts and booklets with anyone else in these lands, as I have also found few, even among us, who have had any inquiry about the kingdom of Christ to my knowledge, God have mercy; may He help us to the knowledge of Him and His Son, our Lord and King of grace, amen. Given in Baden in the year of our Lord, the Saturday after Ascension, 1553.</p>
      <p>H. Wilhelm von Laubenberg of Laubenbergerstein at Wagegg, etc., by my own hand.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, my residence is nearest to Kempten, so if you wish to write to me further at your convenience, in the castle Wagegg. You may write to me at your and any time's convenience at my expense, etc.</p>
      <p>To the reverend and beloved brothers in Christ, the ecclesiastics of Zurich, Lord Heinrich Bullinger and his associates, ministers of the word, etc. Zurich.</p>
