      <p>Greetings. Indeed, I did not write anything on the last two market days, as I was greatly distracted by cares and business. Now that I have received your most friendly letters along with the decrees of the 5th session, I could not refrain from writing these few lines to you. I thank you for the decrees, although I had them earlier; I would like to have the decrees of the 3rd and 4th sessions and to know whether the 6th session was held on September 17th and what was decreed. I see that what happens to me also happens to you: everyone wants to be written to and to inquire what is happening everywhere, yet they themselves are lazy and idle, neither inquiring even in the vicinity nor writing anything, unwilling and unable to work. Everything is completely disordered and neglected by everyone in a careless and negligent manner. But it would be better for us to know the decrees and plans of these people.</p>
      <p>You will see, you will see, you will experience, unless the Lord disrupts the council, that this very council, unprepared and without premeditation, will cause great harm. Therefore, if you can do anything, work; if nothing is given or sent, what can you do for me? I am well satisfied with you; I do not accuse you and your diligence, indeed I congratulate myself for having you, well-instructed, diligent, and hardworking. And because I truly love you, I share with you what I share with few; first, the letters of the Bishop of Salisbury from England, then the letters of Beza, in which he bids us farewell, for he descends through Bern and Basel to Strasbourg by post. There, Mr. Andelot awaited, with whom he follows the well-equipped German army, which I believe is now in France, as you will understand from the letters brought from Heidelberg. Yesterday, a trustworthy man was here, who said that he saw the entire troop marching in large and good formations towards Nancy in Lorraine, heading towards France. The same man said, as others also affirm, that in the month of September, English ships landed and were received at Saint-Valery and in the port of Dieppe, and that they have now set out against the enemy. May the Lord be with them, etc.</p>
      <p>The Bernese left Lyon on September 16th, having been greatly reduced by their own; yet 6 companies of Valaisans, Neuch√¢telois, Bielers, and Bernese remain there as reinforcements, the companies having been newly established. Mr. Andelot is also supposed to go there with 600 horses and 4000 foot soldiers, having achieved two glorious victories in Provence. It is thought that the 8 companies of the Confederates, who are now marching away, will have to go to Lyon or to the Germans, etc. May the Lord repay them according to His just judgment. Now the 31st year is passing since they slaughtered us at Capellas; but I know that God lives, etc. Brentius wrote an impure book against Martyr and me in both Latin and German, etc. I will not always write about this in the future; I do not care. There are also other matters that truly oppress and exhaust me.</p>
      <p>In Bern, the situation is contentious and bad. Praying to God for grace. The legates of the King of Spain in Switzerland have obtained permission to visit Basel on the day of the Three Kings for a friendly meeting and to resolve matters, etc. Saturday, October 10th. Yours, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed and beloved lord and compatriot. To the pastor at St. Martin's in Chur.</p>
