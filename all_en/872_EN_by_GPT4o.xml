      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord Jesus, etc. We give you thanks, Heinrich, dearest brother in Christ, and to your fellow workers for your care, work, and diligence not only towards us but also towards our church, indeed Christ's; for your counsel was so successful and present that we would stand by it, except that certain things needed to be discussed more broadly and extensively: for there were certain objections to be refuted or rather to be turned back against our adversaries. However, when we recited the apology to the senate and the people, they decided to adhere to their previous decision: My lords let it remain by their recognition, also wanting you to live by the same.</p>
      <p>There were (as we later learned from some faithful ones) those who wanted to impose on us even more things to be said and unsaid, people who are clearly godless. We respond to these that we cannot concede even a hair's breadth to them; for this matter is not ours, but belongs to both lords; they will have to account for both faith and treachery, as will we. Therefore, we have declared our opinion in writing, so that in the future they may have something by which they can judge both our opinion and our duty; finally offering (which advice also came from you) both the scriptures, which we stand by, and our bodies, which are in their power; they should consider with what honesty they can justify that violent decree both before God and before men, since we present to them clear scriptures and examples of Christ and the apostles and prophets.</p>
      <p>Finally, our requests are decided upon; they ask, however, that names be spared. If we had anything against anyone or against the senate itself, we should handle it in the court or through the consul or subordinates: we indeed remind them of their duty, that they should carry out in action what we teach in word; from there true peace and concord can be forged in the republic, and they will receive praise from both God and us. And so the senate is dismissed.</p>
      <p>There were some among the people who said that if we had yielded even a finger's breadth, great material would have been provided to the impious and they would attempt greater and more absurd things in the future; they also encouraged us to be steadfast; for our adversaries, being shamefully confused, can do nothing against us. If they intend to expel us, they will approach individuals in the future. Therefore, pray for us and our church to the Lord. My fellow workers greet you and the other learned ones. Hastily, in Schaffhausen, in the year 1550, March 28.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in doctrine and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
