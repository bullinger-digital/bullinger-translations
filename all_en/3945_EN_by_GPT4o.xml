      <p>Greetings. I received, most distinguished and esteemed sir, six French crowns and two Italian ones along with the letter addressed to your son, which I will send to him in Basel. I will add to them my own debt, which I owe to you, so that he lacks nothing, and I will send all these through the next reliable messenger. For a whole month, I have neither received letters from him nor heard anything; nevertheless, I believe that all is well with him. We are all well here by the grace of God.</p>
      <p>Because of certain arsonists, our affairs and those of all our neighbors are quite dangerous.</p>
      <p>Many are imprisoned for this reason.</p>
      <p>May the Lord deliver and protect us from evil! Peace has been made between the French and the Spanish, and there are men of great authority who suspect that plans are being made to restore antichristianism against the religion of Christ. Certain things are said about the Genevans and others, about which you perhaps know better.</p>
      <p>I received letters from England dated April 8, which also announce that peace has been proclaimed in London between the English, French, and Scots. The Parliament was still in session then; they call the assembly and council of the whole kingdom the Parliament. It has indeed been renounced to the Pope, but the true religion has not yet been restored and reestablished.</p>
      <p>There was a debate by deputies through the Parliament and the Queen; nine were selected from each side, evangelicals and papists; but due to the obstinacy of some disputing bishops, the colloquium was interrupted, and two bishops from the papists, of Winchester and Lincoln, were captured.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the matter of restoring the religion that was in use throughout England during the time of the recently deceased Edward is again being discussed in Parliament. May the Lord grant His spirit to that council.</p>
      <p>The Queen burns with zeal for the holy religion, the nobility burns, and the people are very frequent in sermons. Those learned men who were exiles with us in Geneva, Bern, Basel, Strasbourg, Frankfurt, and elsewhere in Germany and have returned to their homeland preach vigorously. They write of the admirable progress of the gospel.</p>
      <p>We daily expect more certain news from the Diet of Augsburg, which our envoy, who was sent together with yours and those of other Swiss, will bring to Augsburg. I hear that the princes do not agree well among themselves about religion and that there are disputes; but, as I said, we expect more certain news. Live and farewell, and consider these things well; for I could not write more now.</p>
      <p>I eagerly await yours.</p>
      <p>May your whole household be safe, your father, the venerable old man, especially Mr. Travers and other good men.</p>
      <p>I wonder if you have received the booklets I sent, titled Bericht, etc.</p>
      <p>Your brother Hector is well.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 6, 1559.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you; Mr. Martyr and others greet you.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Friedrich von Salis, most worthy commissioner of Chiavenna, his esteemed lord and dearest brother. To young Mr. Friedrich von Salis, commissioner in Chiavenna.</p>
