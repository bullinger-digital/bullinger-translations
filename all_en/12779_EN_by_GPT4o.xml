    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] It would be almost impossible for Kilchmeyer to report in detail on the events taking place in Bern. However, since he has some time, he wants to share just one example from which the astute Bullinger can gauge how much Christ's cause (for the sake of which he has successfully taken up the fight against the rhetorically cunning but poorly armed beasts) is making pleasing and rapid progress in Bern. Like the old Entellus, he was not driven to flight by the two younger boxers Dares [Simon Sulzer and Beat Gering], let alone defeated! It even seems to him (to boast in the Lord like Paul) as if God has let him grow eagle's wings again, indeed as if the exercises resulting from this confrontation have made him once again a brave, fairly robust young man well-prepared to counter the attacks still to come; which he also owes to Bullinger's treatise ["De sacramentis"]. However, he knows that he has almost no leisure left and hardly comes to eat. During the day he has to answer many; at night his thoughts plague him and the study of the Holy Scriptures exhausts him. But enough of that! For with the Apostle Paul, he may say that God gives him strength in his weakness and leads him by the hand, so that everything seems pleasant and simple to him for Christ and the salvation of His Church, especially since he hopes for an early end to his mission [in Bern] and the corresponding reward, as well as a recall to Zurich (as a servant who was not entirely useless), since he does not intend (God willing) to die in Bern. But back to the announced example!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The Bernese authorities are full of zeal for Christ's kingdom. They defend, protect, and spread it! Recently, they unanimously decided that the young people to be trained for the pastorate with public funds in the future should be sent to Zurich. Bullinger will learn this from the letter of the Bernese council delivered by the public messenger [...]. He, in turn, should ensure that what Kilchmeyer was able to achieve with God's help with the Bernese council, he can also enforce with the Zurich council, namely, that Zurich boys are sent to Bern for study, especially since the school has been cleansed of Lutheran filth and the teaching from now on will be conducted by the very learned Eberhard von Rümlang and Nikolaus Pfister, who do not need to be recommended to Bullinger in view of their integrity and diligence in teaching. If he could achieve something like this with the Zurich council, it would only strengthen the harmony and relations between Bern and Zurich, which is very desirable in these turbulent times. Bullinger should also ensure that the welfare of the young people sent from Bern is well taken care of in Zurich and that the knowledge necessary for salvation is imparted to them by Johannes Fries or another Zurich scholar, so that they can assist the churches and this brings fame and gratitude to the city of Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Together with Rümlang, Pfister, and the assistant Johannes Wäber (all of whom eagerly await regular letters from Bullinger and Rudolf Gwalther), Kilchmeyer sends greetings to Bullinger, his wife Anna [née Adlischwyler], Gwalther, the godfather Johann Jakob Ammann, Theodor Bibliander, Fries, Rudolf Collin, and the other colleagues. Bullinger should be content with what has been communicated here until Kilchmeyer has it less strict, and not forget to recommend him to the mayors Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab as well as the entire council.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace. Most learned and beloved brother in the Lord, I want you to know that it is utterly impossible to inform you in full detail of the events that have taken place in Bern up to now, even if I had many hours to do so. Therefore, as I have found a brief moment to write, I will briefly reveal to you one thing from many, from which you, with your astuteness, can easily judge how happily Christ's cause is advancing and triumphing among us. Indeed, for this reason, I am constantly at war with beasts that are sharp in words but so weak in claws and arms that, like the old Entellus, I have not been driven to flight by the two younger boxers Dares [Simon Sulzer and Beat Gering], let alone defeated! It even seems to me, to boast in the Lord like Paul, that my old age is being renewed by the Lord like the eagle's, and that through this holy exercise, as often happens, I am becoming more youthful, lively, and robust enough for future assaults, for which I owe much to your writings. Dearest brother in the Lord, I have no leisure, no rest, not even for taking food: During the day, I am compelled to respond to many, and at night, thoughts, readings, and holy studies torment, worry, and wear me out. But why do I complain? I may confess with the Apostle (praise be to God) that my strength is made perfect in weakness and that I am uplifted, touched, and led by the Lord's benevolent hand, so that for the glory of our Savior and Lord Jesus Christ and the salvation of His Church, everything is pleasant, light, sweet, and agreeable to me, especially since I hope for an end to my labors soon with a reward, and to be recalled to Zurich as not entirely a useless servant, for I have not decided to spend the rest of my life in Bern, if the Lord grants my wishes. Now I will return to show you that one thing, from which you can estimate how all the rest is proceeding favorably.</p>

      <p>Our most illustrious magistrate is now very fervent for the kingdom of Christ, to vindicate, protect, and finally propagate it. By unanimous consent, they have recently decreed that those to be educated for the ministry of the Church with public funds should be sent to Zurich, which you will abundantly understand from the letters sent to the most honorable council of Zurich by the public messenger. Therefore, it will be your task to ensure that what the King of Kings perhaps obtained through me with the Bernese, you also achieve and obtain from your, indeed our, lords in Zurich, so that they, in turn, send their own to us, especially since the schools have now been purged of Lutheran dregs and entrusted to the best and most learned men, namely Eberhard von Rümlang and Nikolaus Pfister, whose holy integrity and diligence in educating the youth in a holy and free manner are more known to you than my testimony and declaration are needed. If you comply and apply your efforts (of which I have no doubt), it will certainly serve to arouse and nurture the concord and mutual affection of those two cities, which we need more than bread and wine in these turbulent times. Now, to conclude, I ask you, as I have been asked, to ensure that those young people, when they appear, are treated with dignity concerning their livelihood, and that they especially draw the knowledge of eternal salvation from our Fries or another from the circle of scholars, so that when they are finally recalled, they can be useful to the Church of God and bring praise and thanksgiving to you.</p>

      <p>Together with me, Eberhard von Rümlang, Herr Pfister, and Johannes Wäber, the deacon, all of whom eagerly await regular letters from you and Herr Rudolf, send greetings to you, your wife Anna [née Adlischwyler], Rudolf Gwalther, Johann Jakob Ammann, my faithful godfather, Theodor Bibliander, Fries, Rudolf Collin, and all other brothers in the Lord. Farewell in the Lord, and be content with what has been communicated here until I have it less strict. Please do not neglect to always have me recommended to the mayors Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab and the entire council. Again, farewell. Given in Bern, on the 30th day of December in the year 1547. Jodocus Kilchmeyer, most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Herr Heinrich Bullinger, supreme head of the most honorable Church of Zurich, his lord and brother in Christ, to be revered in every way.</p>
