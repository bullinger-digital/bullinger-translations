    <p xml:id="regest1">Hans Geßler has reported to Bullinger about the negotiations concerning [Wilhelm] Frölich and others before the council. For the confrontation with the pension lords - especially with the city clerk [Ludwig Sterner] - he requests assistance with arguments; [Rudolf] Rebstock wants to give up military service, in accordance with the laws of Zurich and Bern. There is a rumor that Luther has agreed with the Swiss on the issue of the Lord's Supper. Ulrich [Fischer], the very modest man, recommends himself through his knowledge of Greek. Greetings; Johannes [Bullinger] should be spared from evil peasants.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Whenever I have the opportunity to send messages to you, dearest brother, through trustworthy messengers, my mind is ready to write to you, not for any other reason than to assure you that I have not forgotten you and yours, even though I am certain that due to your frequent occupations, you do not have much time to read what I might ask or request. Therefore, you have been briefly informed by Hans Geßler about what I have done before the council on behalf of those from Zurich, Frölich, and the others. The council still stands by the same opinion.</p>
      <p>Now, my comrade and I have a matter with certain pension lords, among whom our city clerk, a protégé of these Harpies, is the most prominent, cunning and shrewd as this kind of people usually are, working with amazing tricks against us to make our efforts cease. May He, whose everything we do is, grant us the wisdom of serpents and the simplicity of doves; eventually, we will escape the man's cunning. There is one thing, however, that I ask without you: how far do these words in the oath obligation extend: "faithfully and without deceit." I have heard from you once and again, but due to various vexations I was suffering at the time, the meaning slipped away. Then the city clerk says: "If the money is right in the common purse, then it is right with me too." Thus he argues with everyone. What should be answered to this, you should briefly resolve, or if you have anything in writing, you might want to communicate it to me through that good man. I would only wish to be with you for a single hour. But that is not possible, to discuss these matters with you. Vitis, who is also among those people, however, does not oppose, has confessed that he will leave the honorary office, as they call it, according to the statutes of Zurich and Bern.</p>
      <p>Then, dearest brother, there is a rumor among us, which I wish were not true, that Luther has agreed with us on the matter of the Eucharist. If that is true, I do not believe it, yet if it is true, he has done what I would never have believed; but I desire to know the truth from you.</p>
      <p>Our Ulrich, a good and learned man, has greatly commended me with his knowledge of Greek letters. However, I fear that this man will someday have to give an account to Him, whose talent he has hidden.</p>
      <p>In his name and mine, greet your dearest mother along with your wife, all the brothers, the friendly tanner, Peter's host; finally, your brother Johannes, whom may that most excellent and greatest God provide for and defend from evil peasants, I say evil; for there is not a great number of good ones. Lastly, as I have often said, and now say again, I commend myself to your faith and charity, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>From Biel, April 13, in the year 37.</p>
      <p>Your Peter.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor and minister of the divine word of the church of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed patron.</p>
