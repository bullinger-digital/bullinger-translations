      <p>The almighty good Lord and God grant you and all your relatives a good and prosperous year, etc. beforehand.</p>
      <p>Well-learned, honorable, my particularly gracious and dear sir, I hereby send you and your wife the cheese and capon for the good year, with a very friendly request to kindly accept this small gift, as I am particularly eager and most willing to always show friendship and service to you and yours.</p>
      <p>Following this, dear Master Heinrich, I heard yesterday in Winterthur how my lords are willing to come to an agreement with the Five Cantons. I was very shocked by this, as we must rely on the law. Therefore, my friendly request to you is to inform me about the situation, also what Bern and other Christian cities have to say about it, and how things stand.</p>
      <p>Let me also know how my dispute with Berger stands.</p>
      <p>And hereby I commend you to the protection of the almighty God, who may graciously strengthen you, so that you may bravely carry out His work.</p>
      <p>Given in Illnau, Sunday after Thomas, in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant</p>
      <p>Hans Rudolf Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Great Minster in Zurich, my particularly dear and trusted lord.</p>
