    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Five months ago, Medmann received Bullinger's letter [not received] along with the enclosed book gift. Currently, he can only thank him for it, but he will reciprocate if he ever discovers [a book] among his people in Cologne that he assumes the people of Zurich do not yet possess. He also thanks Bullinger for his kindness and hopes, with God's grace, to prove himself worthy of this friendship.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Medmann further apologizes for responding to Bullinger's detailed and benevolent letter with only this brief note. Should he return safely to his homeland [Cologne], he will write in detail and inform about the events and his experiences. He has been riding around for about four months and reached the camp the day before yesterday. May the famous [Swiss] people understand what the greedy Austrian Charles [V] intends with this war! Medmann fears that many might understand this too late...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Duke Maurice of Saxony has, against all treaties and his obligation to Germany, unexpectedly declared war on the Elector [John Frederick of Saxony], and that too in this dire time!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings to all colleagues. Medmann would have replied long ago if he could remember the content of Bullinger's letter. In haste, from the field camp.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Five months ago, I received a long letter from you along with a book sent as a gift, for which I thank you at this time and promise to reciprocate someday if I find something among my people in Cologne that might not have reached you. I acknowledge your kindness towards me, which you so generously offer in your letter, and by God's grace, I will conduct myself in our sacredly established friendship so that it may grow into a lasting bond, enduring as long as the Almighty Father wills us to be here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>You must forgive me, out of your humanity, for finally writing these notes in response to your full and most gracious letter. If God, as I indeed hope, restores me to my homeland, I will respond to you in detail and write about other matters that have happened or might happen in my presence. For now, I have been riding around for the fourth month and reached our camp the day before yesterday. If only your renowned nation would understand what Charles of Austria seeks with his greedy war, which I fear many will understand too late, my dear Bullinger, if, God most mercifully avert it, Charles were to gain victory.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Maurice, Duke of Saxony, has declared war on the Elector, against all agreements, against all expectations, and against German loyalty, and that too in this most calamitous time!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell well and happily, most distinguished man, and continue to love me as you have begun.</p>
      <p>November 8, 1546.</p>
      <p>Commend me to all the ministers of your church. I would have replied to you already, especially since I was certain, but I could not remember the contents of your letter. From the camp. In haste.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Petrus Medmann.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his singular and esteemed. Zurich.</p>
