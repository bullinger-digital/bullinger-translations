    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Johannes and his family are well. Hopefully, this is also true for his brother Heinrich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Enclosed, for the new year, is the monetary share that is due to Heinrich. If Johannes could have counted on the help of others, he would have received more. As it is, he must be content with 8. 4 of these are from the bailiff [Jakob Freytag]. If anything else comes in the next few days, Heinrich will also receive his share of it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Who will come to Kilchberg [as pastor], and what news is there to report?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Johannes is currently very tired. If he manages to catch something [while hunting] in the coming days, he will go to Zurich himself.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Blessing wish.</p>
