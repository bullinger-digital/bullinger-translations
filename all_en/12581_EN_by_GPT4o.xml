    <p xml:id="regest1">The letter bearer [Hans Schöner] is an honorable man from a respected Augsburg family, who, however, suffered injustice a few years ago due to influential relatives. Bullinger should provide him with favorable accommodation, as he has lost a lot of money due to this legal dispute and has not been able to rehabilitate himself so far. Blarer has already intervened on his behalf in Augsburg but could not achieve anything and is now pursuing another plan, which Schöner will report. Since he does not like to stay in the imperial cities out of fear of his enemies, he believes it would be better for him to stay in [Zurich] until the end of the war. Schöner's wife [Dietburg, née Schellenberger] and children [Anna and Maria] are in Strasbourg. Bullinger will probably also write to [Hans] Welser, [Jakob] Herbrot, and [Georg] Frölich in this matter, who are not responsible for Schöner's misfortune but are rather critical of him because of his writing [“Warhafftige anzaigung”]. Some of those responsible for Schöner's misery are no longer in Augsburg; for example, the former mayor Wolfgang Rehlinger, who has moved to [Strasbourg].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Blarer encloses a letter addressed to him by Welser, so that Bullinger may determine for himself why he has no objections to Welser, unlike Frölich. It was Welser who introduced the Reformation in Augsburg in his first year as mayor [1537] and was therefore highly esteemed, as Blarer himself could ascertain during his stay in Augsburg [1539]. Welser's Christian and selfless correspondence with Blarer is further proof of his sincerity.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Otherwise, there is little news to report. They are still waiting for news [about the course of the war on the Danube] and for the statement of Duke [Wilhelm] of Bavaria [regarding the Schmalkaldic League]. If he does not grant them passage [through his territories], it will be difficult for them, as Ingolstadt has been heavily fortified against the Turks in recent years, and capturing the city would take a long time, which Emperor [Charles V] could use for armament.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The Augsburg councilor Hans Zangmeister writes that the Emperor has left the still heavily occupied Regensburg and moved to Landshut to set up his camp there and unite with the papal troops. The imperial army already comprises about 40,000 soldiers, but so far not even 1,000 mercenaries have been recruited from Austria and Bohemia. Allegedly, the country [Bohemia or Austria and Bohemia?] would like to surrender if it could be done appropriately. Bavaria is overrun by the imperial troops.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- In Frölich's letter, written one day before Zangmeister's writing, the Emperor's departure [to Landshut] is not yet mentioned. It only refers to the still pending response of the [Duke] of Bavaria. Frölich also sent the song enclosed with the present letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- God have mercy on us! The outcome of the war is uncertain and lies in God's hands. Surely, He takes care of His own, even if they must die, especially since they would then exchange the transient earthly life for eternal life.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- King [Ferdinand] remains calm and is not recruiting troops in Bohemia and Austria. The Schmalkaldic League, for their part, is trying not to make him an enemy, to avoid provoking an attack in Swabia, Sundgau, Breisgau, or Alsace, as this would force them to divide their army. Therefore, they have also informed the King that they have only temporarily and out of sheer necessity taken the pass [Ehrenberg] to prevent the enemy's passage.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- [The Schmalkaldic League] has very high expenses, which they cannot bear in the long term. So far, the people of Konstanz have paid 16,000 guilders. Now the same amount is due again.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- [P.S.:] Bullinger should ensure that [Hans Schöner] finds affordable accommodation. The war will probably end soon. Then Schöner's fate should also improve, for which Blarer will also actively work.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, especially trusted, dear lord and brother. Zöger is indeed a good, pious man, from a good, honest family and lineage in Augsburg, who, however, has been unjustly treated there due to the actions of some of his influential brothers-in-law, who were then very powerful (influential) in Augsburg, and some still are, etc., as he will be able to report to you in detail when you have time. I kindly ask you to have him recommended in a friendly and Christian manner, in case he might find accommodation with you or elsewhere, where he would not have to spend much. He has never had much surplus. He has lost several thousand guilders due to this matter. He has tried everything, but has not been able to achieve anything so far. I myself have written to the mayors and some other council members in Augsburg on his behalf. They have been very angry with me, and consequently with him, but there is no progress. I now have another plan for him, if God wills that this double luck comes to pass, as he will explain to you. In the meantime, he does not like to stay in the imperial cities. He is always worried that something burdensome might be done to him by his envious opponents. He thought it would be most bearable and safe to follow my advice and stay with you for a few weeks until the military exercise is well and successfully concluded. Therefore, you would be doing a work of Christian love by helping him, only by providing him with a suitable lodging, as it is indeed a very good work and great alms to be helpful and comforting to such old troubled people. He has a very honorable wife and dear children in Strasbourg. They are all good, godly people. Therefore, do your best. When you learn more about his situation over time, you will also be able to write to Welser, Herbrot, Lęto, etc., on his behalf. They do not want to offend him, although it did not happen through them. But his open writing has somewhat displeased them. They do not want to let him have his way in some matters. But in summary, I know very well that he was treated unfavorably in the main matter. Those who were most to blame for it are no longer in Augsburg, like Wolfgang Rechlinger, who was then mayor, but later left out of fear and concern for some matters, which are not to be written about. God will still find them all in his time and repay them for their unfaithfulness and mistreatment. Amen, amen!</p>

      <p>I am sending you a letter herewith. It came to me last Sunday from Welser. I cannot judge it as false or unjust, although Letu thinks the reason is of no use. He conducted himself very well and excellently in the first year of his office, had great effort and work, and proved himself so bravely that all the pious, as I was in Augsburg, in the council and outside, have given him good praise. For at that time the priests were still in the city, and under him, mass, idols, and other things were abolished, so that some cunningly pushed the office away from them onto him. He writes me very many entirely Christian letters, so I could not think why he would do it if he were not serious. For he has nothing to expect from me, neither honor nor goods. He would well spare such work and, according to the custom of the rich of this world, rather go idle than work in vain. I could not tell you everything for reasons.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>We have no special news at the moment. We are waiting every hour to see how the matter has developed and what the Duke of Bavaria will answer. If he has refused the pass, it will be effort and work, for Ingolstadt has been made very strong against the Turks for many years now. They would have to work for a while. In the meantime, the emperor would also better prepare himself.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>At this moment, I am being written from Augsburg that the emperor has moved from Regensburg and gone to Landshut. There he wants to set up camp. However, Regensburg is strongly occupied. The pope's troops are also supposed to be sent to Landshut. It is believed that he is now 40,000 strong, not counting those who are still to join him. From all of Austria and Bohemia, he has not yet recruited 1,000 men, for no one wants to let themselves be ordered. And it is said that the country would gladly surrender if God would now grant that they could do it appropriately. The Bavarian land is ruined by the emperor's troops, whichever way they go. This is what Zangmeister writes to me. This is written to me by Hans Zangmeister, a councilor in Augsburg and a very pious man.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>But Letus writes nothing about the emperor's departure. His letter is, however, a day older than Zangmeister's. Perhaps this news only came later and through Zangmeister? Letus writes nothing new, except that they are waiting every hour to hear the Duke's answer. He also sent me some carmina, which I would like to share with you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Oh, my Bullinger! Let us not cease to be supplicants to the Lord until He has mercy on us. The war is still uncertain if you estimate it by human reasoning on both sides. But I know that not a hair of our head will perish without the will of the heavenly and best Father, who will also restore with great interest in the resurrection of the righteous what perishes for His cause. What is lived here is perishable, fleeting, and more than evanescent, so that it is not greatly to be mourned, but rather to be rejoiced, if we exchange this life full of daily death for eternal and solid life.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The king still sits quietly on both sides, not calling up anyone from his lands, nor the Bohemians and Austrians, except what runs itself; not many of them. For ours have not yet done the same, as if they also consider the king an enemy, so that he also sits quietly and does not make any opposition to us here above (in the south) in the landvogtei Swabia, likewise in Sundgau, Breisgau, Alsace, etc. Therefore, ours have also given the king an answer regarding the pass, that they have taken it, not that they want to keep it, but only out of unavoidable necessity, so that the enemy may not have a pass through it, etc., although they have enough reason against him. But they intend to arrange everything so that the king does not also cause unrest, and we have to divide our army. But if God gives luck on our side, then everyone will be well found for his penny.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>On our side, an unbearable cost is running up, which no one could endure if it were to last a while. My lords have now paid sixteen thousand guilders and now they must pay the same amount again. But keep this from anyone else.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Commend us diligently to the Lord. August 13.</p>
      <p>Let Zöger be recommended to you for God's and Christian love, also for my sake, entirely and faithfully, in case he might find accommodation with a people for the least cost. It is, I hope, only a short time until we will see whether we must become bishop or barber. Then, I hope to God, his situation will improve. I will call upon everyone so that he does not become completely indebted, the good old honorable man.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable servant of Jesus Christ, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, venerable and dearest brother. Zurich.</p>
