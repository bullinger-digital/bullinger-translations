      <p>Greetings. I received your letter, most esteemed Bullinger, along with your most learned discourses on the matter of the Eucharist in good faith, for which I confess I owe you greatly, as you overwhelm me daily with new benefits, to which I can indeed be grateful, but by no means equal, as I can only offer you my efforts in few and trivial matters. We have absolutely no news, although there is a rumor that some German princes are now opposed to the cruelty of the Margrave, so that by force they may also recall the man to better ways from the established cruelty by which Germany is shaken. All is silent here with us; for we have heard nothing even about the Saxon expedition, of which you write. I am sending you a true, yet poetic description of the papist kingdom published by Naogeorgus, which I trust will not be unpleasing to you due to the nature of its subject. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Hastily from Basel, June 22, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
