      <p>Greetings, excellent Bullinger. I am writing this from Straßburg, where I arrived six days ago and am leaving today. I have discussed some of my writings with Dr. Martyr, who pleased me greatly. I brought here the book of Cardinal Pole, which greatly stirs the souls of all the pious; I will ensure that you can also see it. I have read a large part of the history that Sleidan is preparing; I hope it will greatly disturb the unfortunate papacy, which is primarily concerned with extinguishing the light that has arisen in this blessed age. But this history will almost make it more illustrious. I do not regret the labor and expense I incurred coming here, since I seem to have contributed much to it and can continue to do so. I saw your son, who truly pleases me, and you wisely sent him here; he has already wonderfully adapted to the charming manners of the English, you would say he is one of them. I saw him daily in Martyr's lecture hall; may God keep him for you.</p>
      <p>I did not see Morosinus, whom I so greatly desired to meet; he went down to Worms, and also to Cologne to seek out a certain famous doctor to treat his son's knee. Finally, I think there will be a future assembly; I know what I am saying. They say the Margrave of Brandenburg is in Metz, and the Duke of Brunswick with a large force of infantry and cavalry will soon go to the Emperor. Thus Germany would be freed from war. Farewell and be well; pray for me with your whole family, school, and church.</p>
      <p>Straßburg, July 26, 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
