      <p>S. D. For a long time now, dearest Bullinger in the Lord, I have received no letters from our Haller; I believe the reason is that I have not yet settled in any fixed place where he could send letters. I am therefore informing him of where I am and what the state of my affairs is; I ask you to send the enclosed letters to him whenever the opportunity arises.</p>
      <p>As for my wife's health, I still cannot predict where it will end. During the day, she seems to be better and gives hope of a quick recovery; but at night, she is almost consumed by fever, so much so that she sometimes struggles with a lapse of reason and mind. Two days ago, a fever also set in. The children, who were ill, are beginning to recover by the grace of the Lord, so that now I am uncertain only about my wife's health. I commend her, myself, and all my affairs to your prayers and those of your church. I know, I know the mercy of Christ the Savior, for whose eternal truth I have given myself to this exile, is so great and so certain that He will soon put an end to these troubles; in the meantime, however, it is both pious and necessary to use the prayers of the pious in the sight of God, which are always of great importance.</p>
      <p>About Lord Leto, the chief grammarian of Augsburg, you may have already heard that he has been removed from the office he held by the new magistrate of Augsburg.</p>
      <p>If you have anything about Frecht, please write. Farewell excellently; greetings to your most honorable wife, children, brothers, and friends.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, 8th of September, 1548.</p>
      <p>Wolf[gang] Musculus, yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Since Froschauer has rented out his house to others, in the meantime, I beseech you to look around for a place where I can stay with my family; for as soon as my wife either recovers or departs to the Lord, I will come to you, unless I am hindered by the will of the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, most esteemed lord and brother. Zürich.</p>
