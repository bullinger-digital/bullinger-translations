      <p>Greetings. I immediately delivered your letter addressed to Mr. Oporinus, who also responded, but I have not yet been able to send the other letter to Count Georg. However, he promised these days to take care of it, as he resides here. The English agents among us are very sorrowful because their brothers have not been received by our people, and, as I see it, we will have to work to retain those to whom the opportunity to reside has been given so far; thus, the love towards the members of Christ is growing cold. I wish to know what advice you have given to Mr. Lever, whose company would have been most pleasing to me if he had happened to reside here; I seem to have noticed in him a sincere and ardent piety combined with the utmost moderation of judgment and sweetness of manners. I pray to the Lord Jesus that He may mercifully guide and preserve this holy heart with his own. Vesalius writes from the Belgians that the Emperor has torn apart his chancellery and is now acting privately, no longer using the service of more than 12 men.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours, whom I wish to greet with my respectful words.</p>
      <p>Basel, May 6, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
