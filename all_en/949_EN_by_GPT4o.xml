      <p>Greetings, most excellent man. Since I knew that you are held by an uncommon desire to know the fate of the still recent Church of Christ among the English, and since the opportunity was not given to Mr. John Hooper to write to your excellency, so that you would not be completely unaware of the matters that are happening here, I have diligently written to you about what I could learn; but as I was able to learn from your latest letters sent to Mr. Hooper, all my letters to you were lost or intercepted, since you make no mention of those I wrote to you. Therefore, if you receive letters from us less frequently, attribute it not to my negligence, but to the untrustworthiness of people. I do not wish to recount every single thing that has happened to us, since you can learn better and more certainly from the letters of Mr. Hooper and from this man. I only wish to repeat here about a certain young man from Zürich, named Valentin Werdmüller, whose father is the treasurer of your city. He followed the wars and finally came to England with an unfortunate voyage, since after a few months he was captured in the field and brought to London and shortly after, through the accusation of some peasants, was condemned for the theft of nearly one shilling. When we, men of the German nation, learned of this, we thought it pious to redeem this young man, if it could be done, because he promised better things and his appearance bore a certain nobility.</p>
      <p>Great efforts were made, and finally the king's pardon was obtained, but at a cost, since unexpectedly about 19 or 20 French crowns had to be paid. This money was scraped together from everywhere; if it could be reimbursed by his parents, the principal part or the whole of this money would return to our poor Germans, who have fled here for the sake of the gospel, stripped of all their goods.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, this young man is compelled to stay in London until Michaelmas, having given an oath; in the meantime, he is supported by good men. The good men greatly desire to know something certain about his parents. Farewell, and may you deign to commend me to Mr. Froschauer. I would wish that he would send me the Zürich chronicles at the next fair at the price he sold them to me, namely for three and a half florins; I will faithfully ensure that he receives the price. May the Lord preserve your church and guide it with His Holy Spirit. Amen. London, June 28, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Martin Micronius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant doctor of the Church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
