      <p> Greetings. Knowing, honorable sir and godfather, that our German school will soon be vacant again. However, the Lindiner does not act as if he were worthy of the promotion; we have suffered much disgrace and shame from him and his children. Therefore, if the honorable man, about whom you once wrote to me, is available and willing to take on this school (although I have not yet spoken to anyone and cannot promise anything definite at this time), it would not be unfruitful if you could send me one or two of his writings; I would like to discuss this quietly with the mayors. For the Lindiner is also seeking the position again; but I think if we had another capable, pious man, we would tell the Lindiner to take his leave. We cannot get rid of this shameless man; he is drunk day and night, but from where? This to you in secret: his children are thieves. Recently, the youngest, Rudolf, ran away after stealing two ducats and more money. I fear I will have to take some action against him, which I would rather not see. Therefore, the sooner, the better to be rid of him. Please let me know your helpful response. </p>
      <p> Someone could earn a nice sum by writing alongside the school. If the honorable man were inclined, it would not hurt if you wrote a small letter to the mayors on his behalf, nothing more than that you had understood (not from me) that the German school would be vacant; a capable, God-fearing man is available. The sooner one takes action, the better, before another settles in. </p>
      <p> With this, entrusted to God. </p>
      <p> Given in Chur on the 13th of March in the year of our Lord 1562. Your willing servant, Hans Schmid. </p>
      <p> To the honorable, highly learned sir, Heinrich Bullinger, head of the church in Zurich, to respond to his honorable lord. </p>
