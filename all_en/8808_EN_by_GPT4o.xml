      <p>Your most learned refutation of the papal bull is circulating in everyone's hands, for it speaks in English and was printed in London. You have done well to have responded so diligently to the foolish and furious testament of Brenz.</p>
      <p>Silence has been imposed on those three contentious preachers in the Belgio-German church, and two others have been appointed in their place; 17 from the same church were expelled from our city on the first of November due to the foul vice of drunkenness. Around the middle of December, the Spanish envoy was ordered to leave England within three days (under the penalty of beheading); for so someone wrote to me from London; but whether this is true, I do not know. Certainly, he has gone, departed, escaped.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Norfolk on the 16th of January from seven in the morning until seven at night pleaded his case in Westminster Hall. Many charges of treason were brought against him, which he refuted as best he could. The entire examination and judgment of his case was devolved to nine earls, one viscount, and fifteen barons. All of them unanimously pronounced him guilty, and thus he was finally sentenced to death.</p>
      <p>However, he still lives in the Tower of London between hope and fear. Last year, the snow melted around the beginning of February. This year, it only began to melt around the beginning of March.</p>
      <p>We are on good terms with the French; but the Spanish frown. I give immense thanks for that most elegant little book on the authority of scripture and the church; whoever composed it is certainly a learned and pious man. If your Zwingli needs our help, it will not be in vain; I wish you and him to be most assured of this. Certainly, I will never disappoint your opinion of me. I cannot write more; for I am overwhelmed with many and serious affairs.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my Bullinger. Greet all friends. Mine to you all. Hastily from Ludham, 10th of March 1572.</p>
      <p>Yours, John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich. To the distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
