    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the apology sent to him as a gift against Cochläus [„Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio“] - Cochläus’ book „De autoritate ecclesiae“ he could have procured for him - and praises his defense of Zwingli; a letter from Oecolampadius, in which he skillfully justifies Zwingli's involvement in the war, is not at hand, otherwise he would send it. He is pleased about the apparently imminent publication of Zwingli's works; how wonderful it would be if he could do the same for Oecolampadius' works; his edition of some Psalms [-sermons of Oecolampadius] is intended as a foretaste and sample. Myconius, who reluctantly told him about Bullinger's letter [No. 1846] and suspects a brother of denouncing him in Zurich, has again distanced himself from an overly crude understanding of the Lord's Supper last Sunday; he writes to Bullinger himself [No. 1866]. Emperor [Charles V.] consoles himself with a hunting trip over the death of a priest. Gast would have sent [the Apocalypse commentary of] Primasius if it had already been printed. Bucer, who has completed his book against Latomus, has been summoned by the Archbishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied] to the Diet [in Speyer]. A plague has claimed many victims in Basel. Numerous captains are here. Greetings; he is ready to send his works to Theodor [Bibliander] upon request.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I received the apology against Cochläus and I am very grateful for such an elegant gift. I glanced through some of it during dinner, and I am extremely pleased with everything. I could have provided you with Cochläus' book on the authority of the church, if I had known, so that you could refute all of it more conveniently. You are excellently defending Zwingli, a divine man, both from this impostor and from others. I have a letter from Oecolampadius, in which he so skillfully justifies Zwingli's involvement in the war that even the adversaries could not oppose it; if it had been at hand, I would have sent it to you.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I received some drafts in which you wrapped your apology; good God, how much joy I felt that you are going to publish all the works of the divine Zwingli! If only there were enough leisure time and we could undertake something similar with the works of Oecolampadius, although I have not yet despaired; for I want to give a taste in those psalms I sent you, and I will try to see if my style, indeed rough and unpolished, will be pleasing to the reader. Therefore, I await your judgment.</p>
      <p>Myconius spoke to me these days about your letter sent to him, to which I had previously given him the opportunity to comment on this matter, and I could barely extract from him a brief explanation of what you had written. He has a suspicion about some brother who has denounced him to you and the brothers in Zurich. He said he wants to write to you extensively about this matter, and last Sunday, when we were celebrating the Lord's Supper, he repeated those words that he does not speak of the sacramental bread in a crude and Capernaitic manner. But about these matters, as he told me, you will have a long letter.</p>
      <p>I have nothing about the diet at this time. The Emperor is occupied with hunting to somewhat console his disturbed mind over the sudden death of his priest.</p>
      <p>You will soon have Primasius; it is not yet completed, or I would have already sent it. Bucer has completed his book against Latomus and has been summoned to the diet by the Archbishop of Cologne.</p>
      <p>Many have died among us in recent days from a sudden death and a very intense fever, and this disease no longer afflicts anyone.</p>
      <p>There is a multitude of captains among us, full of drunkards. Farewell in the Lord. Greet Theodor in my name, and if I knew he would appreciate it, I would send my works. I wish all happiness to you and your wife from me and mine.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 16, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, always to be honored as his teacher. Zurich.</p>
