    <p xml:id="regest1">The bearer Johannes Fabricius [Hans Schmid] has asked Myconius for a testimonial intended for the [Zurichers] for the time he lived with Myconius, which Myconius cannot refuse, regardless of his relationship with the addressees; Fabricius is as a relative [Konrad] Pellikan, Konrad [Lycostehenes], recommended him, namely good, pleasant, and easy to get along with, and Myconius sees him as a teacher, after he will have been an assistant teacher for a while, because without experience it is difficult to work as a teacher; the rest is to be learned from him himself.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, who delivers this letter, asked me to provide a testimonial for him to you for the time he stayed in my house, as he asserted it was necessary. I, regardless of my standing with you, could not refuse his request. Therefore, I will be brief, so as not to be burdensome with many words.</p>
      <p>I found him to be as Master Cunhardus, the relative of Mr. Pellicanus, recommended before I took him in, for I was indeed serving him in this matter. He is good, pleasant, and able to live with any honest person without causing trouble. You can learn about his diligence in studies from his teachers, as I am too occupied with other matters to attend to this myself. However, I freely say that I would recommend him as a schoolmaster, provided he first serves as an assistant teacher for a time. You know yourselves how difficult it is to act as a teacher if one lacks any practical experience in their art. The rest you can learn from him in person.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ and consider this recommendation favorably. Basel, May 21, 1544.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Konrad Pellikan, and Theodor Bibliander, most learned men in every respect, my most esteemed superiors in the Lord.</p>
