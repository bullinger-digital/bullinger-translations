      <p>Greetings. I return to you, most esteemed lord, father, and godfather, those things which you sent to me in past days, and I give you the greatest thanks for them.</p>
      <p>The lord consul and all the lords, most of whom have read and seen these things, also express their thanks. We have nothing special to add to these, except that soldiers are being secretly recruited everywhere; but for what purpose, it is not yet clear. I hear this is also happening in our Savoy. The plague in Geneva is beginning to rage again and, as I hear, it is affecting mainly the houses of the prominent, yet it spares the heads of the families.</p>
      <p>It is said that two daughters have died in Roseto. The Duke of Savoy will seize this opportunity again to harass them. We receive no certain news about this disease.</p>
      <p>It was written in many letters that Brunhilde, the Frenchwoman, has also died; but this rumor vanished immediately. The Lord knows when and until when. Our Rustius has not yet moved into the city. Yesterday, Andreas Floretus, the minister from Montbéliard, a man of integrity and sincerity, was with us.</p>
      <p>He is hurrying to Geneva and informed us that Sulcer, Jakob Grynaeus, and Bidenbach, the theologian from Tübingen, came to Montbéliard in recent days, but no debate was held; only Sulcer presented to them a certain declaration of the concord between Luther and Bucer. He showed us a copy of this declaration, which contains much more of Brentian leaven than the formula of concord itself; for the ubiquity of the body of Christ is not obscurely asserted in it, yet with strangely twisted and varied words, as is the custom of those dark and changeable men. We would have gladly copied it, but he was in such a hurry that he only took a meal. However, he promised to show it to us on his return. Meanwhile, he affirms that they have achieved nothing; indeed, many of the ministers are hypocrites, but the governor and magistrates favor the truth. I have nothing else to write now. You will learn about our private matters from my brother or my younger son, who may come there.</p>
      <p>Lavallens and Coligny, together with Mr. Gracilis and Merlin, send you many greetings and have given me these letters addressed to Mr. Gwalther, to forward them to you. Greet all friends and brothers.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 12, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
