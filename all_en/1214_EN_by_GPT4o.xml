      <p>Grace and mercy from the Lord. Vergerius has again sent me a bundle of letters, dearest Bullinger, asking that I send them to you as quickly as possible; for they contain certain things necessary to know. To satisfy him, I have made the effort; they were kept with me for only one night. I have sent Johannes Pontasella to Zürich for my daughter and to Basel for Paul, a truly faithful and honest man, who carries out whatever his duty is with exactness and utmost fidelity. I wish to recommend him to you as much as I can. With your help, he will settle accounts with Franz Spitzli and will satisfy each matter.</p>
      <p>If there is a shortage of money, I ask your kindness to satisfy or guarantee on my behalf, but not for more than a few days, namely until the next market days. Nothing new is reported among us. Poverty and the high cost of all things vex us, and not without reason; for indeed we are despisers of the most good God and most negligent of our salvation, and most eager worshippers of carnal desires. We hear dreadful and horrible things about the Saxons and Magdeburgers. I ask that you inform us about these matters. Farewell. From Chur, Rhaetia, March 16.</p>
      <p>Consul Haimius and our Philippus send you many greetings. 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent [man] Master Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
