      <p>Greetings. You most piously advise, my Bullinger, on the long-debated controversy of the oath, which (I fear badly) may result in a scandal even harmful to posterity and bring upon us certain divine indignation. For since the moderation undertaken is so adorned with the pretexts of the wisdom of mediators, which is purely of the flesh and of the world, I fear that they may prevail especially among those for whom human favor is considered more important than divine. However, it is our duty, whatever the outcome of the matter, not to fail in our duty, by which we may rescue even our souls from the association of guilt. We have no news here, except that I have received from Saxony that the Archbishop of Magdeburg, the son of Joachim, Elector of Brandenburg, has amicably settled and composed all controversies with the Senate of Magdeburg, and indeed, as far as religion is concerned, has granted them complete freedom, but has undertaken to reform the churches of his bishopric outside the city according to evangelical truth. The people of Strasbourg, along with other cities of the empire, have not been admitted to the communication of peace conditions, namely those which allow the free restoration of religion to the princes; therefore, they have protested that they do not wish to be bound by the mandate which orders them to persist in a mixture of the gospel with impiety, and have petitioned anew to the king and princes. Nor will the pastors, as far as I understand, fail in their duty, whose efforts I understand will be renewed, and therefore they are to be aided by the constant prayers of all the saints. I hear that the innocence of our Calvin is becoming more and more evident against furious accusations, whence indeed our Bernese at least will be more pacified and more equitable towards their fellow citizens. But farewell in Christ Jesus with your colleagues and the whole family.</p>
      <p>Basel, 19th October in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>My colleagues greet you.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and colleague.</p>
