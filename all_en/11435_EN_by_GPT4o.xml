    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's letter and for the care of Johannes Pontisella, who recently praised the kindness of the provost [Felix Frey?], Bullinger, and everyone else in Chur; hopes that their efforts with the young man will bear fruit. Is pleased that the Reformation and the school are somewhat thriving. Has sent the letter bearer, a pious and learned doctor from Milan [Ortensio Lando?], who asked for a letter of recommendation to Zurich, to Bullinger; he will be able to report accurately about Italy. Greetings. If the rumor circulating in Bern [about a letter from Bucer to Comander], which Luzius Tscharner wrote to his son [Hans Tscharner] in Chur, also reaches the ears of the people in Zurich, he would like the opportunity to comment.</p>

      <p>Grace, peace, and innocence of life from God the Father through Jesus Christ. I had long since received your kind letter, most learned Bullinger; how pleasing and delightful it was, I need not extol with many words, lest I seem an empty flatterer. Nevertheless, I give you the greatest thanks, first for deeming me worthy of your letters and friendly greetings from time to time, and then for the great benefits you bestow upon Johannes Pontisella, the orphan, so that he himself enjoys and rejoices magnificently in you as his patron. Indeed, the young man, when he was recently with me in Chur, could not sufficiently praise and highly regard both the benevolence and kindness of the lord provost and yours, as well as that of everyone. I hope, however, that your efforts and kindness will not be misplaced in the young man, with God providing for the future as He has thus far and protecting him. Although it is not permissible to write and boast of extraordinary things about our affairs, the state of the gospel, and the progress of our studies, we nonetheless proclaim and rejoice in the moderate achievements that have been reached. The bearer of this letter, a doctor of medicine, a citizen of Milan, devoted to piety and a great lover of learned men, desiring to visit Zurich, asked me for a letter to some prominent leader of religion, so that by this means he might gain the opportunity to meet and converse with you. Therefore, it pleased me to send this pious man to you first. You, therefore, should consider my confidence or audacity kindly. I write nothing about Italian affairs; for you will hear more accurately from the lord doctor than from my writings. Farewell, most excellent man. From the court of Rhaetia, 16th of May, in the year 40.</p>
      <p>Give my greetings in my name to Master Leo, Pellican, Megander, and Amian, my dearest lords and brothers.</p>
      <p>A certain rumor is being spread about me in Bern, about which Luzius Tscharner wrote to his son in Chur, concerning the matter of the Eucharist. If anything about this has reached you or is about to reach you, I beg you to let me know quickly, and I will not neglect or omit my apology.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant leader of the church in Zurich, his lord and [am]icable [ob]server.</p>
