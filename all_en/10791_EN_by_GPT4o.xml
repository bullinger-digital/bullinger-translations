    <p xml:id="regest1">As already mentioned [in No. 748], the [First Helvetic] Confession is still being reviewed by the Zurich pastors in the city and countryside, but general approval is expected. Meanwhile, Bucer should advocate for an understanding on the Lutheran side, which some, unlike Bullinger himself, still doubt. Reminds him of the request made to Capito [to mediate a teaching position for a son of Christoph Klauser]. A friendly letter [from Wittenberg] would be very welcome to the people of Zurich. A biographer who wants to do justice to Zwingli must not limit himself to describing the events; however, the unfortunate outcome [of the Second War of Kappel] has led to such a biography being temporarily impossible.</p>

      <p>Regarding our confession, Bucer, venerable and dearest brother, I hear nothing else from the brothers than what I mentioned in previous letters. Meanwhile, the brothers in the city are each considering whether anything should be added or removed, should it ever be published. For I understand that they will add much, but I think they will remove nothing that could hinder concord. Finally, to ensure everything is more stable and certain, we will convene the most learned deans and ministers of the word from the countryside, so that their proper judgment may also be added. And here too, I am optimistic. For all who hear what has been done, rejoice. But to ensure everything is just and certain, we will call a proper assembly and explain to it what has been done and the reasoning behind each decision.</p>
      <p>It will be your task, my brother, to work so that those who stand with Luther are friendly to us. For there are those who miserably fear that Luther and his followers will by no means accept our matters or will interpret them unfavorably, indeed will demand something entirely different. I, on the other hand, supported by your words, promise all things will be fortunate. And indeed, I hope the Lord will mercifully grant us holy concord, than which nothing could happen today more joyful and more desired.</p>
      <p>You will advise Capito to do what I requested.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>If even a single friendly letter were written to us from them, you cannot believe how much it would strengthen the spirits of all our people.</p>
      <p>Biographers should not only write about deeds but also the plans behind the deeds, with what spirit, by what means, with what counsel, and for what benefit anything was done. For when deeds are simply reported, judgment arises from the outcome, and good men are judged bad and imprudent because of bad outcomes. But to write about Zwingli's plans and the purpose of each action is subject to envy, slander, and dangers, and the Zurich council would not allow it. For it would be against public peace, against certain city edicts, and against the hereditary alliance we have with the imperialists. Yet without these, the history will be cold, and posterity will neither love nor admire Zwingli, but judge him a rash and foolish man. To mention how much he excelled in letters is superfluous. His writings declare it. His death cannot be described at this time, for it would increase the pride of enemies and the sorrow of our people. And most undeservedly, most perilously, most truly, he has been so betrayed that no one speaks a word about it. The unfortunate outcome has tarnished everything.</p>
