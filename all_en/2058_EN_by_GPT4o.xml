      <p>Greetings. Since it was not sufficiently clear to me where the Reverend Mr. Vergerius is currently residing, and I thought that you might not only know this there, but also have the convenient means to send to him whatever is needed, I have arranged for two packages, one of letters and the other of some booklets, to be brought to you by Mr. Marius Besucius, who delivered this letter to you, so that you may then forward them from there to Vergerius, wherever he may be. I have no doubt that you will gladly do this out of your respect for him. Farewell, my Mr. Bullinger, and please convey my greetings in the Lord to the reverend fathers and brothers there. Chiavenna, the day before the Kalends of November 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, whatever it may be, Francesco Negri.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
      <p>With one package of booklets.</p>
