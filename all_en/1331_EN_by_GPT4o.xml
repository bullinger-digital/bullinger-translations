      <p>Greetings. A legate sent by the Pope to the Diet of Baden, recently held by the Swiss Confederation, called the prelates to the Council of Trent first through an apostolic brief to the sessions, and then by the voice or announcement of the nuncio (observe the cunning) to the preachers and ministers of the churches, without any mention of any session. However, our most honorable magistrate, upon receiving the written document and the nuncio's message also relayed in letters, carefully had it read in the greater senate, which we call the diacosios, and then unanimously decided to present the document to us, so that after careful examination, we (the ministers, I say) might recommend in writing what seems to be done and offer it to them. This indeed was done quickly; for they ordered haste. Soon after reading the letters, they decided on a diet and now call upon Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen, requesting that they also seek the opinion of their ministers (since it is an ecclesiastical matter) and bring the written document of the legate with them, so that it may be deliberated upon in common, as it seems best for the church and the republic. Therefore, since it is of no small importance for the ministers of the churches to agree beautifully among themselves, and this greatly contributes to the preservation of the churches, what we have responded in concord and offered to our most honorable magistrate, I share with you, brothers, not to prescribe anything to you here, but so that you may not be unaware of our opinion.</p>
      <p>Respond in the Lord with what seems to you to be in the interest of the churches. Here you have only the summary: we have explained each point more fully with the reasons added. Consider this goodwill of mine favorably and farewell to all of you together with the fellow ministers and all the learned, especially the most distinguished men Wissenburg, Borrhaus, and Münster. All the brothers greet you. Zürich, July 8, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
