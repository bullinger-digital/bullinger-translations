      <p>Greetings. Although I am currently too busy with affairs to write to you at length, I did not want to let this messenger, whom I understood to be heading to you, leave without a letter from me to you. In this letter, I at least wanted to remind you that you will hear abundantly from him about our affairs, should there be anything you wish to know; for he has been with us here for a long time, most honorably. He is a diligent and not unlearned man; he has seen the state and order of our churches and schools. In summary, there is among all of us who perform ecclesiastical or scholastic duties, both in doctrine and in morals, harmony and unity of spirit. The schools are progressing most successfully; in the discipline of the church and the morals of the people, we desire many things, and indeed it is necessary for all of us to take greater account of this matter and to press even more insistently those who ought to lend us a helping hand. In this matter, our brother and friend and fellow teacher, Mr. Halle, is working hard, as we are aware, with whom I hope we will soon be able to communicate more familiarly about these matters, in which we do not think your advice and help will be lacking to us.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you and your fellow teachers, whom I wish all the best.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Lausanne, September 4, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Pierre Viret.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Zürich church, brother and venerable fellow teacher.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
