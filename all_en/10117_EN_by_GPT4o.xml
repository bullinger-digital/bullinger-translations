      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your letters have filled me with such great joy that they even brought tears to my eyes as I read them. Before their arrival, the rumors of your death had increased due to the disaster, as we read, near Kappel (a place somewhat known to me from your writings), and then the surrender of your birthplace, and also because Brother Jacob was said to have been seen in Cologne without speaking to me or bringing your writings, which are always most welcome to me, in the usual manner. Therefore, I often complained to my closest friends that you, half of my soul, had taken an untimely death from me. When asked about this by our lord and others who once knew you well, I replied that I could suspect nothing else but that you had been killed for the aforementioned reasons. Now that they hear you are still alive, they earnestly congratulate you. Even before, whenever the conversation turned to the disaster of your people, I often mentioned that in that battle, such men were lost who, if it were possible, would undoubtedly be desired to be redeemed with great sums of money and brought back to life. For this reason, I read the entire commentary of Zwingli on true and false religion more diligently than ever, along with some of your writings, not without intense sorrow, because such a great patron was so miserably slain, to the greatest detriment of all who wish to live piously in Christ. From this, you can infer how unexpectedly, yet gratefully, your writings have been to me. Not only do they fill me with solid joy about your safety and well-being, but you also vividly depicted the disaster and battle of your people as if with a brush. I showed and handed these letters to many learned men to read. To some, I also recounted the occasion, process, and outcome of the battle with the total number of the slain. And I marvel today at the prophecy of that man, whom you mentioned, about the history of the Swiss, which was always suspected of falsehood among us. However, the notary tries to approve it with persuasive words, I think, enticed by sumptuous meals from the priests. Nevertheless, he paid the penalty in Strasbourg for this, I believe, being imprisoned for three days. Let him tell you the reason. Perhaps it will not seem otherwise, asserting that more thousands were killed than you report in decades. But with you, I always had and will have greater faith, even if you do not assert that I can narrate your account as the gospel of God. Moreover, how did six hundred drive away eight thousand in the mountains, through ambushes, and countless other things? Since the places and people are almost unknown, I cannot recount them, but I resisted them as much as I could, taught by your letters according to my capacity and measure. But he himself recounted the matter as almost deplorable, and with little hope remaining, it is necessary to embellish it with false words, always adding that you, a good and sincere man, hold a certain middle ground, favoring neither side too much. However, I objected to those things, which, as I said, did not seem plausible, as much as I could, all the more confidently because another condition and opportunity was offered to send letters to you, a man most friendly to me. For from the recent Frankfurt fair, your writings also reached me with two of your works, which I see publicly available in Cologne shortly after, which never happened with others. For which I give you immortal thanks, praying that "Be strong in virtue, boy, thus you go to the stars." And concerning the opportunity, your speech on the prophetic function will be taken care of by our lord at your command. Furthermore, the little brother reported that a huge sum of money was taken from the Baselers, and your side is held responsible for compensating the damage inflicted on the adversaries, and I don't know how many thousands of ducats are to be paid for sixteen burned houses, also how each city of your side reproaches the other for the occasion and cause of such great evil, and the incredible discord now sown among them, also that you, with your parents and brother, are forced to leave your former residences, and they are now staying with you in Zurich, and countless other things, all of which I consider tedious to recount. If this is so, I ask you not to forget your piety towards your parents and relatives and to strive, as much as possible without offending the divine, for peace and unity. For we think that some ceremonies can be borne more lightly than hatred, rancor, and discord. For the public function of bishop and prophet has been granted to you by divine gift, even if not in the papal rite.</p>
      <p>Among other things, you ask that I respond to these letters in such a way that you feel I have received them and the previous ones. I indeed responded to the previous ones, with which you sent a booklet against the Anabaptists, unaware of whether with the diligence that was due. I also do not know whether I have not responded to any of your letters as intended, which you insert, as the words suggest, accusing me of avarice. For you write after mentioning avarice, as follows: Therefore, keep that enemy of yours in mind, so that you do not leave him unless he is slain. Although you accuse me of this most abominable sin, I am by no means conscious of it by the grace of God. For if I had ever pursued money, a much more convenient path would have been shown long ago, which now, content with the present, I barely eat vegetables from a small dish. Thus, I wish to change my place not for anything else but the tepidity of the gospel, if it could be done appropriately. However, the glory of the gospel will flourish with us shortly, we hope, by the will of divine grace. For it is already budding. Indeed, many common people and learned men among us secretly favor the gospel. But no one dares to break out and openly criticize the vices and abuses due to the tyranny of the princes. The Duke of J端lich also provided a certain example of piety, as you can see in his appended constitutions. Our bishop is also spoken ill of by the priests and monks. For he abolished or rather made free some saints' holidays, so that the poor would not be burdened with so many feast days, and so that sins and crimes, which were usually committed then, would not be multiplied. Nor does he care much for papal bulls, thunderbolts, and excommunications, opposing them by freely conferring ecclesiastical benefices to anyone in turn, even apostolic, as it is said. For recently, the college of St. Kunibert, because by the bishop's order it refused to confer apostolic torches to the one offering possession, was excommunicated by the pope, but the bishop, on the other hand, absolved it. Although these things may seem ridiculous and absurd, as they are indeed trivial, they are nevertheless designated to portend something new. Very recently, even Soest, a wealthy city in Westphalia, expelled the fat ones and admitted those who truly elucidate the scriptures. The same is said to have been attempted in M端nster, another notable city in Westphalia, and likewise in Wesel and some other small towns such as Lippstadt and Hamm, to such an extent that unless the evil demon sows discord, as it was with you, or tyrants exasperate their subjects, all of Westphalia will soon admit the true gospel of God. But oh, if only all would express the same in morals and innocence of life (in your words). There are also some magnates in the land of J端lich who admit the pure gospel, such as the Count of Moers, also some small towns, and so far by the grace of God without dissensions and disaster. May it spread like ivy without scandal and offense to anyone, until we all glorify with one voice our Father who is in heaven. May He grant this to us, "who is blessed forever. Amen" [Romans 1:25].</p>
      <p>Last year, the Emperor amassed an innumerable treasure of money in Brabant. But for what use, who will know? He, accompanied by many, left Cologne for Regensburg on the last days of Carnival to receive the assembly of the princes of Germany there and, as it is said, to await a message concerning the so-called Lutheran affair, for which they seek a response from the imperial legation in Schweinfurt in eastern France, the Archbishop of Mainz, the Count Palatine, along with some others. However, as we have been told from a letter sent by one of our consuls to his wife from Regensburg, the assembly may perhaps be frustrated, because, as it is said, the princes of Germany do not want to obey the Emperor in all things, who strives with the utmost effort to restore the pope's arrogance. It is also said that Rome was again attacked by Spanish and other mercenary soldiers for unpaid wages for the siege of Florence, and they inflicted great damage on the cardinals, and the pope himself barely escaped their furious hands into the Castel Sant'Angelo, which they now besiege with the Roman citizens permitting it and pleading that this evil be removed from them as innocents.</p>
      <p>These are the things, my Heinrich, that I did not want to keep from you. Farewell and love me in return, and bid all our mutual friends to greet them in my name.</p>
      <p>Given in Cologne, the sixteenth of April, in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Theodericus Bitter von Wipperf端rth.</p>
