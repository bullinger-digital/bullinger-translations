      <p>Greetings through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Esteemed and gracious Lord Bullinger, I offer you my willing service. I would be very pleased to hear that you are in good health. As for myself, I give thanks and praise to God the Lord for continuing to share His grace with us. After I wrote to you before my departure to Paris and Lyon during the Easter fair, intending to ride out to visit you at home, which I was indeed willing to do. And as I was traveling from Lyon after Pentecost, I received a letter on the way informing me that my late father-in-law, Hieronymus Paumgartner's wife, had passed away in God. Therefore, I was to arrange some matters immediately; this is the reason I did not visit you this time, but it can still happen soon. I did not want to neglect maintaining the old friendship, so I seek you at home with this little letter, recounting what has happened to me since my arrival here. Namely, after I had previously conferred with our scholars and preachers on the articles of our Christian faith and sacraments, bringing some to fruitful understanding, they asked me to bring them some works by J. Calvin, which I did, and also shared your books, which they recognized as a great treasure. However, in the end, I was accused by a preacher named Johannes Schelhamer at St. Lorenz of being a sacramentarian and blasphemer, so much so that he publicly proclaimed it in his sermon on Sunday, August 4th. After hearing that I was being talked about, I went to him with two honorable persons, addressing him about whether he meant me, which he admitted, and if I did not desist from this blasphemy, he would examine me as well as the Schwenckfelders (some of whom have been banned from the city here). To which I immediately replied that I did not know what Schwenckfelders were, I for my part am a Christian and baptized in Christ, and am always ready and willing to make a confession and acknowledgment of my faith, but protesting that I would not accept or recognize him as a judge or arbiter, with the agreement that I would have two learned men on my side, and he should also take two on his side to present my confession to them, so they could convince me from the foundation of divine scripture to follow them. I have therefore especially relied on you and your church to assist in such a Christian work, and if it should still be necessary, I am entirely willing to come to you and seek your counsel. But the matter has for now been settled: since I was entirely willing to petition an honorable council here, as I hereby enclose a copy of it, to make amends for my tarnished honor, some honorable people have taken up the matter and arranged it in such a way that he made a proper apology to me in the presence of respectable people, and thus the matter has been settled for now. And this handling has greatly displeased some of our preachers and church servants, especially Mr. Mauritz Helling, preacher at St. Sebald's parish, and Mr. Linhart Krieg, both God-fearing men who have also often spoken well of you in all good things, to whom I have also shared your books, which they greatly appreciated. I would therefore ask you, if it is convenient for you, to write to them out of Christian love, as faithful pastors overseeing the churches here; I hope such a Christian work will bring no small fruit. For if the churches here were reformed, it would have great significance throughout all of Germany. I could not refrain from complaining to you about my distress, therefore I ask you to take it in good part. Regarding recent news here, it is said that His Imperial Majesty will move to Vienna on the 12th of this month in person and inspect the Turks; they are said to be up to 300,000 strong, and on our side, 30,000 cavalry and about 40,000 infantry are to gather in total. There is no news yet that anything significant has been accomplished, except as you have undoubtedly heard before, that two fortresses, Dottis and Uessprin, have been taken; whatever else I learn, I will inform you at the first opportunity. May Almighty God be gracious and merciful to us and turn His wrath away from us, which He will undoubtedly do if we abstain from sin; otherwise, nothing more for now than that I commend myself to your prayers, and if it is convenient for you, write me a reply. With that, I commend you to God. Dated in Nuremberg, August 17, 1566.</p>
      <p>Your willing Gabriel Schl√ºsselberger. To the honorable and highly learned Heinrich Bullinger, my especially gracious lord and good friend in Zurich.</p>
