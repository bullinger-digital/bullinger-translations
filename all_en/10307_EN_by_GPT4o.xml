    <p xml:id="regest1">In view of the Catholic opponents, diligence and perseverance are necessary. Fortunately, the enemies, through their disunity and greed for money, benefit the Evangelicals more than they harm them. Some take very badly the Zurichers' stance against foreign alliances at the Diet; however, the argument that one should ally with France because it is an opponent of the Pope is foolish. News of the marriage of Catherine de' Medici, the Pope's niece, to Henry, the son of Francis I, and of the Emperor's resistance to the Pope's journey to France. Allusion to a secret message from Myconius to Karlstadt. Remarks from two Catholic sailors in Basel about the inevitability of a war against the reformed places. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I commend your usual diligence, dearest Bullinger, as it is most necessary in these times, not doubting that if constancy is added, then consensus among the proclaimers of the word will lead everything to a happy end by God, especially with adversaries such as you have indicated. I give thanks to the most good and great God that such worthless men openly place themselves in the opposing ranks. Do they not help us more than harm us? It seems to me that this is done by the singular counsel of God. However, it pains me that you write that the word is received more coldly there. For there has been no doubt about the care of private matters until now. Nevertheless, if you remain constant, as I said, you will break through. I am also glad, if one can rejoice over evils, that those of Immontan live so impiously, fostering discord for the sake of gold. Who knows whether perhaps our God will use this impiety in the future for the advancement of His word? You advise them to desist from the alliances of princes, but they do not obey. I hear indeed that some prefer this, so that if you take the opportunity, you may better consult for us and for all of us. It has grieved some not a little that at the recent Diet, these alliances were reproached by your people. For they feared that it would prevent what would benefit us. It is foolish for some to try to persuade you with this argument to make an alliance with the French, because it would be against the Pope.</p>
      <p>It is known among us that the Pope will give his niece in marriage to the son of the king, that she is now in France, and that the Pope is expected by the king, with several cardinals and some nobles sent to bring him to Rome. Certainly strange: Here they disagree, there they make alliances! Although we also know that the Emperor has sent someone to prevent him from leaving Rome, under threat of losing his favor. We do not know, however, what will be accomplished.</p>
      <p>What I entrusted to Karlstadt should remain secret. I wanted you to know it, however, not for any other reason than if in some way through diligent observation this matter could be understood. You hope nothing of the sort will happen. So be it. But is it not true: If they could, they would do even more atrocious things? Let the eyes of those consulting always be intent on this, unless they prefer to be deceived in the future.</p>
      <p>Two local sailors said openly here among the citizens a few days ago: "The Bernese, whatever we do, always hinder us and set themselves against us. And so, by my hot wounds, it cannot be endured, we must still butt heads with you; we must be of one faith and make one part drive out the other," etc. Do you hear this? May God grant us His grace and use His usual mercy with us. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily with yours and with Leo.</p>
      <p>Basel, October 22, 1533.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius, always yours.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, a very learned man, his most dear lord and brother.</p>
