    <p xml:id="regest1">In Bourges, the study of law is flourishing, but it does not seem to align with the views of the people of Zurich. Additionally, the cost of living is high. Fries is completely undecided about the path to take in this situation, which is why he has not yet written. Geßner has accepted the offer to teach the children of Melchior Volmar. Request for the remittance of the remaining amount of the scholarship.</p>

      <p>Greetings. If we could boast about the Bourges muses being as safe as we are, it would indeed be well and truly in accordance with our wishes, but the gods do not grant all things to men at once. The study of civil law is flourishing here, which, as we are not at all eager for it, does not seem to align with your views either. Furthermore, what is commonly called a "table" here costs no less than a hundred francs, similarly in Paris, where there was such a crowd of people that, among other things, it was not even possible to find a place suitable for studies. We live as we can, since we cannot live as we wish. What, I ask, should have been done about Gaul? Or what about this stipend in Gaul? Fries is still uncertain and undecided. Therefore, you will excuse him for writing less. A certain opportunity presented itself to me to teach the children of Mr. Melchior, a Greek professor here. What, I ask, should I do? Or where should I turn? I accepted, although there was little room left for studies here, yet on the condition that if it seemed otherwise to your excellency, I would not be bound to this duty. Therefore, we entrust what more should be done to your prudence and fairness. If it is to remain anywhere in Gaul, send the remaining sum of this year's scholarship immediately with the first messenger. For couriers are rarely found, especially here. Certainly, if we had not been a laughingstock to you or others, Gaul would have been left to us after these experiences, truly golden and where nothing is accomplished without gold.</p>
      <p>O both protection and sweet honor, farewell and diligently pursue our cause.</p>
      <p>Given in Bourges, April 14.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, C. Geßner.</p>
