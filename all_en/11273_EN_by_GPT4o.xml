    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks in the name of his clients for the response [No. 1227], which is, however, disappointing, as the transmission of confidential news remains risky in the absence of a Secret Council; the Basel delegates will nevertheless present some matters for consultation to the Zurichers at the Baden Diet. The threat of war is evident as soon as the Frankfurt Diet concludes, as demonstrated by the recruitment and mustering of the opponents; the jeopardy to other Protestant states cannot be indifferent to the Confederates. Rudolf [Gwalther] has returned to him. Frau von Grynaeus [Katharina Lompart] is feeling better again.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I give thanks, my dear Bullinger, to you and yours, for so promptly and clearly dispatching what we requested. Although the response was not given according to our wishes, it has nonetheless satisfied the minds that had some hope for a better outcome, so that now they know nothing is to be hoped for. It pained me immediately after the war, when I heard that the council of secret affairs (so to speak), which, while it is honest, cannot but be most useful and is still held not without great benefit in great republics, was abolished. For I foresaw what evils would arise from this, especially as long as the Five Cantons would not cease to be enemies.</p>
      <p>Is it not indeed a great evil that we do not dare to reveal secrets to yours without great inconvenience - because of the common enemy - to ours?</p>
      <p>And yet, while we remain silent, it may happen that the inconvenience becomes more serious. If the plans of the papists proceed, you will understand at some point what is now more obscure.</p>
      <p>I have told my people what you wrote; what they have decided, I do not know. There is no doubt, however, that they have given some mandate to the delegates, which is to be discussed with yours on more serious matters at the Baden Diet.</p>
      <p>The princes and cities of the Evangelical League have again convened in Frankfurt. There is no one who does not fear war after that Diet is dissolved. Thus, one of the lecturers from Strasbourg wrote yesterday: “We know (this to you in confidence) that your neighbors are being solicited into the league of adversaries by the followers of Ferdinand and the papists.” What is intended, God knows. Indeed, what my mind forebodes, I currently conceal, not because I do not dare to pronounce it to you, but because I know you feel the same as I do, even if I conceal it.</p>
      <p>The nobility throughout Swabia is likewise being sought, not without the greatest terror of the Swabian cities. From our neighbors, selections are being made, but for what purpose is unknown. Meanwhile, we sit as if all were most peaceful, when nothing could be more certain than that all impious consultations are against us alone. No one cares for the Helvetic gospel; but if the princes, cities, kingdoms that diligently foster the word of Christ were destroyed (which the Lord avert), who does not know what would become of us? These perplexed writings from a perplexed mind, I ask you to consider kindly.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily in the Lord with yours.</p>
      <p>Your Rudolf has returned to me. Grynaeus's wife is beginning to recover. Basel, February 23, in the year 39.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, chief bishop of the Zurichers, his venerable brother and lord in Christ.</p>
