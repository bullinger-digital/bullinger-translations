      <p>Greetings. Yesterday, after enduring long and indeed deadly illnesses for almost ten full months, I arrived at the Baden Baths, not by a direct route, but after first visiting Basel. I traveled here with my son Jonas as my companion, who now, no less than I, is compelled by necessity to bathe in the baths.</p>
      <p>How the affairs of the empire and my own are going cannot be explained in a few words. However, if you think it is in the interest of your republic to know these things promptly, it can be done through a faithful messenger who will call on me with at least your testimonials; then I will not delay in fully explaining to him those things that may concern you.</p>
      <p>I am miserably tossed about and wander from place to place without a certain home, having no other consolation than what the scripture promises with this word: Whom God loves, He chastises, etc.</p>
      <p>I have brought my son Jonas, now in his 16th year, here with me, setting aside other considerations, to make him a student of the Zurich school, not caring that he was previously dedicated to other academies; for the supreme academy of the Swiss seems to me to be a gathering of the pious and learned.</p>
      <p>In Baden, I am staying with a host near the later baths with some people from Zurich, among whom, God willing, I will be found for fourteen days. I hope to come to you; in the meantime, I ask you to look after a teacher and a frugal host for my son, and if your duties allow, write back a word or two. Farewell and greet the lords, brothers, and councilors, Mr. Lavater and Mr. Habius, most diligently in my name. Hastily from the Baden Baths, April 20th, in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Georg Fr√∂lich from Lomnitz.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned and pious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed leader of the Christian community in Zurich, my gracious lord, to be delivered. Zurich.</p>
