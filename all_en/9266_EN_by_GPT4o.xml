      <p>S. The 10 factions, which were positioned outside the city, withdrew yesterday and have set up a court among themselves in Thusis in the Upper League, consisting of 33 judges, one from each major court, and to these 33 judges, they have assigned as many armed men as needed to reach 600, and they were supposed to be at the inn this Thursday. However, today it has been decided that it will be announced again to all the communities whether they want to let it proceed in this manner and punish with force or law; because apart from those 10 factions or courts, many messengers have now been dispatched from their communities, who are indeed willing to punish the guilty, but in an orderly manner and not with armed force.</p>
      <p>Therefore, these want the factions' people or messengers to come to them in the city on appointed days and to punish them orderly. So these want those in the city, as representatives from their communities, to come to them in the Quarters under the open sky and set up a common impartial court with them, which those in the city do not want to do, therefore those outside the city have proceeded and set up a law (as mentioned above) according to their will. Now the others think they have more and not the factions.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is being announced again to the communities, and next Sunday the majority should be gathered here, namely Tschiertschen, Luven, Waltensburg, Obersaxen, Flims, Laax, Schluein, Rheinwald, Heinzenberg, the entire Mesolcina Valley, Chur, Upper and Lower Engadin, Val Müstair, 4 villages, Bergün, Ramosch; in 10 courts, Davos is also not eager to proceed so forcefully. To this, it would become the majority to proceed orderly, not forcefully. But I fear internal slaughter.</p>
      <p>Farewell. 1573, last day of March.</p>
      <p>Yours truly.</p>
