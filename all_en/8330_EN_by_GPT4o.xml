      <p>Your letters were of the greatest consolation to me, most reverend father, and unless I were to give you eternal thanks, I see very easily that I would be remarkably ungrateful. Therefore, I give eternal thanks now only in words, wishing that I could do so in deeds someday. If I had known what subject that man from Prättigau had dealt with, I would have dissuaded him, as I have done with many others who wanted to increase the burdens of your college and church. But believe me, all these things happen without my knowledge; however, they are not ashamed to overstep the bounds of modesty, who, being very greedy, have learned to think only of what is useful to themselves, not what is burdensome to others. Truly remarkable gratitude in these men, who envy us our stipends, yet are not ashamed to impose their own on others, indeed to cause trouble to those from whom they beg for the pastors of their souls.</p>
      <p>If our Katharina were still alive, I would wish to join my letters with yours and send them to Transylvania, to Debrecen. Our people depict the present state of France quite differently. For the rumor has spread that a battle has taken place, in which the hero Strozza was captured, and in return, 4000 of the Admiral's cavalry were killed. I am accustomed to eagerly hunt for Italian affairs for your sake, as much as my very persistent illness allows, but I can draw nothing certain and solid from the Italian colleagues; therefore, I have turned somewhat to the papists for this matter, and especially to the provost of the episcopal court, an Italian man, eloquent and learned, and therefore sent here by the pope. He usually takes a walk in the morning and evening and returns outside the gate by the same route I usually take, so that he often meets me and is asked if he has any news from Italy. Very kindly, he often converses with me for 2 hours, and this very evening he candidly shared with me from such letters, which he recently received from Venice: The Turk is stuck in Negroponte with 160 galleys, while Cyprus is guarded by a Venetian naval force of 400 ships, and many ships sent by the Spaniard, which others say are being recalled; however, the strength of the Venetians is advancing both by sea and by land to the number of 100,000. The people of Ragusa, out of fear of the impending Turk, have all fled from their homes, but the Venetians have looked out for another suitable place for them. On the fifteenth day of June, the generals of the Venetians, as they call them, decided to make an attack on the Turk with all their might and to try everything; but the Turk did not want to stand and commit himself to battle. The Venetians now hold the whole of Morea, which has so far recognized only the Turk from the confederation. In it, most of the mountains are tuffaceous and are being cut and dug by 10,000 stonecutters to lead in the channel of the sea, so that the following enemy may be more easily overwhelmed and hindered. The Turkish envoy is still being held in chains by the Venetians, just as the Venetian envoy is by the Turks; it is necessary that a conflict takes place immediately or that they both withdraw with the matter unfinished; for the Getae cannot remain at sea any longer than until the middle of September. This he said; shortly, when he has obtained more. At the same time, I finally return this Polish writing of yours and give my greatest thanks to your reverence.</p>
      <p>The brothers marvel at such success amidst the many tricks and stratagems of the papists. The Lord will add increase more and more every day for the advancement of His glory and our salvation.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man and necessary and shining light. May the Lord Jesus, who sees your holy labors, strengthen you most effectively with His spirit for the celebration of His name and the consolation and instruction of us all. Amen.</p>
      <p>Mr. Brunner will exchange Maienfeld with a certain village in Thurgau under Ulm's Wöllenberg. It is said that he was almost starved among the Maienfeld drivers; he only complains about the inhumanity of these people; therefore, he will leave at Martin's festival. Marius is plotting for that position, who has so far managed the school in Winterthur. I wonder why he has returned to Rhaetia again, when he could have lived more happily elsewhere. I fear that this difficult man will cause us much strife and discord; for he has a remarkable head and mind. But why do I not cease to trouble you?</p>
      <p>Chur, July 24, 1570.</p>
      <p>Mr. Consul, Mr. Pontisella, and all the rest greet you. Mr. Carlius has been elected prefect of Maienfeld for the next year, etc. Forgive me, I pray; for I wrote this by lamplight and did not reread it.</p>
      <p>What, I ask, has happened to the Duchess of Württemberg? There is a difficult and disgraceful rumor among us, which we must fear will not become the occasion of greater evil, etc. Will there be a diet in Baden and your synod for this reason?</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church of Zurich, his singularly esteemed lord, with the greatest respect.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and highly learned pastor at the Great Minster in Zurich.</p>
