    <p xml:id="regest1">His inquiries at Blarer's request [No. 756] have revealed that the canons demanded the due interest from Zurich based on a decision by the 10 locations - which, however, is only valid for Thurgau; they were referred to legal proceedings because the city of Constance also claims the interest. He has sensed much goodwill towards Constance, so it will certainly get its rights. He will inform what he learns further. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Friendly, dear sir and brother, as I inquired about your matter at your request, which you last wrote to me about, I have begun to investigate and have learned that you do not need to fear the priests (the canons), as the matter is arranged in such a way that they will have to accept you (concern you). It is as follows: On the 4th of March, the priests demanded the overdue interest from my lord mayor, asking him to allow them to collect it. They primarily base their claim on the judgment obtained from the 10 locations regarding the properties located in Thurgau, assuming that the same judgment should also apply among the locations, etc. However, their steward was answered that the interest would not be released to anyone without legal proceedings. And since the city of Constance claims the interest, the priests should set a date, so that both parties can be heard and dealt with according to what is appropriate. That is the current situation.</p>
      <p>In this, I have noticed great favor towards the city of Constance, so that if any justification and right are found, you will receive what you desire. Furthermore, I have observed that they will achieve little or nothing with the judgment of the 10 locations in my lord's territory. The good gentlemen assume that Zurich is not yet a bailiwick, so the bailiwick judgments do not compel them, etc.</p>
      <p>I let you know this in good faith at your request, and whatever else I learn, you shall also hear.</p>
      <p>God be with you. Greet Doctor Hans, young lord Conrad, and other dear gentlemen and brothers for me.</p>
      <p>6th of March, 1536.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, pious, and wise Thomas Blarer, of the council in Constance, his dear lord.</p>
