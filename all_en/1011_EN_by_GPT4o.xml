      <p>The grace of God be with us all, etc. Know, dear brother, that my condition is as always, though with less pain, yet still enough. The hole is still equally deep; I fear it may collapse more; it festers and swells again greatly, and it stinks badly, so that I cannot bear it.</p>
      <p>Still on the stick, but not further than the house and the church, which I attend with great pain. But God gives grace and strength; in this will I live, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my brother, I fear that I will not be able to fulfill my office in the autumn, which grieves me from your side, and also mine, from the heart, and I must stay at home, I will have a long time. But if it is possible, I will come; if not, ask Josias, whom I will reward, or Heini Widerker, who has offered himself; whoever does it, I will be satisfied; for it is not to your detriment for your business.</p>
      <p>I am wasting away in body and goods with pain. I have become acquainted with St. Fridli. When I come, the children will fear me; for there is nothing but skin and bone on me. Yet I am healthy in head and heart; but I cannot eat, except that the good wine sustains me. Therefore, I thank everyone from whom I have received it. The mother Bleickeren will faithfully pray to God for them. Gen sumi gen summ etc. Farewell, brother, with your family. Last of August.</p>
      <p>That I have not written to you about everything is not without reason, I did not want to trouble you. Know that it is indeed rough with me. On Sunday during the sermon, the real treasure of clotted blood and pus broke open. I have little rest, day and night it runs greatly, I am of good cheer to joke and sing; the secret suffering with it, as soon as I reveal it. Therefore, my dear brother, assure yourself in the autumn, as you can; for I am not to be a church servant or harvester.</p>
      <p>I stink like an otter, I could well use my own shaving and washing. If they gave me the Senckhoff for my own, it would not be possible for me now. On Sunday I have the good fortune. God improve it. But nevertheless, write to me, if they want to lament. If I can, then I can.</p>
      <p>I have not yet received anything from Piedmont. Michel has offered me, if he can, as he is planning a ride out in the autumn to arrange his affairs.</p>
      <p>The Picard soldiers are dying greatly, especially the Urners. I send you (meaning you) a quarter of the best nuts I have; do as all village priests; it is Glauci et Diomedis permutatis.</p>
      <p>God be with you all; may He grant a joyful autumn and fruit with God, health, and honor to use. Amen.</p>
      <p>Remember the poor Etter Hansen, who was also once of good cheer and found himself very well. Now well, the Lord will have me so; may His will be done. Again, farewell with yours yesterday at the 7th hour of the night. Write back, if you have time.</p>
      <p>Johannes, yours.</p>
      <p>I will send Sara to the church fair; she will tell my business.</p>
      <p>To his dear brother Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
