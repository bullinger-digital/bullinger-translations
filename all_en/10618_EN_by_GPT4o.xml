      <p>Greetings. I was not worthy for any of your people from Zofingen to meet me, as I had gone there at great risk to my health for the sake of renewing our friendship, and since that time, I have not been worthy to receive even a single letter from you. If I knew this was due to my fault, it would certainly cause me the greatest pain, but since I am well aware of my conscience regarding both of you, I am forced to bear both the absence and the silence indifferently and to endure my labors in my corner.</p>
      <p>Franz can no longer perform his duties due to a large goiter, so we will need another assistant. For this reason, when your advice was needed, I could neither share my own nor request yours, unless it entirely slipped my mind, which, due to the neglected opportunity, I could not fulfill my wishes towards you especially.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, on the very day of Ascension, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your Bert. H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
