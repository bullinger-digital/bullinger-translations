      <p>Shake off the sorrow, my brother, that I have spent so much expense, because I sent a messenger to your kindness; for I made an exchange, of which I will never regret. Certainly, the exchange of Diomedes and Glaucus was whatever I expended. I gave silver, not gold nor Corinthian bronze, but I received divine things, which I can never repay, namely the commentaries on Mark, Luke, the Acts of the Apostles, and the Series of Times with 4 books Against the Catabaptists. Now I send back the gold through Johannes the Scholastic, the shoemaker from Zürich, who washed in the bitter fountain, so that you can satisfy Froscho - truly; what remains, you will give to your wife in my name as a token of remembrance.</p>
      <p>The four calendars of December holding the precepts or words in the margin, with which he wrapped the books, are very pleasing. For the sake of brevity, we once comprehended them in this distich: One, idol, swore, on holy Sabbath, Ah father, murderer, adulterer, thief, witness, and wishes.</p>
      <p>I am grateful that you ran up and down for our sake, and I will repay you whenever the opportunity presents itself.</p>
      <p>Who sent you arguments or rather sophisms, I cannot divine. In political and ecclesiastical matters, I see our clamorous declaimers equally pressing, it is not fitting to call these Proteus and Euripus. Now we are concerned with hiding books, not buying them; everything with us is so turned into the street. On the eighth day of July, a rumor came to us that the Count of Beirren (under whose power two years ago there were 30,000 foot soldiers) will soon bring many horsemen, who for some time have shown themselves among us as insatiable vessels and vigorous drinkers and epicureans. What the head without a tongue and the frog of Seriphos croaks or, as I might say with Aristophanes, frets, you know. Recently, four hundred citizens of Württemberg sought Moravia and Austria; many will follow them in these days, unless they cannot obtain the opportunity to change their place in Stuttgart. The Lerna and Camarina of evils, indeed the burden of Babylon in the cities here and there, boils and rages so much over the mass not being said, that he seems not to have sung badly to me in this verse: The mother and nurse of all evils is the mass.</p>
      <p>Well did Nestor say in the comedy: "O foolish people, how you are always intent on the outward appearance," and Ludovicus Vives in "On the Truth of the Christian Faith" book 2, chapter 13: "The demon also wants the mass or masses to be recited." Domitius Calderinus did not even want to hear the mass, and when he was led there by friends, he is said to have remarked: "Let us go to the common error."</p>
      <p>Therefore, those verses are to be embraced in our times: Now it is enough, we must make the mass dismissed, So that the thing may now have its own name.</p>
      <p>The mass indeed is called so many times, but it is not yet done; There is no need to say, unless it is also done.</p>
      <p>About the Interim book, a muse and atheist, fabricated for the destruction of the gospel, I prefer to remain silent rather than say little. It is tedious to remember this lamentable burden, I say the unclean world so bewitched by the devil, that it clings more willingly to lies than to truth, to gain rather than to piety.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me, as you do.</p>
      <p>Heiningen, 10th day of July, in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>Joachim Aberlin.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the people of Zürich.</p>
