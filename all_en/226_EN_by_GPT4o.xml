      <p>S. in domino. Many nobles are fleeing from Strasbourg with their possessions; they either fear the power of the Emperor or are inclined towards treachery. I would detain and confine them until all matters with the Emperor are settled and brought to a favorable conclusion.</p>
      <p>In Freiburg, they are preparing for foreign guests. In Breisach, there was a legal proceeding today in the afternoon. About 12 Italian cavalrymen have arrived there, some in velvet jackets, and they demand in the name of His Imperial Majesty to have a base there, wanting to occupy the small town and also to station soldiers from the land there. There is a strange practice going on; they have ridden around the small town, inspecting it in all places. May God help His own.</p>
      <p>Thus, the Emperor wants to block the way from Strasbourg so that no soldiers can come to them, or to vex us, which I believe more, since the one from Pforzheim is preparing, gathering many people on horseback and on foot. The cannons are in Speyer.</p>
      <p>What do you think, if the Emperor moves against Savoy, will he trouble us in Basel, in Constance, and attack the Bernese?</p>
      <p>The situation is complex.</p>
      <p>You know well how miserably things stand in Augsburg, the council has been deposed, the guilds abolished.</p>
      <p>Those from Strasbourg are skillful, they are sufficiently warned, if they are willing otherwise. I am informed that some are leaving the city, like Besserer, who made peace with the Emperor. Some of the nobility are also withdrawing; meanwhile, some are moving into the city, pious people. They have secretly hired soldiers, but they need many more. Mr. Schertlin and Heidecker have sufficiently warned them, also offering their advice and help. One must pray to God for help, counsel, and wisdom. Amen.</p>
      <p>On the 13th of August.</p>
      <p>Yours as always.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich, etc. In Zürich.</p>
