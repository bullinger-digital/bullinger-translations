      <p>To the most excellent man in piety and doctrine, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church in Zürich, I pray for the grace of God the Father in Christ Jesus, the author of salvation and the only high priest of the faithful. Indeed, there are many matters, distinguished pastor, both private and public, about which I ought to write to your piety. But since the opportunity of time does not allow me to cover all these with the pen, I have decided to write only a few things that are most important for you to know about the state of our churches scattered in the most calamitous kingdom of Hungary. Know, therefore, that the church, purchased with the blood of Christ, has been suffering among us for many years under a harsh and indeed miserable servitude, so that anyone who contemplates its sorrowful appearance must have a heart of iron if he can contain his groans and tears. For the Turk, who holds our metropolis Buda occupied for a long time, continues to devastate and plunder the remaining parts of the entire kingdom without any resistance or helping hands being extended. A huge multitude of virgins, children, wives, etc., are driven away like cattle into a vile and perpetually lamentable servitude.</p>
      <p>There you can see the excessively unfortunate parents with what bitterness of soul they are separated and deprived of their sweetest children, never to see them again, and sold into various parts of the world. Likewise, the most chaste virgins and matrons, in the division of the spoils, fall to the lot of the most savage and cruel soldiers. In the slave market, called haracz in their Turkish language, they are bound with iron chains or ropes around their necks and paraded in groups for sale. The buyers examine their mouths, teeth, and all their joints and limbs, to see if there is any defect in their whole body, before they buy them. All these things (besides the fact that many captives are slaughtered like cattle without any compassion) are not only horrible to behold but also truly miserable to hear with pious ears. But we are not immune from domestic evils either.</p>
      <p>For besides the fact that everything here is in turmoil due to wars, the Roman antichrist rages so much against the sound doctrine of the gospel and the faithful ministers of the word, especially in those places not yet entirely occupied by Turkish madness, that he has deprived all cities, towns, and villages of their church ministers and pastors. And no minister of the church can escape their dire persecution anywhere unless he has taken refuge under Turkish rule. For the Turk, among those whom he already possesses under his dominion, favors the sincere ministers of the gospel to such an extent and treats them with such humanity (and it is undoubtedly done by divine intervention) that he never harasses them with any hindrance, unless the ecclesiastical men themselves invite one of them to a banquet or receive them into their homes on some other occasion. Indeed, it often happens that the Turks themselves, in groups, attend the ecclesiastical assembly when a sermon is given to the Christian people; but as soon as the holy communion begins to be celebrated, they leave. In that persecution, which those bloody bishops exercise against the elect of God, it may not be inappropriate to inform you briefly of what has happened in our vicinity these days. Nicolaus Valachus, archbishop of our metropolitan church of Esztergom (though the Turk now has his vicar there), otherwise the chief chancellor of King Ferdinand of the Romans to Hungary, had imprisoned three church ministers in Pozsony. Two of them publicly recanted the pious doctrine of the Lord Jesus from the pulpit and were released, while the third persevered in the confession of the truth, but it is now unknown where he has ended up from prison. One of those who renounced the doctrine of Christ, as soon as he returned home and wanted to celebrate his marriage with a certain honest virgin betrothed to him before his denial, began to fall ill with anxiety of conscience and, for a whole week before he miserably breathed his last, he became mute; the other, as if out of his mind, still wanders foolishly here and there through towns and villages.</p>
      <p>I wanted to describe these things especially so that your church may be diligent in its constant prayers to mitigate God's vengeance and more fervently obtain a happier state for the true church. It remains now that I write to you for the sake of consultation about certain ambiguities.</p>
      <p>It often happens in our regions that legitimate spouses are torn apart by the violent hands of marauding barbarians, so that the husband, with his wife taken away, escapes the hostile hands and can never thereafter, even at the cost of all his goods, either know where his abducted wife is or redeem her. Meanwhile, the same husband, unable to be without a wife for a long time while managing the household affairs, and compelled by the weakness of the flesh to avoid falling and the bonds of Satan, takes a second wife and lives with her for so long that he even has children by her. However, over time, by divine mercy, it happens that the former wives of such husbands are freed from the hands of the tyrants and return home, where various matrimonial disputes finally arise. For many husbands prefer and receive the former wife, who was taken into captivity, while many reject her, as she has experienced many defilements among the impious, with God as the avenger, or because such husbands have begotten children from their later wives and pursue them with greater love, while they neither loved the former wives so much nor begot children from them. Moreover, if the matrons taken into captivity do not have the hope of being restored to their former marital status, they perhaps prefer to endure that abominable servitude until the end of their lives rather than strive to return to their own with their disgrace. And we indeed know the papal law in this case; however, it does not pacify our minds in these perplexities, and since the church of Christ does not at all admit bigamy, we are sometimes troubled here with a doubtful and perplexing judgment. Therefore, you would do a most pleasing thing for our churches if, having convened a synod of churchmen in the crown of more experienced theologians among you, you would decide something certain on this matter, so that we may avoid scandal in the church of Christ. We entrust this, however, to your diligence; for we trust that you will willingly do all things that befit a faithful disciple and steward of Christ for the safety of sincere religion.</p>
      <p>But the matter itself requires that I also remind you of the rites of our churches, which are laboring everywhere; for anyone can easily conjecture what law each person uses in such a collapsed republic. Thus, among us, each one does what seems good to him in the ecclesiastical ministry, and although the confession of truth and the doctrine of almost all churches in Hungary are the same, wherever that Roman servitude is now extinct (for they greatly imitate your writings and those of Mr. Johannes Calvin), yet the disparity of rites in administering the sacraments and ecclesiastical ceremonies seems to greatly diminish the authority of the ministry among the people and brings the greatest tedium to the unlearned. Therefore, we would earnestly desire, for the sake of unity and agreement of the churches, that you would send us the rite of your entire ecclesiastical function, such as chants, public prayers, the holy supper, baptism, confirmation of marriage, and catechesis, in forms given and printed in Latin by the work of some pious man, to raise and strengthen our churches; for it would happen, since everyone here uniquely embraces your writings, that no one would imitate his own inventions ignorantly and disturb the unity of the churches with diverse rites. You would do well if you also encouraged Mr. Philipp Melanchthon to finally openly express and publish his opinion on the sacrament of the Eucharist; for his dissimulation has hitherto brought no small danger to the church of Christ. Other things that should be written by me to your piety, Heinrich Bullinger the Younger, your son, an adolescent of excellent character, will report to you in my name. Whatever your charity responds to us, let it send its writings to Raphael Hofhalter, the Viennese printer; for he will deliver them to us. The brothers of our churches, whose necessity desires your unceasing prayers to God, greet you. Farewell happily and forgive the barbarous and uncultivated style of the letter.</p>
      <p>Given in Vienna, Austria, on October 26, 1557.</p>
