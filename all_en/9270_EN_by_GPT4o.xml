      <p>Greetings and best wishes. I received your letter, most illustrious man and father in the Lord, highly esteemed, dated March 27th, the day after it was sent, along with your letters written to Bellieverius, which I now return as you requested. With what great joy I received those letters and with what eagerness and delight of my spirit I read them, words cannot express. If only they were in the hands of all the pious and even the impious...</p>
