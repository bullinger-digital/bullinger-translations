    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich feels honored by Bullinger through the recent sending of the [not received] letter and the [“True Confession”] of the Zurichers. - He has made an effort to obtain an opinion from a learned Swiss theologian [Myconius?] about the [“True Confession” or the “Orthodox Confession of the Church of Zurich”]; to Frölich's astonishment, this theologian thought it would have been better if the Zurichers had remained silent. Bullinger should keep this information to himself. Frölich writes this so that Bullinger knows that he also has slanderers in the neighborhood. - The main reason for Frölich's writing is that although Augsburg's churches are well attended, there is a lack of church ministers. Some of them are too inclined towards Lutheranism, and Frölich fears a new schism. Therefore, he asks Bullinger to send a righteous, learned [Zurich preacher to Augsburg], and this should be done as quietly as possible until negotiations about his office have taken place in [Augsburg]. The people of Augsburg are very inclined towards the Zurich faith. The pastors earn about 250 guilders annually. - Frölich wishes that [Konrad] Pellikan, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Kaspar] Megander, [Rudolf] Gwalther, and [Konrad] Gessner are doing well. He asks for lenient reception of his writing. - [P.S.:] He hears that the Swiss fear the Emperor's weapons; [in Augsburg], however, they fear [the Council of] Trent and its defenders; there are also reasons to assume an attack by the opponents still this summer. He hopes the Swiss are on their side. Sends Bullinger his portrait as a memento and gift.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The letters, which you sent to me some time ago along with the sacred confession of the Zurich church, will be a perpetual token of friendship between you and me, a man placed beyond all risk, and indeed for many reasons, especially because you have deemed me, as unknown to you as I am obscure to most, worthy of that remarkable memento. Command and request henceforth whatever you wish (for you are accustomed to wish for nothing but pious and honest things), and you will find Laetus ready and compliant to your desires, since both your piety and learning promise me nothing but the best and greatest things.</p>
      <p>I do not want to hide from you that I have, with particular zeal, sought the opinion of a certain not unlearned theologian of one of the confederate cities about the published Zurich confession, who, in responding to me, wrote among other things: "Would that the Zurichers had remained silent! The church would have been much happier. Their opinion removes Christ from the supper," etc. This caused me great admiration, not to say astonishment; for I had expected a very different judgment from that man. However, you should be careful not to spread this further; let it be poured into your bosom, lest the nearby wolf hears the bleating sheep. But why, you ask, does Laetus tell me this? Perhaps he himself accuses me of error? Far from it! For if, with me as witness or judge, that work of yours, that effort and industry should stand, I would certainly not hesitate to declare and assert before the whole world that, having given an account of your faith, I have seen nothing more exact, true, or holy published in our time. But I write this to you so that you may know that you will not lack neighboring slanderers, although they can do no harm.</p>
      <p>The greatest reason for writing to you now is this: Augsburg has a very large congregation, but few ministers who can worthily preside over the people, who are quite experienced and well-instructed, as the situation and time demand. And there are some among them who lean too much towards the Lutheran side, whose favor is rare both among the common people and the more sincere others. Hence, I fear that a new schism may arise in the city, which is indeed very fond of religion.</p>
      <p>I therefore beseech you by Christ to look around for a righteous and learned theologian of your true doctrine and send him to us, but in such a way that it is revealed to no one else except the most candid ones of this plan, until he whom you have chosen for us is heard here as a visitor to our city and has been discussed with him about the ecclesiastical function. Would that you would gratify us in this and share one of yours with us! I will affirm that we are much happier than before. I do not want the reason for a good pastor to remain hidden from you, so I will not promise much. It is certain that the people here are docile, very fond of peace, and also liberal and very humane, especially very eager for the Zurich confession. The ministers of our church are supported quite liberally; some receive 250 gold coins annually from the altar or rather the public treasury, some more, some less, according to their gifts and works. I dare to promise this: If we were to obtain someone like those noble ones that Zurich has, he would not lack what is worthy of a good and Christian man.</p>
      <p>I wish and pray for the well-being of the whole choir of the muses, Mr. Pellikan, Bibliander, Megander, Gwalther, Gessner, and others, among whom the name of Laetus is well heard. Kindly consider my foolish writing. Farewell, ornament of the church, and continue steadfastly. May 21, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your Georg Laetus, chief scribe of Augsburg, has signed.</p>
      <p>You Swiss, as I hear, fear the Emperor's arms, but we fear the Council of Trent and its defenders; nor am I led by empty arguments to believe that the adversaries will draw the sword against us this summer. But if it is entirely seen as such by God, I hope the Swiss will support our side.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and always.</p>
      <p>I will give you my portrait as a memento and gift.</p>
      <p>To the Christian, highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, esteemed (Antistes) of the church in Zurich, my particularly gracious lord, to his own hands. Zurich.</p>
