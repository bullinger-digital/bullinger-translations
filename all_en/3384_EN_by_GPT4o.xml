      <p>Greetings. Your Genatius returned amidst the waves of my affairs, so that I could not write to you more extensively or converse with him. I am tormented by public concerns and exhausted by unending labors.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, the Lord strengthens me.</p>
      <p>I am sending 26 of our sermons on the first discourse of Jeremiah and I ask you to kindly accept this small gift from me. You will understand the news I have about the Worms colloquy and other matters from the letters written to Mr. Fabritius, and forgive me for writing to one person while consulting my own affairs and instructing him to share what I have written with you.</p>
      <p>I alone am not sufficient for writing so many letters; I lack a scribe, and even if one were at hand, often there is such a rush that nothing would have been gained from his work for me. If it could be done conveniently for you and without trouble or loss, you would be expected to come to us after the Martinmas fair. But do what seems best to you.</p>
      <p>I regard your son as my own.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with your father-in-law and your entire family.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich, 29th October 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>You would do me a favor if you sent me the exposition of the Apocalypse by that Conrad of Mantua. To the truly noble man by virtue and lineage, Mr. Friedrich von Salis, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
