      <p>S. D. You rightly reproach me, if indeed you can reproach me, for not writing to you, my most esteemed Myconius, for almost two whole months. However, I trust that I am sufficiently excused in your eyes, as I know you are convinced that Bullinger does not refrain from writing out of malice or indignation, but for other reasons whenever he does not write. I could indeed offer many reasons; but since I need no justification with you, I will continue.</p>
      <p>Firstly, there is nothing in the letters to which a response is necessary; the earlier ones were dated August 19, the later ones August 26, and the last ones were brought by Vogler, dated September 19. In these, you urge me to write and speak against Satan, who in our age does not cease to tempt and push the strong, and to overthrow and subvert the weaker. You rightly advise; we do what we can to the best of our ability, and as much as the Lord grants grace. I certainly devote all the time that I do not spend on public sermons, pious conversations, and writing letters, to writing my Decades, but I make little progress in the meantime, because the tasks are varied and many, and indeed more burdensome than I can bear. Sometimes I collapse, exhausted by work, sometimes I do what I do without much enthusiasm. You think the magistrate's edict is the reason we write and print less. Whoever told you this, told you something completely false; the magistrate has not prohibited us from anything, nor have we requested anything from him that he has denied. None of us wishes to write or print anything against the Interim; enough has been written against the Interim in both Latin and German, enough has been provided for the pious, enough caution for those who do not wish to perish; for those who wish to perish, writing, singing, speaking, and advising is in vain. The belly has no ears or eyes. I hope we are engaged in far more useful matters here. May the Lord grant us His spirit.</p>
      <p>In our affairs, I have certainly not seen any fear of the Emperor so far. If there were fear of the Emperor among us, believe me, they would act differently than they do, especially since many opportunities arise.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the royal envoy, coming from Solothurn, proposed to the council with many sweet words how highly the king values Zurich, the reserved place in that famous alliance with the Zurichers, and that the king desires nothing more ardently. He spoke much about the king's benevolence, the usefulness of this alliance, etc. The response was brief and concise: one has unanimously agreed in city and land, to avoid all lords and princes and not to enter into this alliance, for many reasons; yet what one owes the king in other ways, one is willing to do. My lords will not go further, etc.</p>
      <p>Before St. Matthew's Day, the Count of Heiligenberg and the bailiff came to Constance, having seated themselves in the Kaufhaus with great solemnity in the name of the Emperor. The entire council came before them and paid them homage (adored the image of the beast), whereupon the Emperor's absolution was read, and they were released from the ban and re-ban and taken into the Emperor's bosom. Thereupon, much joy, shooting, and jubilation took place. There are still 40 servants there as an addition.</p>
      <p>Friends from England sent a very extensive disputation containing 36 full pages and handwritten about the Eucharist by Dr. Peter Martyr against the Oxford doctors. He proved that transubstantiation and corporal presence are nothing.</p>
      <p>I cannot write more. I commend this son of ours to you in the Lord. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 3, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
