      <p>Greetings. The bearer of this letter to you is the scribe of our monastery.</p>
      <p>He has recommended his son to Mr. Gwalther, whom he wishes to devote himself to studies in your school, and I beseech you to occasionally look after him. He was my companion for over two years, he is a pious and good boy; I hope he will make better progress with you. Furthermore, my godfather, who is planning a journey to you, was very eager to have the opportunity to meet you; hence, he helped me as much as he could to gather what you have long requested and expected, but I have not yet received from only two places; which I hope to receive shortly and perhaps even today. I found more than I had hoped for; by Thursday or Friday, you will receive them, God willing. There is no news with us; various rumors are spreading about the Valesians; there are strange practices heard from 5 or 7 Swiss Cantons, which, unless the Lord averts, will end in the ruin of Switzerland. It is rumored that Hesse and the Palatinate are working on holding a conference between the Lutherans and the Zwinglians, and that you and Martyr have already been called and summoned by them.</p>
      <p>However, nothing is certain to us.</p>
      <p>If you have any leisure, please inform us of what you can.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with all the pious.</p>
      <p>Our Simpertus greets you.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, August 6, 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Jakob Rüeger.</p>
      <p>To the man endowed with singular learning, piety, and humanity, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and brother in Christ.</p>
