      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, Mr. Tscharner, the consul of our city, is coming to you; he is traveling to Lyon and from there, as far as I judge, to the king himself. He is conducting the business of the Pellizari family on behalf of the Three Leagues (by whom he is sent with public authority).</p>
      <p>Therefore, if you are going to write anything to friends in France or Geneva, you have here a reliable person.</p>
      <p>There is no need for me to recommend him to you, as he is already most commendable to you. If you, if your senate, bestow any honor and duty upon him, you will be doing something worthy of yourselves; you will encourage your consuls to do this.</p>
      <p>He will explain in person what has been done with the royal envoy. I recently wrote to you and informed you about the envoy's departure.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, nothing has been brought from Italy that you would want to know. I am amazed that this most miserable man is so delirious; but more so that the prince indulges his follies.</p>
      <p>I pray to God to preserve you for us.</p>
      <p>Farewell, Reverend Father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, March 16, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>It has been reported to us that Mr. Calvin is mortally ill, which news has greatly alarmed us.</p>
      <p>If you assist Mr. Consul with your letters to friends in Lyon and at court, you would be doing something most pleasing to all of us. To the most honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and much-revered father in Christ. Zurich.</p>
