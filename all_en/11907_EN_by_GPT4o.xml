    <p xml:id="regest1">Gifts him the writing that was created within 14 weeks against Cochläus [„Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio“] and asks for his judgment; wants to know whether Cochläus is staying in Ingolstadt or Ottobeuren, as he intends to send him the book with an accompanying letter. Praises Vadian's efforts against Schwenckfeld and sends him on loan the writing sent by Gervasius [Schuler] [„Summarium von zwaierlai stande“? - see above No. 1843], which contains all the filth [of his heresy] in condensed form - may God enlighten him as a blind man or destroy him as a heretic! -; Vadian should make no concessions to him. The colleagues [in Zürich] send their regards and hope that after refuting Schwenckfeld, he will complete his four books [„De quatuor christianismi aetatibus“; see HBBW XIII 69]. Regards.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I have finally completed my response to Cochläus's booklet, both written and published within 14 weeks. I have indeed endured and digested many troubles. You rightly think that I have a healthy and voracious appetite here. Meanwhile, and not without great effort, I have written what you see. I gift you this book and ask you to consider this small gift kindly and to freely express your opinion, and whatever you think, please communicate it freely. But where might Cochläus be? I would like to send him a copy along with a letter, but I do not know exactly whether he is in Ingolstadt or Ottobeuren. If you know, please let me know.</p>
      <p>You do a favor by dedicating yourself entirely to Schwenckfeld. I will support your effort, and therefore I share with you the booklet that D. Gervasius, the minister of the Memmingen church, sent these days, but on the condition that, once you have read it and used it, you return it. It will relieve you with much reading. For he has gathered filth into one abyss. May the Lord either enlighten the blind man or destroy the heresiarch. I pray that you do not attribute anything to him nor, as you have been accustomed to, praise the unpraiseworthy. He is not worth it. I have no new news. All the brothers greet you. Meanwhile, we hope that after refuting Schwenckfeld, you will complete your four books, for it is not right that they should go to waste. Farewell with all yours. Zürich, March 8, 1544. Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Joachim Vadian, his most esteemed lord.</p>
