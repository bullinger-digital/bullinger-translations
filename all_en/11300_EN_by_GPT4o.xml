    <p xml:id="regest1">Remains silent on the already retracted criticism; Grynaeus will be the first to read their shared copy of Bullinger's [„De origine erroris“]. [Henry VIII] has not yet been admitted to the [Schmalkaldic] League; from Italy, apart from the news about England shared by Bullinger, it is further reported that [Francis I] has mediated a peace between [Charles V] and [Suleiman I], the fleet [of the League against the Turks] has been withdrawn, the Emperor intends to travel to the Netherlands via Milan, and his friendship with [Francis I] will lead to the restitution of Savoy. Sadoleto has called on the people of Geneva to abandon the Gospel; a response is being prepared. A report from Frankfurt, according to which the proposals of the imperial orator [Johann von Weeze] would only be accepted with reservations, gives cause for hope; now negotiations are to be held on a six-month truce and a new meeting in Nuremberg. Frecht and Schwenckfeld are disputing over the deification of Christ; Bullinger is to support Frecht by forwarding Vadian's letter [No. 894] and also send a copy to Basel, as Grynaeus must respond to a dispatch from [Hieronymus zum Lamb?] in Speyer.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Since you have excused your own reproach, there is no need for a defense. I would have read your book long ago if it were mine; it must first be bound in this way, then I will gladly concede the earlier ones to Grynaeus; thus it will come into my hands only after I don't know how long a time.</p>
      <p>Good men write that the Englishman (Henry VIII) has not been admitted into the league nor will be admitted until he reforms the church. What you wrote from a certain Roman about the kingdom of England, an old tribune later read to me, and on the same day's supper, I saw letters written in Italian, which contained the same, moreover, that the Frenchman (Francis I) had effected a peace between the Emperor (Charles V) and the Turk (Suleiman I) for five years. As evidence of this, ships that had been laden with arms and provisions have returned to Genoa and the provisions unloaded to be sold; also, the ships, which Andreas (Andrea Doria) had commanded until now, have been brought back to Spain. The Emperor is soon to come to Milan, from there either by ship or through France to descend into Lower Germany. Such great friendship exists between the Emperor and the Frenchman as cannot exist between any others. Hence the agreement that the Savoyard (Duke of Savoy) will be restored at some point.</p>
      <p>From other letters to me, it is clear that the Senate and brothers of Geneva have been urged by letters from Sadoleto to abandon the Gospel; the brothers have piously responded, the Senate is preparing a response, but it is not known what kind.</p>
      <p>I return to the Englishman. I was grieved that he was not admitted into the league, but letters from Frankfurt have erased my grief. The Emperor's orator (Johann von Weeze) clings with great persistence to these three articles: that our people should not admit anyone else into the league, that no one from the clergy should be removed from their place, and that they should be present against the Turk. Our people admitted the first, but with this condition, that they also do not admit anyone into their league and that defense is free even for non-allies or that peace is promised to such. This response restored my hope. They also permitted the second, provided that schools and parishes are provided for from the goods of the churches, and the third as well, if the other states similarly bring aid. But the orator refuses these conditions, so you understand that they foster nothing but deceit. He finally offered a truce for six months, and before a response, it was said that the imperial envoy would bring some new matter. It is awaited what that will be. If a truce is agreed upon, a meeting of learned and secular men will be held in the city of Nuremberg.</p>
      <p>All these things are certain.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is a contention between Frecht of Ulm and Schwenckfeld about the deification of Christ; a booklet of his was sent to Grynaeus from Speyer. The letter of Consul Joachim about the glorification of Christ, which we judged most useful for settling that matter, comes to mind (although you sent it here long ago, we do not know where it is). Grynaeus thinks the letter should be copied and sent to Constance and from there to Frecht; for that would be most beneficial. For it contains what would wipe away Schwenckfeld's error about the distinction between the deified and glorified Christ; for he clings to this.</p>
      <p>It would be beneficial to do this in time before the contention comes into the open. Since Grynaeus must also respond to the doctor of laws from Speyer, it would not be useless if we could also have the same letter.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours and urge the church to pray to the Lord for help against such insidious enemies.</p>
      <p>Basel, April 22, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant and learned bishop of Zurich, his most venerable in the Lord.</p>
