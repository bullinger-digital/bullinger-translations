    <p xml:id="regest1">Was concerned about rumors of the plague in Zurich, but received reassuring news from Konrad Wüst. Has not yet been able to speak to [Count Georg of Württemberg], who is staying in Montbéliard. Repeatedly requests a treatise on providence and predestination, as well as Bullinger's new commentaries on the Pauline letters and ten copies of the [Zurich] liturgical order. Points out that the [publication of a handbook for the organization of church affairs] proposed in the other letter [No. 714] would also be of great benefit to the Zurich church. Inquires about the truth of rumors regarding a conflict over French pensions and study scholarships, the defection of Basel from the Confederates, the presence of the Solothurn "bandits" in Strasbourg, the rapprochement between King [Henry VIII] and the Schmalkaldic League, as well as the removal of cult images in England, and asks about the status of the Geneva affair, all in the hope of being able to strengthen his fellow officials with good news. Greetings.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord God the Father through Jesus Christ, our Savior. Amen.</p>
      <p>Conrad Wüst, our fellow citizen, was with me not long ago, faithfully recounting everything in order about what is happening with you, and he was clearly concerned for all of you - for everything here is filled with false rumors - and he made me completely assured, so that I can fear less for you, my most beloved brothers, since he indicated that the plague is raging among you far more mildly than the rumors suggested. Therefore, I rejoice greatly and give immense thanks to my God for the common safety and well-being of you and your families. But I do not think you will believe how much joy I felt when I inquired from the man individually and understood that everything is safe. For it is not necessary to recount to you how dire the rumors were that circulated here. It is more than enough for me that I have discovered all these to be false. May the Lord in His mercy grant that we may not have to hear anything more grievous from either side in the future. Amen.</p>
      <p>Now, regarding my own affairs, since I have not yet met with our prince - for he is in Montbéliard - there is nothing at present that I can either inform you of or specifically request from you, except for this one thing: that you send me a brief description of the entire matter concerning the providence of God, predestination, and related topics; something which I have repeatedly requested from you, my most esteemed Theodore, before I left Zurich. You will, however, oblige a friend who is asking for something so fair and beneficial to his church. And you, my Bullinger, if you have completed the annotations on the remaining Pauline epistles, namely Galatians, Ephesians, Colossians, Philippians, Thessalonians, Philemon, Timothy, and Titus, ensure that they are sent to me; also, ten copies of the liturgical order, as they call it. And if there is anything else that is first published among you, I would like it to be sent to us with this messenger. I would not believe that you would deceive me.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have included in common letters what I consider to be beneficial to the commonwealth of the churches, especially those of the Dukes of Württemberg. It will be your duty, therefore, to assist not so much me as the entire church of Christ, especially because your own affairs are also involved there. For you can, with this opportune occasion, benefit not so much others as yourselves. You understand, of course, what I mean.</p>
      <p>Finally, there is something else I wish to know from you. There is a persistent rumor here that the King of France has renounced the pension to the Five Cantons and, as evidence of this, has sent home the young men who were living on royal stipends in the academies of France. Moreover, it is said that the people of Basel have also defected from those cantons to the imperial cities. Again, those nine Solothurners, expelled from their homeland and, as I can write not without sorrow, from all of Switzerland, are said to be living in Strasbourg, doing well, well-equipped with gold, clothes, and arms, and whispering to some that their affairs will soon be settled. It is also said that the King of England has conspired with the evangelical princes and cities in defense of the word and has removed idols and other such impious things from all the temples throughout the kingdom. Since I wish these things to be true, if you have any certainty about these matters or if there is anything else that you think would contribute to the promotion of God's glory and that we would be pleased to hear, and finally, how the affairs of Geneva stand, please inform me in writing, so that I may also have something with which to retain, encourage, recall, and cheer up our brothers here, who are partly still fearful, partly wavering, and looking back from time to time.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, most beloved teachers and brothers. Greet on my behalf the wives, especially the mother, the godfather of my newly born daughter, both consuls, Rudolf Lavater, Heinrich Ron, Andreas Gessner, Caspar Nägeli, Nikolaus Brunner, Kamlin Konrad Escher and Luchsinger, Negelin, Bachofen, and the others who favor Christ among the consulars, especially Johann Hab, Ulrich Trinkler, Luipold Grebel, and our chamberlain and cellarer. I also wish the lady of the blue banner and her entire family to be greeted very much. And if it is not too much trouble, greet Uttinger, Steiner, Batt, Amman, Collin, Johann Heinrich Göldlin, Wyss, and their wives, especially Michael Schwitzer and Christoph Froschauer. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr, the day after Epiphany 1536.</p>
      <p>Pray for me and our church.</p>
      <p>Your same Erasmus Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious men Heinrich Bullinger and Theodor Bibliander, bishops and doctors of the church of Zurich, most beloved and esteemed teachers and brothers in Christ.</p>
