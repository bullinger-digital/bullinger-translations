    <p xml:id="regest1">Not to instruct Winkeli in matters of faith - he has proven enough steadfastness in his distress - but to strengthen the ignorant and the timid and to refute the claims of the opponents, Bullinger explains in this writing that the Reformed possess the old and true faith. Greetings.</p>

      <p>To the pious, honorable, and wise Hans Heinrich Winkeli, currently residing in Basel, his beloved brother, Heinrich Bullinger wishes much salvation through Jesus Christ, our only savior.</p>
      <p>Although I have no doubt and know very well that you, beloved brother, need little instruction in the faith in Jesus Christ, as you have proven the holy faith in our named Lord Jesus with deeds through much tribulation, disgrace, misery, and loss of your goods and have publicly confessed it; nevertheless, I have wanted to present this brief opinion (explanation) of our holy faith to you for the honor and advancement of our faith, also for the good of many simple and uninformed people and from your earnest efforts, so that the faint-hearted may gain and be strengthened in heart when they see that our holy faith has such a glorious form, that it is so well-founded and that all the old, wise, learned, pious, and holy people from the beginning of the world have held it; that also those (if they want) would have a friendly warning, who call and persecute such our not only old, but very ancient, true, well-founded, and undoubted, holy and unblemished faith as new and sectarian. May God grant them and us that we rely entirely on Jesus Christ alone and faithfully follow his teachings. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, in March 1537.</p>
      <p>My beloved brother Leo Jud, your cousin, greets you and your dear wife.</p>
