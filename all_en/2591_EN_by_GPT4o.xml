      <p>S. D. If I did not know, honorable and dearest relative, with what faith and piety you are endowed, I would have long since prepared consolation for you. Your dear wife has departed to Him whom she always desired, who is also our hope and expectation; you have not lost her, but sent her ahead. She has been freed from very severe troubles, for you know better than I how much she has been afflicted by the force of illness for a long time, so I think we should thank God for freeing her from such great pains. Oh, how blessed she is, who now enjoys the sight of Him, who is all in all and in whose presence there is fullness of joy. Therefore, with a secure and joyful mind, congratulate her on her salvation and blessedness. Pray to the Lord that He may grant you, when it seems good to His will, to attain the same purity of faith; for here we have no lasting place, but we seek the future one. Moreover, the age is so calamitous that those who are delivered from countless evils by a holy and blessed death seem to be the most fortunate, as the most ungrateful world is subjected to the just judgment of God. It seems most convenient and best for you if you come to us here; for you will have more peace and consolation. I will be yours, as I have always been, and I will devote myself entirely to you. Farewell. May the Lord strengthen your mind in all good.</p>

      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The Hägi from Hengst is with me as a bailiff of Obwalden's brother, and he asked me if I would demand the main estate over there. I answered that I have no right to do so, as the guarantors and pledges remain unchanged and the interest has been paid to me, etc., and I demanded that since Heini Fußacher, who was a guarantor and had vouched with Rodolff Steiger, has died, he should provide me with another suitable person in Fußacher's place, and also promptly pay the interest of 10 guilders due on St. Nicholas' Day, etc.</p>
      <p>No one comes forward, and they do not pay me the interest, nor do they show a guarantor. Therefore, my request is that you inform Hägi, who spoke with me, is his bailiff, and heard the main letter from me, that he should settle the interest of 10 guilders first and provide a guarantor promptly. If the money of 10 guilders is not available by Friday and until the coming Sunday, then summon Marti Steiger to fulfill the obligation the following week.</p>
      <p>However, tell this to Hägi or the brothers. And we ask you for an answer. Do as you think is right, and I trust you. God be with you.</p>
      <p>To the honorable Mr. Peter Simler, dean of Kappel, his most esteemed relative and very dear brother.</p>
      <p>Kappel.</p>
