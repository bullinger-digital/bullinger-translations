      <p>Reverend and most esteemed lord of mine.</p>
      <p>I encountered the lord's servant on the journey, who, as I was going, presented me with his own handwritten document, which contained the news he had, so that I might share it with your reverence, which I am doing immediately in this writing. On the 18th day, in the main church of Paris, the king took an oath to maintain peace in the presence of the Duke of Alba, Prince of Orange, and Count of Egmont, representing the Catholic king. The splendor on both sides was very rich, yet the French seemed superior, especially since the Duke of Alba himself, the head of the delegation, was dressed below mediocrity, though with a very sumptuous retinue. On the 22nd day, he was to celebrate the betrothal in the name of his king with Isabella, the first of the royal daughters, and on the 25th, the Duke of Savoy was to do the same with Margaret, the king's sister.</p>
      <p>The month was not inscribed here.</p>
      <p>However, in the meantime, I could not meet with the orator or Philipp to inquire about the month.</p>
      <p>I think these events took place in the month of June.</p>
