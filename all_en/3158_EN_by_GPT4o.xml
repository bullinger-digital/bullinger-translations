      <p>S. D. I am truly as glad to hear that you are now in good health, most illustrious and learned man, as if I myself had recovered my former health after being freed from a severe illness. I will provide your son Heinrich with whatever services I can, and indeed, I will strive at all times to accomplish the other matters you write about, which befit someone who sincerely wishes well for you and yours. What has been certainly conveyed to me about the conference of chosen men can be briefly explained, and I send these to you on the enclosed paper, which you see attached. As for the good things that are to be expected, I truly fear that it may be more a matter of wishing than of ever seeing them. It seems that the minds of some powerful individuals are chiefly inclined to temper both the doctrine and the rites of the church in such a way that, just as a certain religion mixed with law and gospel was once imposed on the Galatians, so now some new body, partly formed from the gospel and partly from the papacy, may be formed. But even if the effort succeeds as well and clearly as the seriously pious, learned men, and those devoted to the glory of Christ and common concord desire, it is certain that some ambitious and contentious individuals will emerge, who cannot be satisfied as long as everything is not done according to their opinion, and they would rather mix heaven with earth than give place to the counsels of the pious. And I truly fear that the public welfare of the churches is of little concern to the adversaries and that they wish nothing less than for the churches to be ordered according to the prescription of the word of God. They promise great things (for what harm is there in promising, as someone said); but it is credible that those splendid promises tend elsewhere than they profess. However, it does not matter much with what mind they do these things, as long as in the meantime our people direct all their efforts and labors to the glory of God. For we have experienced that never before have conferences been held without some fruit following, even among those from whom we least expected it. Everywhere the harvest is plentiful; the pious eagerly raise their heads everywhere, expecting their workers. Therefore, I hope that although many of our people now conduct the business of the gospel very coldly, it will soon happen that some will emerge from whom marvelous fruits of the kingdom of God will be brought forth. In Brabant, Flanders, and the entire Belgian region, Satan is now raging, besides the fact that they are oppressed by a severe war undertaken against the French, that there is great scarcity of provisions everywhere (for in Hainaut and the county of Artois, over a thousand people are said to have perished from hunger), besides the fact that in the preceding year many, especially the powerful and wealthy, perished from various acute diseases, and that they are daily exhausted by unheard-of exactions, now with new decrees proposed, the confessors of evangelical truth are cruelly dragged to punishments and their properties are confiscated to the treasury.</p>
      <p>In Ghent, fifty citizens are said to have been recently thrown into prison, more than eighty have fled, some have been extinguished by the dire torments of fire and have endured death with great constancy. Similar things are happening in Bruges and elsewhere. In Antwerp, as I have heard from merchants, twenty were captured a few days ago.</p>
      <p>Many from different cities are voluntarily going into exile. What more? Perhaps God wills that the impious fill up the measure of their fathers, and when their cruelty has reached its limit, the church may begin to fare better in those places. It is our duty to pray with ardent vows to the heavenly Father, that He may preserve and strengthen both those who will be involved in the conference and those who suffer persecution for righteousness in doctrine and confession of the truth. Meanwhile, King Philipp is acting gently in Britain. For at the beginning of this year, having sent envoys to test the minds of the Britons, asking whether they would be willing to help against the French or not, they immediately promised that they would gladly send fourteen thousand troops, whom they would support at their own expense for four months. Moreover, they would add two hundred thousand gold coins, a type you know, I suppose. Philipp, having unexpectedly experienced such kindness, soon went to Britain himself and, having convened the assembly (which they call parliament), he is striving to obtain from the nobles that he be adorned with the diadem and all the royal insignia according to custom.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the proud queen is seeking this glory for herself and her own by all means. With us, everything is still safe and tranquil, although not far from Bremen on the Elbe, some troops have been assembled, uncertain whether they were conscripted for the French or for King Philipp, and there is a rumor that Duke Heinrich of Brunswick wants to crush them if they are indeed to be brought to the French, before they turn elsewhere. On the first of May, some princes will again convene in Frankfurt to discuss the matter that concerns our prince with the Count of Nassau, who perhaps will also consult about other useful matters at the same time. The illustrious man, Lord Philipp Melanchthon, has been summoned by the most illustrious Elector Palatine prince to organize the academic republic in Heidelberg, from where he is believed to be heading to Worms, where learned men will confer. We hope he will make the journey from Marburg, as we have understood he has indicated to some through letters, and recently the most honorable Lord P. Vergerius, who, returning from the Palatinate (where he says the evangelical doctrine is being planted with incredible success), visited Lord Philipp in Wittenberg and deigned to direct himself to us, where he was very kindly received by both princes, that is, both the elder Philipp and the younger Wilhelm; for the court has now been with us for the sixth month and is believed to remain for another five or six months, since the castle at Kassel, where the most illustrious princes usually reside, is now being made larger and more splendid with new buildings added. Johannes Leningus sends his book to you, to live or perish by your judgment; for he allows it to be reviewed by you and, if it seems so, to be published, as I think he more fully attests in the attached letter.</p>
      <p>The young men who are returning to you have conducted themselves honorably, and there is nothing to be said against them. Each of them once responded to theological theses in my presence as the presiding officer in the school, but Johannes Bernardus did so more successfully, as he has progressed further in the study of letters and has stayed with us longer. Towards those who have now arrived, I will show both my effort and goodwill as much as I can. Please commend me to all the fellow ministers and doctors both in the church and in the school, especially to Lord Peter Martyr. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Marburg, on the 21st day of April 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Andreas Hyperius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zürich, to be honored with the highest respect. In Zürich.</p>
