    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The people of Zurich have received the letter from their colleagues in Strasbourg [HBBW XVIII, No. 2704, dated December 6, 1546] well. Due to their many tasks, they are only now able to respond to it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] In their letter, the people of Strasbourg explained how they have dealt with the Zurich [students], Ludwig Lavater and Jakob Gessner. They further asked the Zurich pastors to urge their young people not to refuse to participate in the Strasbourg communion, especially since nothing else is expected of them than to adhere to the Basel Confession of Faith, as well as Paul's statement: "The bread that we break, etc."</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] First, the people of Strasbourg should know that these young people do not receive scholarships from the Zurich church, but are financially supported by their parents. The latter admonished them not to abandon the faith in which they were raised. For if they were to renounce it, they would have to seek another homeland and other parents! The pastors and teachers of Zurich also admonished them in this sense. And since every participant in the communion professes their faith, they were urged by their pastors and teachers not to celebrate communion with people whom they knew did not share the Zurich view of the communion. So if the young people refused to participate in the communion in Strasbourg, it can be assumed that the same is not taught there as in Zurich. Therefore, the people of Zurich cannot demand their young people to change their stance.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] For if they were to participate in the communion in Strasbourg, they would thereby indicate that they approve of the local view of the sacraments. Or should they participate in something they do not believe in? And why should their teachers and pastors urge them to act against their conviction and conscience? They are old and wise enough to recognize the doctrinal differences between Zurich and Strasbourg themselves!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Apparently, nothing else is being demanded of them than to adhere to Paul's words "the bread that we break, is it not [a participation in the body of Christ?]". But the difference between Zurich and Strasbourg lies precisely in the interpretation of these words. Furthermore, participation in the sacraments presupposes sincerity and a shared faith with the other participants. But Bucer does not teach like the people of Zurich! Indeed, he has even changed his opinion on this matter! The people of Zurich understand the words of the Apostle just as they were interpreted during the Bern Disputation [of 1528] (a disputation that Bucer himself signed) and as Bucer presented them in his Enarrationes [perpetuae in sacra quatuor] Evangelia or in his "Arbogast". But since Bucer changed his opinion a few years ago to align with Luther's teaching, the people of Zurich, who still hold the same view as Paul, no longer share his view. More need not be said here. The people of Zurich believe they have already responded sufficiently to Luther. And what he stubbornly thought about the communion and about the people of Zurich until his death, even after the response addressed to him by the people of Zurich, is clearly expressed in his writing against the theologians of Leuven: "Art. 15. In the Eucharist, this honorable and worship-worthy sacrament, the actual body and blood of Christ are present, offered to both the worthy and the unworthy, and truly received by them." Luther claims to have learned this from 1Cor 10 for a long time! He further writes: "Art. 27. We are very cautious of the heretics. Thus, the Zwinglians and all sacramentarians (who deny that the body and blood of Christ are physically received with the mouth in the venerable Eucharist) are not part of the Church of God!" So much for Luther, who presented himself as an orthodox and catholic doctor of the church.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] In their letter, the people of Strasbourg write that they pray to the Lord to lead the people of Zurich to the correct understanding of the people of Strasbourg. This means, therefore, that the people of Zurich do not share the understanding of the Lord! But there is only one controversy between the people of Zurich and the people of Strasbourg, that over the passage of Paul in 1Cor 10 and over the words of the Lord: "This is my body". Whenever the words of Paul are presented to the people of Zurich, they respond that they need no other confession than one that contains these words; but it is obvious that the people of Strasbourg interpret that passage differently than the people of Zurich and therefore do not confess the same. So how should the people of Zurich urge their compatriots to participate in the communion with the people of Strasbourg in faith in the words of the Apostle, when Bucer interprets these words quite differently than the people of Zurich? When celebrating a sacrament (an act that is an expression of each person's confession of faith), one must not pretend or conceal anything; all the more so, as (according to Luther's opinion) the people of Zurich should not even be considered members of Christ! So if the people of Strasbourg allowed a person from Zurich to participate in the communion, they would either be opposing Luther's opinion or acting inconsistently.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Now to the Basel Confession of Faith. The churches of Helvetia intended at that time to draft a confession of faith to be able to give an account of their faith to those who would demand it. Thus, councilors and pastors were sent to a synod in Basel at the behest of the Helvetian authorities. They soon set to work and had already drafted most of the confession of faith when Wolfgang Capito and Bucer arrived in Basel and interrupted the course of the work. The latter gave the envoys great hope for an agreement with Luther. In the article on the communion, they proposed to delete some passages, change others, and also recommended the use of certain words. After arguing about it for more than a day, it was decided, in view of a possible agreement with Luther, to use these words proposed by Bucer, but on the condition that the Helvetian churches would not be obligated to anything by the use of these words and would still have the right to interpret these words in their own sense. Bucer also assured at that time that these changes were not undertaken to divert the Helvetian churches from their Bern Disputation or from their already long-declared understanding of the communion and lead them to Lutheranism, but only for the sake of unity, as these expressions were suitable to enchant the very embittered minds of the opponents. Bucer himself can confirm this. The records of this meeting also testify to this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Since then, it has been known that the use of these words was completely in vain. However, the Helvetian churches have long not lost the right to interpret these words in a way that they can justify with their teaching. So it makes no sense to now hold the words of the Basel Confession against the Helvetian churches. If someone therefore tries to impose an opinion on them that does not correspond to their understanding of this confession, they will be immediately rejected. Participating in the communion under the sign of the Basel Confession means nothing else for the Helvetian churches than participating in it with the faith set forth in the last response to Luther! Therefore, it is not possible for the people of Zurich to celebrate communion together with Lutherans.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] However, by refraining from the Strasbourg communion, the people of Zurich do not express any contempt for the local church, just as they have never despised anyone who did not participate in their communion. Neither have they forced anyone to do so, nor have they tried to prevent them from doing so.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] May the people of Strasbourg allow the young people of Zurich to practice their faith undisturbed and not continue to try to force them into something they cannot justify with their conscience and faith! The people of Zurich like the Strasbourg school and the discipline practiced there. They also hold the people of Strasbourg dear. Therefore, they would like to see Zurich residents continue to be able to live in Strasbourg for a time in the future.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] However, if the people of Strasbourg believe that this request could bring their church into disrepute or even harm, the people of Zurich would not only refrain from sending any more students to Strasbourg, but would also immediately recall the young people currently staying in Strasbourg. The people of Zurich cannot act otherwise! They know whom they believe in, and strengthened by God, they have no doubt about their view. Nor do they want to knowingly sin against the Lord. The people of Strasbourg should therefore remain well-disposed towards the people of Zurich and maintain peace with them until the Lord leads to a simpler and purer teaching in the matter of the communion!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Finally, the most important thing: The people of Zurich thank the people of Strasbourg for the loyalty, diligence, and care they have shown them so far. The Lord will reward them for it. In return, the people of Zurich also promise their loyalty and diligence. They will assist the people of Strasbourg should an opportunity arise.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] The times are hard, as the people of Strasbourg have already emphasized in their letter. However, the sins of the believers would require even worse! Therefore, the people of Strasbourg and Zurich should call their respective communities to repentance. Through the [current] plague, the believers are being sorted and tested from the unbelievers. Therefore, it is important to fully surrender to the Lord and ask Him not to abandon His own. The truth will ultimately prevail, even if the world would defeat the confessors of the truth, for God's judgment is drawing near!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] The people of Strasbourg should prove steadfast against the Antichrist! Greetings in Christ.</p>

      <p>To Lord Martin Bucer and the school authorities of Strasbourg.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Greetings. We have received your letters, esteemed and beloved brothers in the Lord, to which we respond later than intended due to our own affairs. You have thoroughly explained what has been done with our young men, Ludwig Lavater and Jakob Gessner; you especially request that we encourage them not to refuse to partake in the sacraments with you in the Lord, since you require nothing more from them than our Basel Confession, indeed only Paul's statement: "The bread that we break" [1 Cor. 10:16] etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Regarding the young men, brothers, know this: They are not supported by the church's stipend but by their parents' expenses, who instructed them, as they went abroad, to return with the faith and profession of faith with which they were equipped and confirmed, or to seek other homes and parents if they professed another faith upon returning. We, too, as their pastors and teachers, exhorted them to persevere in the faith they learned from their early years in our church, which their holy parents instilled in them by God's inspiration. Since we publicly profess our faith through the communion of the sacraments, we diligently advised them not to commune with those whom they understand do not share the same doctrine and faith with us in dogmas and sacraments. Now, because they have thus far refused to commune with you, we easily gather that they understand the doctrine of the Lord's Supper taught in Strasbourg is not the same as what they learned and absorbed in Zurich from their parents and us, their teachers. Therefore, to be candid and straightforward, we cannot be their advocates to do what their parents were not advocates for, and we also advised against.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Those who commune with you in the sacraments profess by that very communion that they share the same faith with you regarding the sacraments. But our young men do not share the same faith with you; why then should they outwardly profess what they do not inwardly feel in their hearts? Or why should we command them to act against their conscience and personal conviction? They are of mature age, use sound reason, and understand what is taught publicly in both places.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>However, nothing is required of them but the Pauline confession: "The bread that we break, is it not" [1 Cor. 10:16] etc. But listen, brothers, our controversy is not about Paul's words, but about the meaning of Paul's words. Faithful reception of the sacraments requires truth and genuine confession, and rejects simulation. Bucer and we do not have the same judgment about that passage of Paul, nor the same opinion; indeed, we would agree excellently with Bucer if he did not dissent from himself. For we understand that passage and the meaning of Paul's words as it was first explained in the Bern Disputation, to which he subscribed, then in Bucer's expositions of the Gospels, and finally in his Arbogast. But since he changed his doctrine and joined the late blessed Luther, who held a different opinion, and thus departed from himself, we hold a different opinion from them, but not different from St. Paul. We do not wish to discuss this matter more extensively at present. We believe we have sufficiently responded to Luther, who, until the end, stubbornly held his view on the Lord's Supper, and what he thought of us, even after our response, shortly before he passed away, he publicly testified in writing against the theologians of Leuven: "15. In the Eucharist, this venerable and adorable sacrament, the body and blood of Christ are truly present, offered, and received by both the worthy and the unworthy." He wrote this long ago in books published, claiming to have learned it from the words of the apostle 1 Cor. 10 [16]. He soon added in proposition "27: We seriously consider heretics," he says, "and alien to the church of God are the Zwinglians and all sacramentarians, who deny that the body and blood of Christ are carnally received in the venerable Eucharist." Thus he, who is proclaimed to be an orthodox and catholic doctor of the church.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>In your letter to us, you pray that the Lord may inspire us with the same opinion as yours and indeed His own regarding the controversial places of the churches and their ministers. We cannot understand this otherwise than that we do not hold His, that is, the Lord's, opinion, but an alien and different one from yours. For we have no controversy with you about other places than the passage of Paul 1 Cor. 10 [16f] and the words of the Lord: "This is my body" [1 Cor. 11:24] etc. However, Paul's words are objected to us, however it is said by our people that no other confession is required than that contained in Paul's words, it is nevertheless manifest that, since the sense of the words is not the same for both parties, the confession is not the same. How then can we be advocates for our people to commune with you under the faith of Paul's words, when Bucer interprets Paul's words in his own way, and we in another? Meanwhile, in the celebration of the sacraments, which concerns the mysteries and profession of faith, it is not permitted to simulate or dissimulate anything: not to mention that those who subscribed to Luther cannot recognize us as members of Christ, or, if they do recognize us, they refute Luther's judgment in this matter, and thus contradict themselves.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Regarding the Basel Confession, brothers, the matter stands thus. The Helvetian churches convened in a synod in Basel, with delegates sent from the senators and ministers: It was intended to draft a confession of faith to give an account of our faith to those who demanded it. For this purpose, the ministers sat down at the senators' command, and had already completed a good part of the confession, when Wolfgang Capito and Bucer of blessed memory intervened, interrupted our course, made great promises of concord with Luther and his followers, and suggested certain words in the matter of the Lord's Supper, which they said would be less offensive to Luther, and therefore advised us to expunge some of our words and insert theirs; about which, after more than a whole day of debate, it was finally agreed, under the hope of concord, to use the words suggested by Bucer, but on the condition that we would not be bound by them and could freely and clearly interpret them according to the reason of our religion and received doctrine. For Bucer assured us that it was not intended to divert us from the Bern Disputation and the long-received opinion on the Lord's Supper to Lutheranism, but only to use them for the sake of concord, as they were more suitable to allure the otherwise very embittered minds of the adversaries. Bucer knows this was done. The acts of the synod also testify to this. However, since those words were admitted by us under the hope of concord, and that hope has failed, those words have undoubtedly vanished into oblivion, or at least they will not be a detriment to the doctrine used in our churches. For the right of interpretation undoubtedly belongs to those who from the beginning received those words only to be explained according to the reason of the doctrine received in the Helvetian churches. Therefore, it is in vain to object to us the Basel Confession, unless the exposition is also granted, which is in all respects conformable to the doctrine retained in our churches from the beginning of the Reformation until now. For if anyone were to impose their own or another's sense on this confession, it would not be accepted by us. Therefore, to commune under the faith of the Basel Confession will be nothing else than to commune under the faith we professed in the last response to Luther. But since that faith does not agree with the faith concerning the Lord's Supper according to Luther's views, our people certainly cannot commune with the Lutherans, unless they are willing to believe one thing in their hearts and profess another outwardly in the celebration of the sacraments. We cannot be advocates for our people to do this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>However, by our abstention, we do not despise you, brothers, nor your church, nor have we ever judged it to be contempt of our church if any guests did not commune with us. Nor have we ever compelled any guest to commune with us against their conscience and profession of faith, but we have never repelled anyone who approached of their own accord.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Therefore, we ask you to allow our young men to enjoy their faith peacefully among you, and not to compel them to do what conflicts with their conscience and faith. For we otherwise like your school, we like the discipline, and we love you and yours, and we desire that our people may associate with you for a time. We wish this to be understood not only of those two of ours but also of others whom, God willing, we will send in the future.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>However, if you think that this request of ours tends to significant offense or harm to your church, we will not only send no more, but the parents of those two who are now with you will not hesitate to recall them. We cannot act otherwise, brothers. For we know whom we have believed, and with God confirming us, we do not doubt our opinion, which is indeed pure and simple. We know how much integrity we must use before God and His church, especially in the profession of faith; hence we strive with all our might not to knowingly sin against the Lord here. We pray that you will receive these things from us, not from bitter minds, but with fair minds, and that you will have peace with us until the Lord grants us to see which teaching is simpler and purer in this matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>What should have been done first, we do last. We give your humanity the greatest thanks for the faith, diligence, and care bestowed upon us. May the Lord, the most generous rewarder of all good things, repay you with the greatest rewards. We also promise you all our faith and diligence, if ever in similar or other matters we can gratify you, and you need our help. The times are indeed grave and afflicted (as you truly write); but our sins deserve even graver. Therefore, let us be brothers in this, that the churches committed to our faith may be called back to perpetual and Christian repentance. The Lord will not reject His people, however sharply He may chastise them. For gold must be tested by fire, we must be sifted, we must confess the name of the Lord even in torments. Let us therefore offer ourselves and all that is ours to the Lord. Let us pray continually that He may never be absent from us, without whom we can do nothing. Truth will ultimately prevail, even if the confessors of truth are defeated in this world. For the judgment of the Lord is drawing near.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Therefore, act manfully against the Antichrist and farewell in Christ, esteemed and beloved brothers and lords.</p>
