      <p>Most Reverend Father in Christ, I have received your letters, from which I have sufficiently understood the reason why you do not wish me to be transferred at this time. But I did not write these things with the intention that it should happen suddenly. I know how disgraceful it would be to flee from the battlefield now, but I hoped that some honorable terms of peace could eventually be reached. But whatever it is, God, who sent me here, in whose paternal mercy I rest, will provide for me when the time comes. May His holy will be done. I have no doubt about the will of the councilors, especially Mr. Müller; but I know that sometimes great hopes die with the people themselves, which is why I firmly look to God. I needed some quiet time to collect myself; therefore, I do not seek busy work and prefer the countryside to the noise of the city. - Concerning our affairs, here is the situation: Maximilian Caesar wrote again quite sharply; but even Beatus himself wrote very imperiously to the captain in Fürstenburg. I must tell you how things went in Fürstenburg, for now all the details are known: 12 men came there, to whom access was given because they called themselves God's house people and offered to guard the castle. These 12 immediately attacked the priest in the castle (this is what they call the bailiff; he is a Salisch, a disreputable, limping man) for the keys. He resisted for a long time; but when he was overpowered, he agreed to open the gates to Lord Batten, who was waiting outside with several horses. These 12 were in distress; they rushed out of the outer gates and shouted to Lord Batten. Meanwhile, the priest closed the other 2 gates (for there are 3 gates) behind them and harassed them from above. Lord Batten was outside, admonished the priest with many words, and made many promises; but all in vain, he finally withdrew, etc. There are otherwise many who say the plan has failed; one might come to better means, etc. I suppose you have now understood from Lord Landammann Bäldi's writings how far our matters have progressed. May God grant grace to it. Next Sunday will again be a God's house day. If the matter comes to fruition, good arbitrators will be necessary; then Lord Landammann Bäldi himself will ride to Zürich, etc. Otherwise, I have nothing from Italy. A great many people are moving there, but it is a poor plunder. We have nothing from the Reichstag. Now nothing more, may God preserve you and yours in all good things. The councilors, Mr. Pontisella, and other friends greet you. Regarding that condition in Flaachtal, I have written nothing to any of my people, so there is no need for you to say anything to them. I do not want to trouble my father-in-law, as he is an old man. You will greet him with my words and say that we are well. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, on the first day of April, in the year 1566.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend father in Christ. Zürich.</p>
