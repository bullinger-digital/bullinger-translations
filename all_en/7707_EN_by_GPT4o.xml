      <p>S. D. I was surprised that you have been silent for so long; but since I understand that you are in good health, I am glad; we are somewhat well here.</p>
      <p>The assembly is now being held in Baden. We do not know what will be decided. Anguissola believes that the Swiss are bound by a hereditary Burgundian alliance to defend Burgundy.</p>
      <p>He has spent a lot of money in the Cantons; however, it is not yet certain what will happen. I hope neither our people nor the Bernese nor other good people will agree to this military campaign.</p>
      <p>What we have is this: There is a rumor coming from many places that the king's army in France has been defeated by Condé's forces. I will wait for the limping messenger.</p>
      <p>From Heidelberg, it was written on November 29th that the Queen of England has sent her envoy to the King of France to inform him that she has so far behaved neutrally and has not allied with Condé.</p>
      <p>However, since many promises were made to Condé and not kept, and the king has allied himself with other potentates against the faith, which she also knows, the king should not be surprised if something happens in the future that he does not expect. The Prince of Orange has announced that he wants and must withdraw from the Netherlands into France. It was not known otherwise, but it is said to be so; he has also set fire to his camp and left as one who flees. However, he secretly left a rearguard. The Spanish pursued, damaged the rearguard, and followed up to the front. There the front broke open, they fell into it, and those withdrawing also turned around and chased each other fiercely and enough around the field. For the prince could not otherwise bring the Duke of Alba out of the camp, but here he was caught by cunning. The prince is said to have lost 200 horses, and Alba almost all his cavalry, up to 34 standards, and a beautiful field gun. The battle took place on November 12th near Bergen. This is also written from St. Gallen, Basel, Strasbourg, Cologne, and Liège. What followed further, we do not yet know. This is told or written as certain; I give it to you as it reached me. May God help us to a good peace.</p>
      <p>The Lord be with you. Greet all our people in order. In great haste, December 17, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>To the pastor at St. Martin in Chur, Mr. Tobias Egli.</p>
