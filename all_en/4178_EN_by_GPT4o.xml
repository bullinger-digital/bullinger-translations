      <p>Absurdities of Brentius and Smidelinus faithfully recorded from their own mouths during the discussions with me in TÃ¼bingen, Bebenhausen, and Stuttgart. Brentius and Smidelinus reject and condemn the saying of Augustine to Dardanus (Remove the spaces of places from bodies, etc.) and many of his and other fathers' sayings that contradict them, labeling them as absurd and false. Brentius and Smidelinus deny, contrary to all of Holy Scripture and the testimonies of the fathers, that the body of Christ is in heaven as in a certain place. Brentius said: Heaven is nowhere, likewise: Heaven, in which the body of Christ is, is everywhere. Smidelinus: The body of Christ is finite and infinite.</p>
      <p>Smidelinus: The right hand of God the Father is the Word itself. Smidelinus: The most absurd place is Philippians, Colossians 3, where it says Christ is in heaven by physical location. Smidelinus: I deny that you have Holy Scripture testifying that the body of Christ is in heaven as in a place. I do not care about the fathers.</p>
      <p>Smidelinus: Heaven is not a place.</p>
      <p>We will all be in God.</p>
      <p>God is our heaven.</p>
      <p>Smidelinus: I deny that Christ the man goes, sits, or stands in heaven; for he fills all things. Smidelinus: Divinity is not everywhere, that is, in all places.</p>
      <p>Likewise: Divinity is not diffused.</p>
      <p>Smidelinus: The body of Christ is everywhere just as divinity is.</p>
      <p>Neither is everywhere locally, but by filling. Smidelinus: The true body of Christ is eaten by the impious according to the saying of David: With the holy, you will be holy; with the perverse, you will be perverted. Smidelinus, when I recited the place of Saint Vigilius (This is the faith and confession of the Catholic), responded: Let me see the book, please. Yes, these words are Bullinger's.</p>
      <p>Brentius: The body of Christ was everywhere and omnipotent from the moment of conception in the womb of the Virgin Mary. Brentius: The authority of Vigilius is nothing to me, you might as well call it a dormitory.</p>
      <p>Brentius: The humanity of Christ sits at the right hand of God, that is, it has all the properties of God; therefore, it is everywhere. Smidelinus: The bread is really and substantially the body of Christ.</p>
      <p>Here I keep the rhetoric most properly and thus explain: The bread is, that is, it exhibits or is exhibited as the body of Christ; for the bread is the instrument by which the body of Christ is exhibited. Brentius and Smidelinus: The whole Christ is inseparably in the supper; therefore, he is present in humanity and divinity. Brentius: I prove the humanity of Christ to be everywhere, 1. because the Word became flesh, 2. because he sits at the right hand of the Father. Smidelinus and Brentius: The humanity of Christ received the Holy Spirit without measure; therefore, it is omnipotent and everywhere. Brentius and Smidelinus: The nature of the devil and God is inseparably joined; thus, the natures of Peter, Paul, and all creatures are inseparably joined with the divine nature; therefore, they are united personally. Smidelinus: The definition of Philippi, which you bring about personal union, is most absurd; the definition is broader; for it can also be applied to the devil. Bidebachus, the court preacher, when I said heaven is not a physical, that is, earthly, place, exclaimed in the assembly: Lords, do not be upset that I interrupt. If anyone says heaven is a place, but not physical, it is as if he says: "It is a wooden fire iron." Brentius: Heaven is a place.</p>
      <p>Then, when I said Christ in John 14 says: In my Father's house are many mansions, and: I go to prepare a place for you, he replied: Indeed, it is an allegorical place. Bidebachus the abbot: Do you think, he said to me, that Christ has such a body in heaven as he had on earth? When I replied: He has exactly the same human body, however spiritual, consisting of its parts and features; indeed, he will show his wounds and scars to his crucifiers and torturers on the last day, he added: Do not believe it. Brentius: The humanity of Christ is everywhere; but if he wants to reveal himself to someone, he becomes finite. Brentius: I keep the rhetoric in the words of Christ: This is my body; yet I admit synecdoche. But you hunt for letters and syllables.</p>
      <p>Smidelinus, when I affirmed and proved to him that the bread is a sacrament, sign, figure, and symbol of the true body of Christ, replied: No, no; the signification does not nourish me. Brentius, turning to Smidelinus: Lord provost, this is how the matter stands.</p>
      <p>You and I have experienced it; each has a wife; the wife says to the maid: Bring me the child to nurse. The maid brings the cradle in which the child is.</p>
      <p>The greater part gives the name.</p>
      <p>Thus, the bread is the body of Christ.</p>
      <p>Schmidelinus: The body of Christ is substantially and really in the supper on this earth, but not locally, quantitatively, qualitatively. Smidelinus: The impious eat the very body of Christ corporally.</p>
      <p>Calvin wrote to me: I am surprised you do not understand that the impious do not eat the body of Christ. I replied to him: I am surprised you do not understand that the impious eat the body of Christ.</p>
      <p>He should still bite on the nut.</p>
      <p>Brentius, once approving a certain confession made for me out of ignorance, approved it again with these words: I acknowledge that I have seen and approved it; again I approve. But I would like it explained more fully, lest the Zwinglian poison lie hidden in it.</p>
      <p>But it is certain that he either never understood it nor understands it even now or acts against his conscience. These and other things, partly absurd, partly blasphemous, which are almost infinite and I willingly now keep silent, I am prepared to show and prove from their own writings at any place and time that they, either through ignorance and imprudence or knowingly, willingly, prudently, truly establish papal dogmas, transubstantiation, consubstantiation, or local inclusion, corporeal or Capernaite eating, etc., however much they deny it in words, likewise the doctrine of heaven (in which the body of Christ now is and we will be) and the true ubiquity or rather annihilation of the body of Christ is entirely new, monstrous, Epicurean, and unknown to all purer antiquity and falsely fortified by the authority of Luther. If I do not demonstrate all these things most fully to competent judges, men of good faith and testimony appointed by the authority of princes for the knowledge of this matter, I will pay the penalty of death by my own judgment. For I am so held by the zeal and desire to cleanse the house of the Lord from filth and to defend the truth (which I say without boasting) that I am almost consumed. Glory to God alone, who continually strengthens me to proceed freely and courageously in propagating his word. To Lord Bullinger be given.</p>
