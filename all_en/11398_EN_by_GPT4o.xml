    <p xml:id="regest1">Received the coat of arms; Bullinger should collect the costs from Hans Jakob [Brennwald]. Emperor [Charles V] and King [Ferdinand I] plan to meet on March 1 [in Brussels]; the Schmalkaldic League has dispatched an embassy there - consisting of [Georg von Boyneburg] from Hesse, [Georg von der Planitz] from Saxony, [Peter Sturm] from Strasbourg, and [Johann Scheyring from Magdeburg]. An attack against the Duchy of Guelders is feared; two armies are ready in case Hesse or Saxony are attacked. He has applied for his release on April 23 and wishes to move to Zurich; however, his lord [Count Georg of Württemberg] wants to keep him for another year. He asks to greet [Diethelm] Röist and to pass on political news to him; also greetings to Bullinger's colleagues and family. His son Hans, who is still with him, will soon be fever-free; [Simon] Grynaeus has promised to take him in. Vogler will only receive an honorable farewell from his lord, who is very displeased, if he stays for another year. His [son-in-law?] will travel again [from Zurich to Riquewihr] in a month; he asks Bullinger for a few lines.</p>

      <p>My friendly, willing service.</p>
      <p>Friendly, dear lord and benefactor, first you should know that I have received the coat of arms, although I cannot give it to the place where I would like; the design is good, but somewhat poorly executed. However, I will distribute it, and whatever it costs, Hans Jakob, my son-in-law, will give it to you.</p>
      <p>Secondly, in trust (although I assume you already partly know), someone has informed me of recent news, first briefly, that on the border on the first of March, the Emperor and King are supposed to meet, therefore the protesting Schmalkaldic states have decided to send representatives to him, as they are coming; he wants to hear them, and has promised them peace until this hearing, etc. In response, the Protestants have appointed four envoys, namely one from the Landgrave, the second from Duke Hans, the third from Strasbourg, I hear Jacob Sturm's brother, and a fourth from Sestatt, with the instruction, as I hear, not only to answer, but also to find out from the Emperor what they should expect in the future. And although an attack on Guelders is feared, which is not abandoned, as soldiers are daily accepted in the Emperor's name and move down, it is, as I truly believe, prepared, so that if Hesse is attacked, an army is stationed there to save it, and if Saxony is attacked, the other army is well prepared there. Moreover, Saxony and Hesse themselves want to be over the troops; in this may God be the Lord. Amen.</p>
      <p>You should also know that I have recently taken a gracious leave from my gracious prince, planning to move to you on St. George's Day, if the Lord God allows it. The Lord guides my decisions. My gracious lord is not satisfied with my leave, and my wife, who is sick, does not want to stay, etc. He is very displeased, urging me strongly to serve him for another year.</p>
      <p>Wishing to convey my greetings to my lord Röist along with the news from me, and to all good lords, Lord Provost, Leon, Caspar, Theodor, Master Rasmus, Thumysen, Andreas Gessner, Master Kaspar, as much as possible (when you walk on the street), greet them, also Laffater, especially your wife and children.</p>
      <p>My son Hans is still with me; I hope the fever has left him these days. Grynaeus has promised to take him in; I believe I will send him to him. Acted.</p>
      <p>As I, as mentioned above, have taken leave from my gracious prince, he is so harsh (fierce, displeased), demanding from my wife and me with many sharp words that I serve him for another year to a gracious farewell (in my opinion, since I am with love and grace there, I must serve for another year, may the dear God protect and guide me), as the world events are wild and cause great concern. My son will probably return in a month. So write to me whether it is rich or poor.</p>
      <p>Acted on the 4th of February, 1540.</p>
      <p>Your willing Johann Vogler, steward at</p>
      <p>Riquewihr.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, honorable M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my faithful lord and friend.</p>
