      <p>Greetings. Safe and sound, I have returned to my family; I found them also safe by the grace of the Lord. I am very grateful to all of you for your kindness and benevolence.</p>
      <p>If only I could see you here sometime and repay you for the benefits you continually bestow upon me. Eight days after I returned, my wife presented me with our seventh child.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, there is nothing to write about now; everything is wonderfully silent, and nothing new is reported, except that some are whispering something about a peace agreement between the Emperor and the French. If this proceeds, our church, along with the kingdom of England, will also be in danger. May the Lord be with us with His grace and scatter the plans of the wicked. Amen. May all your loved ones be safe along with our dearest brothers. All of ours send their greetings to you. I hear from some in Geneva that there is a debate about whether the children of the excommunicated should be baptized or not; thus, there is always something new from that Africa. Bern, June 6, 1554.</p>
      <p>Please send this letter to those it concerns, I pray. Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord and compatriot, to be greatly honored.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
