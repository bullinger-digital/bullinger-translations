      <p>Greetings. I am experiencing, though at present not gladly, my most illustrious Mr. Bullinger, how dangerous a thing it is to trust any of the brothers, even those professing faith. A certain Johannes Ewich from Host, in the diocese of Cologne, a doctor of medicine, who had recently come from Italy and stayed for several days with Dr. Gesner in Z端rich, and was also (as he himself reported) most honorably received by you learned men, traveled with me by ship from Basel to Strasbourg. He is otherwise well-versed in Greek and Latin and not ignorant of true Christian doctrine and (as it seemed) devoted to piety, with a noble appearance, honest manners, pleasant conversation, and in sum (as it seemed) a good man, very respectful of all the people of Z端rich and especially of you and Mr. Gesner. For these reasons, I honored him with what respect I could both at my home and outside.</p>
      <p>Therefore, to him, as I could not doubt his faith, I entrusted the letters you had commended to me, which contained some money, and what you had instructed me verbally, I committed to him in writing, namely, if he found Mr. Johannes Pistorius in Worms (for he said he was going there directly to visit those learned men), he should deliver both letters to him, but if not, he should deliver the one addressed to Mr. Pistorius to Vulcan, and ensure the other addressed to Mr. Hyperius was delivered by some trustworthy messenger.</p>
      <p>Then he was to write to me about the whole matter, so that I might inform you in full detail. Indeed, Dr. Marpachius (for he was here at that time) had given him letters to Melanchthon. He promised to deliver them and departed.</p>
      <p>However, if he was in Worms, he certainly did not deliver Marpachius's letters to Philip (as is most certain) nor was he seen by Philip, and he wrote nothing back to me, so that I doubt whether your letters were delivered either. I cannot express how much this matter pains me; it would pain me even more if I could redeem your letters with money at the cost of my own pain, or if I were not convinced that you, with your prudence, would interpret my imprudence and excessive trust in a better light. I would say, if the money with the letters was not delivered: I will repay the money, unless I feared that, while wanting to appear generous, I might incur some just reproach from you. Therefore, I ask at least for your forgiveness.</p>
      <p>Regarding the dissolved colloquy and matters pertaining to it, I believe you have been informed from elsewhere and abundantly, so it is unnecessary for me to write anything to you about this matter. You will understand this from me: Dr. Marpachius has returned better and has shown me many signs of friendship, also promising many things, especially regarding the ubiquity of the body of Christ... that he will not contradict me in the future, allowing each to follow their own opinion on the sacramental matter, and he has provided some example of this.</p>
      <p>For he favored the English and interceded for them with the senate, so that they might be allowed to remain, etc. I do not doubt that Philip has done good service with him, and if he continues thus, I hope well for both our school and church. May the Lord favor us and all his churches.</p>
      <p>I greet your most honorable wife and your entire household church. Strasbourg, December 30, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Hieronymus Zanchus. To the most illustrious pastor of the Z端rich church, Mr. Bullinger, (lord) and most revered father. Z端rich.</p>
