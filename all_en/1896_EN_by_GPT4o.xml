      <p>Greetings. Four days ago, through Richard Hill, your letter dated March 9th was first delivered to me, most illustrious man; in which you inform me that you have recovered from the deadly illness you were suffering from around December, for which I am most glad: and I pray to the Lord to strengthen your health and keep you safe for a long time for His church, to the glory of His name. I too was very dangerously ill in the same month, so much so that all the brothers, and even Mr. a Lasco, my host, completely despaired of my life. However, by God's mercy, I have been moderately restored to my former health. May the Lord grant that I may use it for the advancement of His kingdom according to my ability. Furthermore, regarding your complaint about Mr. Hoper's negligence, I am not surprised, but rather I am surprised at the man's negligence. I will certainly admonish him soon with my letters, and that seriously. But what I will achieve, I do not know: for he is so disposed that he never writes to any of us, not even to Mr. a Lasco, although he loves us in the meantime, so much so that your complaints are common to all of us with you.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I would like you to be firmly convinced that Bullinger is always dearest to him, and that he is held in the highest regard among all men, which I can certainly attest to. As for the money that Hoper lent to those students you mentioned, I will learn from Hoper himself what he wants to be done with it, and if I receive any response from him, I will inform you immediately.</p>
      <p>Mr. a Lasco, who is still with us, sends his regards to you, and promised me yesterday that he would write to you; therefore, I will write nothing more about him now, not doubting that he will keep his promise. In terms of news, we have nothing except that the king, who was suffering very dangerously from a severe cough that had already occupied his innermost parts and very marrow, is now better: although it is hardly likely that his health will be fully restored this entire summer. In the meantime, however, he has always been very well disposed towards religion, and still is, much more than ever before.</p>
      <p>May God preserve him for His church, and I ask that you commend him to God with your prayers there. Now, articles are being printed in the king's name, which must be subscribed to by all who are to be established in the ministry, and even those already established, if they wish to retain their ministry. Furthermore, what I asked two years ago, I ask you again in the Lord, that you, or someone else (if it is not burdensome), ensure that a large book not seasoned with much spice, like the one you sent to Burcher four years ago, is sent to me from there to the Frankfurt fair. It could easily be arranged for me to receive it from the Frankfurt fair through the hands of Richard Hill: by which you would do me a favor greater than I can express to you. You can inform me of the price: I will give it to Mr. Hoper as a reduction of the money we mentioned earlier, or I will pay it in another way, as you wish. If I can ever do anything in return for you, please use me familiarly.</p>
      <p>Mr. Martin Micronius sends you many greetings. Please greet Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Gesner, and Mr. Butler for me, to whom I wish better health in the Lord. Farewell, most illustrious man, always to be honored in my mind in Christ, to whom I commend you and your ministry from the heart: and love me, as you are accustomed. London, June 7, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours as his own, Jan Utenhove.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his brother and most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
