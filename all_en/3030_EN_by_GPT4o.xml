      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. The son of Erasmus Fabritius (of blessed memory) came to me, a young man quite well-mannered; but I did not have the opportunity to converse with him more nor to show the duties of courtesy either to him or to the students who are associated with him; for the synod, which is to be held the next day, did not allow it. There were certain contentious brothers present, whose matters I wished to settle first. He was concerned about his sister, desiring to know where she was, which I do not know. For the previous year she had been at Riquewihr with a most impious mass-priest, who, if it is true, took a little son from her, etc. I hear that the Apocalypse is being sold everywhere and published by you, but we have not seen it. If it is true, make sure that no less than ten copies are sent to us by the printer, I will be the guarantor. The prince did not respond to the gift sent to him; perhaps you received something from Montbéliard. There are those who say we are Zwinglians in Strasbourg because we use your ecclesiastical order; but we do not care for those who now are or wish to appear as leaders of that church. Peace has so far been established with the former ministers of the church, therefore we now treat those contentious and slanderous ones as equals. It is not permitted to write more due to business, perhaps more another time.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet the family and brothers. Pray for us. October 6, 1556.</p>
      <p>[Yours] Erb.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, especially in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, supreme Antistes of the renowned city of Zürich among the Swiss, to be respected, etc.</p>
