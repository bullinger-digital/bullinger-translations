      <p>Greetings. I received your letter two days ago, dearest godfather in the Lord, along with those you sent to Brenz regarding the issue of ubiquity, for which I am very grateful to you. He has not only hardened his own mind but also that of the prince himself in this doctrine, so there is no hope of him ever thinking correctly about it. In the meantime, you are doing the right thing by responding to him with your writings and also looking out for the salvation of the less knowledgeable, so they are not led away from the simplicity of faith by such a harmful doctrine. As for my "Antilogia Abraham," you wisely advise that the parts concerning the preachers of Augsburg at the end should be omitted; please take care of this with your diligence when it is submitted to the press. Regarding the Council of Trent, where the Antichrist will forge thunderbolts to attack the churches of Christ, I feel exactly the same as you. There is no doubt that the holy fathers are preparing to sanctify war against us; for they have been laboring over this for a long time. The outcome of these labors is in God's hands.</p>
      <p>As for me, I fear not so much their plans as our own dissensions; I see it is very difficult to remove the animosities of our princes and magistrates, through which it happens that each republic is either secure in relying on its own strength or, if it seeks any counsel, does so in such a way that it does not wish the others to be aware. We see our adversaries sharing their plans with each other, meanwhile, what about us? We are, of course, waiting for the moment of necessity and peril. May the Lord open the eyes of those who are slumbering, so they may see, and the hearts of those who are secure, so they may understand and look out for both public and their own affairs with somewhat more Christian prudence. I hear the Duke of Savoy's envoy was there with you; perhaps he is using the same tactics Charles used when he was planning war against us.</p>
      <p>May the Lord scatter the plans of the princes!</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently.</p>
      <p>Greet all yours along with friends and brothers. Our Johannes Heinrich reverently greets you.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 15, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Musculus in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian, Heinrich Bullinger, dearest godfather and brother.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
