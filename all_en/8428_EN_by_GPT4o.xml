      <p>Greetings. I have nothing to write at the moment, dear brother, except that I am sending you the enclosed letters from our dear Rampius, which I received from him for you to handle. I have not received anything worth mentioning from friends for several days; if I receive anything in the future, I will gladly share it. I do mention, however, that the king wanted to have the Swiss guard, as they call it, for the splendor of the wedding. However, the principal advisors dissuaded him, lest the princes interpret it as a move to violate the peace with the admiral. When the king considered this, he decided not to invite anyone to the wedding. On October 22, the emperor's daughter was betrothed to Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria, the king of the French, in Speyer; then she was taken to France accompanied by the Elector of Trier, the Bishop of Strasbourg, Margrave Charles of Baden, and many counts and nobles. The bride of the King of Spain, beyond all expectations, was received with great pomp and 12 large warships by the Queen of England in the English Channel and was honorably escorted to the port of Biscay.</p>
      <p>In this regard, the Spanish were greatly delighted, and the Spanish royal family sent gifts to the Queen of England. Everyone is amazed that, with matters between England and Spain not yet settled, the English have bestowed such honor upon their enemy; but the more prudent attribute this to the exceptional wisdom of the Queen of England, etc. The Diet of Speyer will soon conclude, if it has not already. The emperor has obtained a good sum of money from the empire. There is much to be done, otherwise little has been accomplished. Today is the eighth day since I sent you the letters along with Beza's book, which refutes the pamphlets of Brentius and other academics arguing that heretics should not be punished. You will return it to me safely once you have used it. I assume you have not written this week due to your fairs and the business that Ganthner imposes on you, himself, and others. I wish to know what is happening or what has happened. May the Lord bless you and your labors.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 17, in the year of our salvation 1570. Greet both consuls, Mr. Charles, Pontisella, Bonet, and others.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur in the Grisons, my kind lord and brother. Chur.</p>
