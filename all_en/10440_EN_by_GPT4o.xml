    <p xml:id="regest1">Ludwig von Diesbach praised Bullinger's friendliness after his return from Zurich, but did not bring a letter from him. Haller is pleased with the military successes in Württemberg, but he only fears that Lutheran preachers will be forced upon the reconquered duchy. A letter from Jakob Otter from Esslingen and the experiences of the preacher from Birmenstorf and Gebenstorf, Michael Tuberius?, with the army of Landgrave Philipp of Hesse reinforced this. Leo Jud drew his attention to Bucer's writing "to the people of Münster" "Report..."; Haller asks for Bullinger's opinion on it. He believes that in the doctrine of the Lord's Supper represented therein, Bucer is moving away from Zwingli. When the next part of Bullinger's commentary on the Corinthian letters is printed, the messenger will bring it along; Bullinger should not be burdened with it. Megander's commentary on the Epistle to the Ephesians has been published in Basel. In Bern, the church and state are doing well. They are searching for traitors from the Second Kappel War. There is fear of misfortune from Bern's actions due to the outstanding Waldshut tithe. Haller is preaching on the Acts of the Apostles; the Epistle to the Hebrews is being studied together with others. Greetings.</p>

      <p>S. The noble Ludwig von Diesbach reported how much kindness you showed him, so much so that words seemed to fail in praising it as desired. However, when I asked for your letters, my dearest Heinrich, he always replied that you were perhaps absent from home due to business and had forgotten about it.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new with us, except for the rumors about the war in Württemberg. The success, according to human judgment, is pleasing, but what greatly displeases me, and indeed I fear it uniquely with Jakob Otter from Esslingen, whose letter dated June 10th I received shortly, is that Lutheran preachers might be imposed on the duchy. For one of ours, who was also with you for a while, Michael, a soap maker, formerly a monk at Alpersbach with Blaurer, recently a preacher at Birmenstorf and Gebenstorf, who in these days followed the prince and the army but could not be heard - when he tried to approach the prince's preachers of Hesse, who are said to be four, the best of them dissuaded him. As soon as they heard that he had preached the gospel among the Swiss, they would not acknowledge him as a brother nor admit him. Furthermore, he reported that there is a rumor throughout Württemberg of a future disputation, especially with Luther himself. But what can be achieved with such a man? Therefore, if you have also learned anything about these matters, I beg you, do not let them remain hidden from me.</p>
      <p>Leo Jud recommended Bucer's booklet to the people of Münster. When you read his opinion almost at the end about the Eucharist and what is principal in the Lord's Supper, let me hear your judgment. For he absolutely wants the true body of Christ and similarly the blood to be offered to the faithful in the Supper through word and sacraments, not that it is united with the bread naturally, really, or corporally, but just as contracts and promises in external matters are made not only by consent but also by words and sacraments (as when right hands are joined, letters are sealed, etc.), so also in this celebration of the Supper. Then the thanksgiving, which Zwingli placed everywhere in the first place, he attributes to the latter and wants to be able to repair the concord among us with all these things.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I do not doubt that some things in the Corinthians are finally completed in the press. If there are any and it can be done by the grace of the printer, let the messenger bring them to me. However, I do not want to burden you. For whatever of yours has been published with you so far, Christophorus sent. You also sent as a gift, as if you were not, more than is appropriate, daily burdened with my affairs and questions.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Petri in Basel published Megander's commentaries on the Ephesians, which Miconius indeed sent to you. One observes the other in a remarkable way, but I wish, "let all things be done for edification" [1 Cor 14:26].</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we are all in the highest, unless I am mistaken, hypocrisy, concord. The senate and the church are well. Every day they seek the imposture and treason of the past calamitous war. As soon as the matter comes out, it will not be hidden from you. As the messenger goes to you, others are sent to all the districts. I fear we will comfort ourselves with others' fortune and load our own misfortune on our necks with the outstanding tithe to Waldshut. From yours, you will understand the effort of our people, which I certainly do not know. What I wrote recently, the consul ordered, but I hear it happened quite differently. The Lord knows why he governs all things differently than we wish, namely that we may look to him alone. In summary: However, we teach trust in one God. Yet the flesh always inclines to the flesh.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most learned and dearest Heinrich. I am now dealing with the Acts of the Apostles for the sermon, and we are also discussing the Epistle to the Hebrews for the colloquium. There I observe whom each one imitates; but about these things another time.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>July 3, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin.</p>
      <p>See that this messenger does not come to me empty-handed. Greetings to Leo, Pellicanus, Theodorus, Werner Steiner, and all the learned ones.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his especially beloved lord and brother.</p>
