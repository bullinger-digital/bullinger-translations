      <p>Greetings a thousand times again and again, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother in Christ. I have been absent from Winterthur for almost an entire month, from which I happily returned three days ago with the good angels of the Lord as my companions, having successfully completed the business in the Palatinate for which I had undertaken the journey. Meanwhile, neither in Ulm nor in Biberach nor in other cities, where almost 30 years ago there was some use of the ministry of the church by the grace of my lord, did I find anything that greatly delighted me, but countless things that greatly saddened my spirit; such is the pitiable transformation of all things, whether you consider the preachers, the magistrates, or the common people, and such is the defection from the truth of that former purer religion. Certainly, I could scarcely recognize even the smallest traces of the previous state; everything everywhere is so corrupted by either papal or other foreign doctrines. I could never have been led to believe that in so few years so much papal superstition would again break forth.</p>
      <p>Ah, Savior Christ, what will those who remain see after another thirty years from now! How great will be the barbarism, how great the desolation and confusion of all fluctuating things! But first, I hope, that great day of Christ will come, which will lead us, drawn from the whirlpool of these evils, into the long-hoped-for and blessed inheritance of heavenly glory. I greatly desire to learn something certain from you about the affairs of France.</p>
      <p>In Swabia itself, even more uncertain things are spread among great men, so that I am not inclined to write anything about them at all.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my venerable and more than dearest Bullinger, with your entire household, which I rightly judge to be the temple of the Lord, and I uniquely desire to be made a perpetual participant in the sacrifices and offerings of your lips. Greet all the brothers and friends, especially the fellow ministers, whom the Lord may strengthen with His Holy Spirit, so that they may be able to withstand the severe storms that threaten our heads. From Winterthur, whence tomorrow I will again set out for Grie√üenberg and thence to my brother Vultureius, soon to return. September 17, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in doctrine and religion, Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed lord and friend, and dearest brother in Christ.</p>
