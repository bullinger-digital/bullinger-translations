    <p xml:id="regest1">The learned and unblemished Zurich pastor Konrad Klauser is on his way to Isny, where he will serve as a pastor if he is well-received. As a herald of the Swabian church, Blarer should advise and further recommend him. - On October 11, a diet will take place in Baden, where the bad behavior of the governor of Milan [Alfonso d'Avalos] towards Swiss citizens, who were held captive by him for a while, will be discussed. The evangelical places must also consider how to respond to an invitation to join the Schmalkaldic League. - Duke Charles [II] of Orléans is said to have died of poisoning. [Francis I] is likely enduring a similar fate as [King] Jeroboam, who lost his son Nadab.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. Finally, a minister has been appointed to the church in Isny, this is Mr. Konrad Klauser from Zurich, who is now being sent to be heard, in case he might be pleasing. He is a man learned in Greek and Latin, well-read, sufficiently knowledgeable in the scriptures, of upright life, and from childhood has been instructed in good and pious studies by the best teachers. He places his chief hope, after Christ, in your affection and faith. Therefore, I commend this man to you, so that you may instruct him on how he can conduct himself with great benefit in that church. You indeed know this, if anyone does, as the first herald of the gospel throughout Swabia. Otherwise, he is kind and faithful, steadfast and hardworking, and will not be ungrateful for your efforts. If it seems useful, recommend him also to your friends through letters. A diet will be held by the Swiss in Baden on October 11. The governor of Milan, Alfonso d'Avalos, has completely failed our bailiffs beyond the mountain in all purchases. He commits some unfriendly acts (actions) against our people and their bailiffs. He captured some of our people on our land, but after a long time, he let them go, etc. The evangelical cities will also discuss separately how they should respond if they are urged to join the Schmalkaldic League, etc. They say that Duke Charles II of Orléans, whom the Swiss raised from the sacred font, has died in France, not without suspicion of poison, from which many rightly fear new disturbances. I truly feel that Jeroboam must see the fate of his Nadab and soon follow it. May the Lord Jesus keep us!</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 4, 1545.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, his incomparable brother. Constance.</p>
