    <p xml:id="regest1">[The pastors of Basel] have responded to Leo [Jud] and enclosed a copy of their letter to the people of Bern; Myconius strongly disapproves of their intention to have Bucer's writings banned, even though he himself would have reason to complain about Bucer's "Retraction." He sends a copy of the [Strasbourg] opinion [on the agenda of the Schmalkalden meeting]. He considers Bullinger's criticism of Zwick's proposal [for a conditional acceptance of the Augsburg Confession] to be unjustified. He asks him to exert a moderating influence on the fellow officials [in Bern].</p>

      <p>Leo (Jud) wrote to the brothers, to which they responded. I think that he will also read to you what we have written. We have added what we sent with our own messenger to Bern. These have the reason that Gaspar announced that he is in favor of having Bucer's books banned in the Bernese territory. Indeed, I have never heard anything more miserable. If their mind, I mean the brothers', not the senate's, is like this, I consider them to have been driven to madness. May the Lord God help us, so that he does not allow men who have been evangelical until now to be so demented. There is no one who could complain more about Bucer's Retraction than I, regarding Zwingli, the Epistolary, and certain secret matters discussed there. However, let it not be that I am moved or complain about these things, as long as the rest tend towards the truth of concord. For what is there that our confession does not have or that has not been proposed to us? And in which we have not agreed, even not rashly. But about these things, another time.</p>
      <p>I am sending the consultation, which my Gastius copied for himself. You see, therefore, how these pertain to the booklet. Therefore, be careful not to sprinkle even a stain or, when you send it back (which must be done shortly), not to entrust it safely. For it would have to be considered by me if you had sinned.</p>
      <p>Regarding Zwick's advice, I ask you to deliberate better; you are entirely wrong if you wish to proceed in this way. You will see this freedom sometime, namely what reason it has. Meanwhile, take it in good part.</p>
      <p>I beg you, my Bullinger, do not allow, as much as it is in you, your brothers to be so carried away by emotions. Let truth, truth guide us, let emotions go where they deserve.</p>
      <p>Farewell always with yours. I could not write more.</p>
      <p>Basel, February 24, in the year 37.</p>
      <p>Your Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest in the Lord.</p>
