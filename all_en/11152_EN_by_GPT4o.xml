    <p xml:id="regest1">Inquires together with Erasmus [Ritter] about the rumor that Basel, out of fear of conflict, is reluctant to meet and instead wants to present its own draft for the response to Luther; urges caution towards Basel and Strasbourg. Distrusts Ritter after his failure [in the dispute over the catechism], but acknowledges his steadfastness in the disputes over the Vogt of Bipp and the pastor of Kirchlindach, Erhard [Lindenfels]. Venner [Im Haag] will report on the chairmen of the Anabaptist disputation, which begins on [March 11]; [Simon] Sulzer was called to Bern for this. Needs more information about his future position before he can take his leave.</p>

      <p>Greetings and best wishes.</p>
      <p>A rumor has spread here that the people of Basel are inclined not to hold a meeting of the Swiss churches regarding the response to be given to Luther, and this is supposedly to avoid conflicts (as they claim). However, to ensure that Luther is not entirely disregarded, they are said to have composed a draft response and wish to share it with other churches, so that if the response is approved by all of us, it will be sent to Luther. If you have any definite information on this matter, Erasmus and I would like you to share it with us. If you have not heard anything of the sort, we urge you to be more vigilant in averting the schemes of the people of Basel and Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>I think Erasmus should neither be fully trusted nor distrusted. Why should he be given complete trust when his sudden lapse stands in the way? However, the reason I do not entirely distrust him is due to two significant examples he provided after Megander's departure. When the case of the Vogt of Bipp was being discussed before the senate, he strongly opposed Doctor Sebastian and Kunz on the ineffable manner of the Lord's presence in the supper and does not agree with them to this day. The second example was given recently in the consistory and colloquy; when a good brother from the Bernese countryside named Gerhard, the parish priest of the church of Kirchlindach, was in danger over the sacramental matter and a just cause, he vigorously supported him in both instances and defended him despite the severe displeasure of his colleagues. Therefore, I believe the man should be gradually raised from his lapse, and we should frequently remind ourselves of Paul's saying: "Let him who stands take heed lest he fall" and Seneca's: "What happens to one can happen to all in a similar case."</p>
      <p>The disputation with the Anabaptists will begin next Monday. Our Venner Sepinus will inform you who will preside over it. Sulzer, while I was writing this, had already arrived on the very day he was summoned by our senate for the disputation.</p>
      <p>I would like to be informed as soon as possible about my recall, so that I may be written to about where, for what purpose, with what salary, and in what manner I am to be called and supported, and how soon I am to be recalled. For unless I am thoroughly informed by you about each of these matters, it does not seem in my interest to request permission to leave from the senate, and even if I were to do so, I would not know what to dispose of and sell here, since I am unaware of what I can do without there according to the conditions and what I cannot.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, March 7 (in which the tenth year is now being completed since I first reached this city) in the year 1538.</p>
      <p>Johannes Rhellikan.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished men, Heinrich Bullinger and Caspar Megander, leaders of the church of Zurich, their friends and patrons in the Lord to be respected.</p>
