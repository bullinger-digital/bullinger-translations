    <p xml:id="regest1">He has already written about why he traveled to Regensburg; here he associates with men like Draconites, Corvinus, Pistorius, and Melander, which is certainly in Bullinger's interest. Reports on the journey in the entourage of Prince [Philipp] of Hesse and the reception in Würzburg and Nuremberg as well as by [the Counts Palatine] Friedrich and Philipp. In Regensburg, the Hessian prince was greeted by Duke Christoph of Württemberg and Prince Wolfgang of Anhalt as well as by the imperial negotiator [Nicolas Perrenot?]; his appearance before Emperor [Charles V], where he presented his stance and attacked Duke Heinrich of Brunswick, made a strong impression; in his lodging, he has sermons preached daily, but he does not want to challenge the Emperor by holding public sermons. According to his proposition of April 5, the Emperor aims for religious unification, defense against the Turks, and the restitution of Duke [Charles III] of Savoy; the Swiss should be on guard. Gwalther relies on access to documents; he does not yet know the response of the Protestants, which is yet to be delivered. Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria considers [the Catholic estates] to be too willing to compromise. The Turks are besieging Pest, and [King] Ferdinand is asking for help, which could shorten the Diet; the Turkish threat benefits the Protestants. Much is expected from the Emperor, but he is surrounded by clergy with papal sympathies. Also present are the Bishop of Winchester [Stephen Gardiner], Cardinal [Gasparo] Contarini, who allegedly, unlike the Bishop of Modena [Giovanni Morone], wants to avoid bloodshed, an envoy from Venice [Francesco Contarini], the Lord of Velly [Claude Dodieu] as the French envoy, and the Duke of Savoy; the Emperor relies on the Germans due to the relationship with France, unrest in Spain, and the Turkish threat; the opponents represent varying degrees of hardline positions, but the Turkish threat forces them to make concessions. 18 Spaniards and a sodomitic priest from Italy have been drowned, more are likely to follow. The conflict over Duke Heinrich of Brunswick occupies everyone; Gwalther has composed satirical poems about him. He must break off now and apologizes for the disordered report. Greetings; Draconites asks to be written to.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I wrote to you, most kind father, from Marburg, explaining why I traveled to Regensburg, and I believe that my decision will not displease you or other learned men. Here, I associate with men whose company can make me both wiser and better. They are Dr. Johannes Draconites, Dr. Antonius Corvinus, Pistorius, and Dionysius Melander, whose erudition I know pleases you, and I do not doubt that my association with them will also delight you.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I do not wish to write plainly about my decision. I am one who always desires to benefit my country both in words and in deeds. You are more interested in the news here. I would certainly write more to you if everything were as certain as many things are.</p>
      <p>However, you should know that we, along with the most illustrious Prince of Hesse, left Marburg on the fifteenth and arrived in Regensburg on the 27th of the same month. Although certain things happened on the journey, not all are worth writing about. Our prince traveled with 300 well-equipped and armed horsemen.</p>
      <p>When he arrived in Würzburg, he was received most kindly by the bishop and was hosted at the bishop's expense for two full days. In Nuremberg, he saw the same kindness, but with even greater honor and splendor. However, Duke Friedrich, Prince of Bavaria, surpassed all, who, even in his absence, allowed his deputies to treat the prince as if he himself were present in his castle, where all of us who traveled with the prince were also invited. The same kindness was seen the next day with Philipp, Duke of Bavaria, who was wounded by our prince in the Württemberg war. Everything turned out most happily.</p>
      <p>When we arrived in Regensburg, Duke Christoph of Württemberg and Count of Anhalt rode out to meet our prince. As soon as the prince entered his lodging, the emperor's envoy was present to congratulate his arrival and announced free access to the emperor.</p>
      <p>The Hessian prince visited the emperor the next day and, in a long speech, recounted his obedience and his spirit towards the Christian church, finally attacking Duke Heinrich of Brunswick, promising to prove him a liar, traitor, and impious, and the author of all the fires throughout Germany. He did all this with such constancy of face and words that he drew all the nobles of the imperial court into admiration of him. Here, he is certainly shown the highest honor by all; everyone admires and loves him. He listens to a sacred sermon in his lodging daily, to which many citizens flock. The prince often wanted the sermon to be held in the public temple; but he fears that this importunity might alienate the emperor's mind, which he now seems to have bound to himself.</p>
      <p>On the fifth of April, the emperor first entered the court, and then the proposition of the diet was presented, the summary of which is: 1. to bring the matter of religion into true concord, 2. to resist the Turks; 3. almost everywhere it is secretly mixed in that the Duke of Savoy should be restored. Beware, Switzerland, and see that you are protected by the Lord's help.</p>
      <p>I write all this not from hearsay, but having read it from the original document. Therefore, my credibility in this matter should not be lacking. The Christian princes have prepared a response in these days, which I have not yet been able to see, as it has not yet been presented to the emperor.</p>
      <p>Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria did not want to enter the council of the papists, as he saw them wavering; for he is of such a mind that even if the emperor and all others yield, he himself does not want to yield.</p>
      <p>Besides, I do not know much new, except that the Turk is in arms with a great force of soldiers. He besieges Pest, a city opposite Buda; but a larger army in arms follows. Ferdinand anxiously implores help, and because of this, I hardly hope for the diet to last long. Perhaps the Turk will obtain from the Christian princes what not even an angel from heaven could obtain. Although there is great hope in the emperor, you know how he is surrounded by a retinue, namely of priests, who always present other papist arguments to his ears. God alone must be prayed to, to enlighten his mind, so that he does not lend his ears to the words of such seducers.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Winchester is here, the envoy of the King of England, a fraudulent man and worthy of such a king. There are many legations from foreign nations present.</p>
      <p>Cardinal Contarini is here for the pope, whom all the monks and priests here went out to meet when he entered Regensburg.</p>
      <p>Contarini himself made so many crosses that I think his arm must have been fatigued for two days. It is said of him that he wishes to overthrow us without bloodshed, and in this matter, he is a vigorous advisor. The Bishop of Modena, however, is entirely bloodthirsty, breathing flames and swords. The Venetians have their envoy, a splendid and excellent man. From the King of France comes Lord Vely. The Duke of Savoy is present here as a member of the Roman Empire, praying to recover his dominions, although he never wanted to acknowledge the Roman Empire when he held his dominions. The emperor seems to be planning nothing, as he sees his affairs entangled; for with the French, peace is doubtful or nonexistent, there are seditions in Spain, and the Turk is also attacking. Therefore, he desires Germany to be on his side. The Christian princes wish their cause to be heard and strive for it.</p>
      <p>The opponents are of three minds: There are those who breathe war; there are those who want peace of any kind, provided nothing in religion is changed; there are also those who can tolerate some transformation of the church. What more can I say? If the Turk were not pressing, not much good hope would shine; but since he is pressing and the emperor is trying to draw the landgrave (although not unwilling) to undertake the Turkish expedition in the name of the empire, the papists are forced to make some concessions.</p>
      <p>Finally, everything here is full of Spaniards, but they are diminishing, as they are sometimes accustomed to being thrown from the bridge into the Danube, of whom 18 have already been thrown, and others are expected to follow. This week, an Italian priest, who had relations with his mule, was thrown from the bridge at night by the emperor's order.</p>
      <p>There is nothing else here, except that we are all very occupied with the business of the most wicked scoundrel, Duke Heinrich of Brunswick. If there were more leisure, I would send you more poems that I have written about him. For he is indeed worthy of being made immortal with infamy.</p>
      <p>I cannot write more now, although I have more to say, because I have just been informed of this message at the very last moment. You, most dear father, will kindly and favorably consider my negligence, which you see in these letters; for I preferred to write many things indisposed rather than nothing.</p>
      <p>Draconites, Corvinus, Pistorius, and Melander send you their most dutiful greetings. Furthermore, Draconites, my most kind patron and benefactor, asks that you do not disdain to address him with your letters; he will respond to the letters you write. Farewell, my father, and continue to support me as you are accustomed.</p>
      <p>Regensburg, April 11, 1541.</p>
      <p>Your most observant</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed father. To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger. [Zurich]</p>
