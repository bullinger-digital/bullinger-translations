      <p>Greetings and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>The priests, with whom we have had a long dispute, are triumphant in their judgment, although they are not carried on white horses because they have obtained a verdict against us from your people. It is certainly amazing that those who deceive the whole world with such cunning can be in such favor. How great is the blindness of the world, that it perpetually loves darkness instead of light and embraces falsehood instead of truth. But we shall see what will happen. For although we are not as we ought to be, we still confess the word of God, and that without tumult or offense to anyone. If, after our patience, the Lord will have mercy on us, a helper in time, the priests will feel how intolerable it is to fall into the hands of the Lord.</p>
      <p>The Pope and the Emperor are ready to hold a council, but not under any conditions other than those that serve their own interests, namely that they are the actors, witnesses, and judges.</p>
      <p>Unfortunate things are reported about the King of France, if they are true, namely that the Gospel of Christ has been preached by his authority for some time. If it is a fable, may it become history; if it is history, may the Lord confirm it with the heavenly spirit.</p>
      <p>You may have learned from Strasbourg what monsters that Melchior Hoffman is producing. May the Lord Jesus Christ protect himself against the most harmful and all kinds of sects, and may he also protect - for he is safe enough himself - all those who have given their name to his righteousness, that they may be saved by this alone. Amen.</p>
      <p>These things briefly and hastily, lest I seem to have completely forgotten you.</p>
      <p>I commend myself to your prayers, your brother, and especially the church of Konstanz. Ambrosius asked me to send you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>July 21, 1533.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name Leo, Karlstadt, and any good people, especially Theodor.</p>
      <p>From the heart, yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Heinrich Bullinger, to be respected in many ways.</p>
