      <p>Greetings. I have received your letter written on the 6th of this month.</p>
      <p>From your envoy, you have understood the proceedings of the Diet of Augsburg and have seen the proposal of the king's envoys; I am sending the response. I know you are not disturbed by what they commonly say about peace, since the Lord reigns and governs all things. I hope to see you soon and we will converse.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Martyr, Mr. Walter, and those who inquire about me. Solothurn, 18th of May.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, as you know.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
