      <p>Greetings. Upon my return from Frankfurt, I received your letter (most esteemed man), which bears witness to your spirit and utmost love for me; for you show that you write to me amidst the waves of your affairs, which partly makes me rejoice and partly makes me sorrowful. For your letter, though brief, contains a splendid and consoling example of Jesus and Jehoiada; however, I am sorry that I have been an impediment to you, so well and intensely occupied; for I know that you are burdened with the care of many and very serious matters and that you are almost continuously distracted by the greatest of affairs. Therefore, I ask you not to divert yourself henceforth, even for a moment, from your duties on my account, unless you have time for rest and leisure; for although I can write to your kindness more often, being now unburdened by any public duty, that is, office, your situation is not the same and not as simple. Therefore, even though I most gladly hear from you and with the greatest desire, I will bear it with an even mind if you do not respond except at the times and in the ways mentioned above; concerning which this messenger will also report to you from my conversation. I have also learned from our Chamberlain's report about your pious zeal and efforts undertaken for Bancho. He has not yet fully recovered, but he is doing better; he will always confess that he owes you a great deal, and I give you the greatest thanks on his behalf. However, we entrust the rendering of thanks to God, who alone can do so abundantly; whom I pray to preserve and govern you for the benefit and advantage of His church. In this, fare well. Strasbourg, April 24, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted to piety, James Haddon. I have greeted our Sampson in your name and others.</p>
      <p>To the man of excellent doctrine and piety and the father in Christ to be revered, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
