      <p>S. P. L. Reinhart von Ratlo left these enclosed letters with me here in Basel two months ago, so that I might send them to you, reverend sir, when the opportunity arose. Wishing to fulfill my friend's request, I gave them not long after to a certain Frenchman, who said he was going to Zürich and would meet you. However, having changed his plans, he went to Geneva and, after a long interval, returned them to me with my own letters, which were enclosed. For this reason, I am truly sorry that they are reaching you later, and I ask that you excuse me in this matter.</p>
      <p>Reinhart himself had added these epithalamic poems to his letters, and I have added the title of Nazianzenus, which I have been diligently working on for two years now, both in terms of interpretation and in comparing ancient texts. This winter, it will be impressively adorned and printed with typographic engravings. I hope that good men will approve of this work; indeed, I have expended great effort, which I will not regret if I encounter fair judgments from people. Otherwise, I would regret having interrupted my study of civil law for so long, which I have long embraced and continue to pursue.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, and forgive my audacity, for I have not hesitated to write to you, though I am unknown to you until now.</p>
      <p>Three days before the Kalends of September, Basel. Written by your devoted Johannes Löwenklau.</p>
      <p>To the reverend and most beloved man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zürich, his esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Johannes Löwenklau, translator of Gregory Nazianzen, 1570.</p>
