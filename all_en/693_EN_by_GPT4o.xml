      <p>Greetings. It is not due to our fault that we respond to you, Calvin, most learned man and dearest brother in the Lord, after such a long interval of time. For the other brothers, to whom we sent your letter, have been slower in presenting their opinion to us. This is how the matter stands. We are pleased with the changed preface. We are pleased to insert or add what you thought should be inserted or added to our writing. For from these, a certain light seems to be added to the writing.</p>
      <p>We have submitted our conclusion and now await your opinion on whether it is approved by you, or what you wish to be added, removed, or changed in it. We have therefore drafted a form which we allow to be presented and communicated to our brothers, if it also pleases you and our dearest brother D. Farel, so that it may be a testimony of our mutual agreement in the Lord. We send this form written in better characters than I can write.</p>
      <p>Now, regarding the opinions of the brothers, this is how it stands. We have communicated nothing of this to the ministers of the church of Basel, for no other reason than that within the span of a year they have published, or rather renewed, their confession of faith, to which ours agrees well, and it seemed superfluous to request a confession or opinion from them, which they had not long ago published. The ministers of the churches of Schaffhausen and St. Gallen have approved everything with gratitude.</p>
      <p>The ministers of the church of Bern responded in these words: we unanimously approve this explanation of D. Johannes Calvin with our vote and support, and we acknowledge, recognize, and praise it as pious, certain, and sound, praying to the Lord that He may grant His spirit to all of us and confirm it in us, so that no occasion for evasion may be seized from these. However, it does not seem appropriate to publish it at this time, nor do we, as we have written before, consent to a public edition, namely that it be published at our command. For the whole matter must first be referred to the magistrate: which at present does not seem to be fruitful. The brothers of Bern wrote these and other things of this kind and in this opinion. There is also another man, certainly learned and pious and well-deserving of letters and the church of God, who among other things wrote to me: Regarding the publication of this writing, it does not seem to me that there will be as much benefit in common as there will be quarrels and disturbances, not because it is not such that it cannot be very beneficial in itself, but because of the incredible malice of the present times and the disturbance of all things. This he said. However, it does not seem to us that our agreement should be completely suppressed, but that publication through printing should be deferred for the present and for a better occasion. But if it seems to you and Farel that our described agreement should be sent to France or to other pious brothers, it is indeed allowed by us, as I indicated at the beginning of this letter. We will also communicate the described form to some pious brothers throughout Germany, if we first understand that this form does not displease you. In the meantime, I cannot conceal that I have sent this form to my intimate friends in England, D. Utenhove, Treherne, and Hopper, but with the condition that they retain it for themselves and the faithful until they understand that the final hand has been placed on it. We hope, however, that you will not disapprove of anything in our conclusion.</p>
      <p>All the ministers of this church, pastors, and readers, in whose name and by whose command I have written this, greet you, D. Farel, D. Viret, D. Gallas, and all other fellow ministers. Farewell, most learned and dearest brother to us. Let us love one another and pray to our common savior, king, and priest, that with the Antichrist defeated, Christ alone may reign.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 30th September 1549.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man D. Johannes Calvin, the most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, venerable lord, and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
