      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your letter, venerable man, on the 23rd of April, in which I was informed that it would be advisable, considering the circumstances, to delay the matter of promoting the minister of the church in Betschwanden for a while, until the assembly in Baden, now convened for our sake, is concluded.</p>
      <p>You undoubtedly hope that once these are completed, our affairs will be somewhat more favorable and everything will be settled; I feel differently, I fear that the conditions of peace we will receive will be much worse than before, which may the Lord greatly avert.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I think it worthwhile that the work of Christ should not be prolonged any further, and that a preacher should be appointed to the church as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>For two years now, it has not had its own pastor.</p>
      <p>Our enemies are far more vigilant in their affairs than we are, who, without regard to assemblies or councils, continue to faithfully promote the papacy.</p>
      <p>Piety will advise us to do the same in the cause of Christ our Lord.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I wanted to ask you again, if it can be done, to send us a man who is distinguished by his doctrine and holy way of life, whose family is also honorable, so that a profane life does not destroy what is fittingly good.</p>
      <p>He will receive 80 gold coins from the church treasury.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord well, who may also deign to prolong your life in the Christian republic. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given on the 12th of June, 1563, in Glarus. Fridolin Brunner, minister of the word among the people of Glarus, most observant of you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and venerable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the word of the church in Zurich, my lord and esteemed brother.</p>
