      <p>I did not receive your last letter, my father, until the eighth day of this month, so I could not respond sooner. However, you have a full, indeed perhaps even longer than necessary, response to those slanders of wicked men. For I wanted you to understand everything from the very beginning, so that with the case itself well understood, you may not only not be disturbed by their most wicked attempts, but also, if necessary, support the struggling French churches with your authority, although I hope that they will be easily restrained, whether they show themselves to be teachable or whether their obstinacy causes them to be expelled from the assemblies of the pious. I earnestly and wholeheartedly beseech you to be careful that what they uniquely aim for, namely to alienate you from us and involve you in these dissensions, is diligently avoided, which we will also do carefully. Nor do I wish you to be persuaded that the will of the French churches is any different. I am sending you the synodical canons so that nothing at all of what is happening in those churches is hidden from you. However, I wish it to be carefully ensured that if they are translated into Latin, they do not fall into anyone's hands, from which it might happen that they are published, since it has been decreed for just reasons that they should not yet be printed, as many things in them are adapted to the necessity of the present times. Regarding the Saxon dissension, I feel exactly as you do and hope, even if Satan rages a thousand times and mixes heaven with earth.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it is necessary to commend the pious to the Lord with constant prayers, that He may grant them strength of mind and invincible courage. I am returning to you the letters you shared with me and thank you for them. I have not shared them with any mortal, which I also think should be carefully observed by us/you in similar matters, so much so that I now write nothing to friends there, fearing that if the letters are intercepted, those rabid men may find what they seek. But since, meanwhile, whatever Landgrave writes and swears, they dare anything with impunity, please write what you think we should do. For I have an excellent writing by someone, by which they are so refuted that I do not think they will have anything to respond.</p>
      <p>However, I have decided to do nothing here without your advice. In France, the hope of the pious is growing, and our best hero continues in the best favor with the king, whose mind I wish may always remain the same. There are those who fear that the Spaniards, now becoming fierce and fearing that holy alliance, may change his mind. But I think he will be all the more eager to preserve peace among his people. But everything is in the Lord's hand. As for our alliance, I know that this matter is very dear to the king's heart (which I ask to be said between us). But if even those of the Five Cantons persistently refuse it, I am certain that if your people took the initiative, there would hardly be any delay among the others, which I would certainly prefer to us being united with them as well. Therefore, I strongly commend this to you, which I also wish you to be persuaded is not written by me rashly.</p>
      <p>The price of wheat among us is rising greatly every day; especially the neighbors, with whom our people recently dealt in vain, using this one pretext of their own envoys, since they had nothing to oppose to our people's arguments, that they had no power from their prince to decide any controversies. Therefore, we hang, as usual, subject to infinite injuries and bravely waiting for God to redeem us. By God's grace, there are hardly any remnants of the plague among us now, and next week we hope to restore both schools. Our Lavater has revived, though not without great expense and great care and concern from the doctor and the widow with whom I placed him half-dead, about which our Roset promised to write fully there, so that Father Lavater may not regret the money spent, by which I dare to testify that his son's life was almost called back from the very grave by God's grace. I was about to write to him myself, if there had not been so many things to be written at one and the same time, that I had to use the work of an amanuensis against my custom in writing longer letters. I am sending back to him the letter of Mr. VultE II, which I greatly enjoyed reading. This same reason, I am sure, will now indeed excuse me with my dearest brother, Mr. Galter, about whose relative I will write as accurately as possible to Mr. Admiral today; for I would prefer him to be with him than with Navarre or anyone else. Whatever response I receive, I will immediately ensure that he understands.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father, and continue to love us. May the Lord Jesus keep you from all evil.</p>
      <p>Geneva, November 13, in the year of our Lord 1571. Yours, Beza, who was and will be until the very last breath, with God's favor.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the truly faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, my most revered father.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
