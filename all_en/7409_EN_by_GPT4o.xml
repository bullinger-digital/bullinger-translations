      <p>Greetings. Yesterday I was writing not sufficiently equipped with strong powers.</p>
      <p>Today I am stuck in the same mire; but these are the works of the Lord, who loves us, etc. At this hour, as the public courier here asks whether I wish to write anything to Chur, letters are brought in this sense: On the 2nd of February, three cohorts of Italians were intercepted by the prince in Burgundy and slaughtered to annihilation. Again, not far from Nevers on the Loire, Gonzaga, the brother of the Duke of Mantua, having obtained the favor of our queen two years ago and the daughter and the very ample goods of the Duke of Nevers, was also intercepted by the Condés and was gravely wounded. However, he escaped wounded; but they say he barely escaped death and a great slaughter of those most wicked ones was made. From Lyon, three surgeons were sent to him and to other wounded by arranged horses, to whom that Edmund the Jesuit joined himself, so that they might have doctors of both mind and body at the same time. It is also established that the town of Blois was taken by the prince, it is from some part of the Orléans garrison. Rumor also brings the same about Tours and now Bourges is besieged, the prince meanwhile proceeding to Paris. But these are not as certain as the former. Adrezzanus, a Sodomite now apostate, entered the town of Costa on the Rhône, fortified by the mere bravery of four hundred soldiers, after the third assault, but deserted by the Condés, who all with the inhabitants safely withdrew to another nearby place. This so badly affected his soldiers, as if they had escaped with his knowledge, that their forces dissolved in an uprising. You have no doubt heard about the immense fleet of the Turks, which is thought to invade Italy. In Spain, something incredible happened, but nevertheless very certain: Charles thought about killing his father Philip; but now the son is guarded by the father. The cause is still unknown; a great misfortune. These things are thus written from France on February 24th. I wanted to share these.</p>
      <p>Believe as much as you like; I recite them as I received them, word for word.</p>
      <p>Greet the three lords, the consuls, Lord Karl, Ganthner, Pontasella, and all friends. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Zürich at evening on the 6th of March in the year 1568. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Tobias Egli, the most faithful minister of the church of Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
