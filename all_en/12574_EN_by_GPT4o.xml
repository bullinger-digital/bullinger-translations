    <p xml:id="regest1">Serin received Bullinger's letter from June 18 [not preserved] through Wilhelm [Reublin] and was astonished that Bullinger deemed his hastily written letter [from May 13; HBBW XXI, No. 2447] worthy of a response. This proves Bullinger's brotherly love and humility! As Bullinger rightly suspected, Serin does not value Bullinger's [book] gift [“Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae confessio”] by its market value, but by its content. Moreover, Serin is both pleased and surprised at how easily Bullinger has accepted him into his circle of friends. All the more he is ashamed of his superficial response [from May 13] to Bullinger's first letter [from September 18, 1545; HBBW XV, No. 2246].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- However, he cannot change anything about it. Nor can he, with the present letter (just as he could not with his previous letter), answer Bullinger's first letter in detail, as he had to leave it behind with all his household goods [in Znaim] when he was persecuted. Therefore, he is also unable to mention by name all those who sent their greetings to him at that time.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- However, in response to Bullinger's [last] inquiry, the following is to be reported: He is trying in Ulm (even if he is not up to the task) to use the gift entrusted to him by God in the service of His word and His sacraments. May the Lord grant him success! May He also protect all His own from reckless and new teachings!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- This as a response to Bullinger's last letter [from July 18], as he is obviously interested in a correspondence with him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The two citizens of Zurich, [Meinrat Oggenfuß and Hans Hug], who accompanied Wilhelm [Reublin] [in June 1546] to Moravia, stayed for a few days [with Reublin] in Ulm due to unforeseen war dangers before they continued their journey to Moravia by ship. On July 14, Serin wrote to [Reublin]. He entrusted the letter to a resident of Znaim [...] who had to abandon his journey northward [due to the war unrest]. In his letter, he asked [Reublin] to inquire with the letter carrier about the safest return route for the Zurichers. On the 5th [of August], he wrote again to inquire about them, and he hopes to receive a response before the end of the month.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger should strongly recommend Serin to [Johannes] Haller, who lives in Augsburg. Greetings to the colleagues, especially to Konrad Pellikan, whose hard work on the interpretation of the Bible Serin particularly appreciates.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The aforementioned book gift was left to the brothers in Bohemian Moravia because they earnestly requested it. They are spreading this writing, as it is well-suited for refuting [heresies]. Serin hopes that the brothers will arrange for a translation into Czech. Beneš Optát, pastor in Wiese near Iglau, in the domain of Baron von Trebitsch [Jan z Pernštejna], would be particularly suitable for such a task.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Greetings to the colleagues. May the Lord strengthen them in all their endeavors! Greetings also to Christoph Froschauer, to whom Serin is particularly obliged for printing the Bible. By the way, Froschauer is Serin's compatriot. He comes from Kastl near Altötting. In the latter-mentioned place, Serin once worked as a teacher when his mother lived in Landshut.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- The [Zurichers] will probably also call their congregations to prayer in these dangerous times.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- [PS.:] For the sake of Bullinger's friends, Serin now wants to report some things about the current events.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- Enclosed is the fictional dream [“Warhaffte unnd gegründte meldung”] of the Reutlingen pastor Johannes Schradin. The title of this publication was written by [Johannes] Piscatorius; the marginal notes by Nikolaus Franz Statius, an official of the city of Münster and envoy of the Cologne [Archbishop Hermann von Wied] at the last Imperial Diet in Regensburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- In the [Ulm] office of [Hans] Varnier, there will be a reprint of the defense of the Saxon Elector [Johann Friedrich] and the Landgrave Philipp [of Hesse]. Since Bullinger may have already received this publication from Haller, Serin wants to wait [before sending Bullinger a copy].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- [Martin] Frecht was sent by the Ulm council to proclaim the Gospel and to establish new congregations in Dillingen and other places in the Diocese of Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- Piscatorius has become a field preacher. In addition to his good salary (which he was already receiving through the parish position assigned to him in the city), he receives 24 Rhenish gold [thalers] per month. His son [...], whom he took with him as a servant, receives four. Both were mustered as foot soldiers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Today or tomorrow, the Saxon Elector and the [Landgrave] will personally join the Swabian army, which is assembled at Donauwörth. They are leading 24,000 infantrymen and 6,000 cavalrymen with them and are accompanied by 24 counts and barons. Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg will receive them all. The Elector Palatine [Friedrich II.] is also expected to arrive soon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- It is said that the mercenaries of the four companies of German soldiers that Emperor [Charles V] has around him in Regensburg did not want to take an oath when they learned that the campaign was to go against their homeland Germany.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- May the Lord of Hosts end these conflicts!</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I received the letter dated June 18, most learned Bullinger, through Wilhelm, not without great admiration, that you deemed it worthy to respond so gravely to such a hasty and disdainful little letter. But it was necessary, so that I might have a more certain proof of your charity and humility. As for your mention of my gratitude, which I do not recognize, it seemed to me that you wanted to preemptively prevent me from ever giving thanks (which I owe). If I have satisfied you in this matter, I have certainly not satisfied myself. I do not flatter, Bullinger! For, as you rightly judged, I did not estimate the monetary value of your gift, but the spirit of the giver and the thing itself, which that small gift carries with it, and furthermore, the admirable ease in you, such a great man (let there be no foul flattery in the word), with which you began to deal with me so familiarly, having received me into your flock, that I regretted having touched so lightly upon things that could not be omitted without great disgrace in that letter, which I wrote to you shortly after receiving your first one.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>But since it has come to this, I will now let it go. For your first letter was not at hand (which I greatly regret), nor is it now, so that I could respond to each point in order. For I had to leave it behind with the rest of my belongings to others, and I do not know if I will ever retrieve it. Furthermore, among other things, I regret that your letter was intercepted from me, because I do not remember the names of each individual who greeted me, so that they could be greeted by name in return. Then I wonder, Bullinger, what you mean by saying that you consider it a favor that I responded to your letters, as if I should not rather consider it a favor that you so kindly receive my audacity, with which I address you, and even interrupt your holy and outstanding affairs, and take it in good part. You should not have anticipated me in this way, unless you wanted to remind me of my duty and thus civilly provoke me to render what is due. But I know you seek nothing of this kind. Therefore, I prefer to have gratitude for you rather than to express it, especially for your voluntarily offered service and declared eagerness to accommodate me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Regarding my affairs, as they stand, I have nothing particular to report to you, as you wish, except that here I am not sufficiently suitable and worthy in the ministry of the word and those things attached to it, that is, the sacraments, etc., inaugurated, I strive to gain something for the Lord with the talent entrusted to me, according to my smallness. May the Lord bless the labors and preserve all His own from frivolous and new opinions, as you piously and rightly seem to admonish and pray for me, for which I thank you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I have deemed these things to be written in response to your last letter, since you wish that, with mutually joined spirits, we do not cease to greet each other with friendly letters, although I sincerely judge and acknowledge myself to be both unequal and unworthy of this exchange. Therefore, I have only wished to give this, so that you would not think that this most humane provocation of yours was little pleasing and delightful to me. But now to other matters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Your two citizens, whom Wilhelm brought with him, stayed here for a few days due to those unforeseen tumults and imminent dangers, deliberating about the journey undertaken to Moravia. Finally, they boarded a ship and continued. May the Lord bring them back safely! On July 14, I wrote to Znaim to Wilhelm through a certain resident of that city (who was not allowed to descend further by ship), advising them not to return unless they first learned from that courier how safe the passage was everywhere and by which route they could return most securely. On the fifth of this month, I wrote again to Znaim to my people, among other things, ordering them to write back to me about these good men, and I do not doubt that I will have a response around the end of this month.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>If you ever write to your Haller, now residing in Augsburg, I earnestly ask you to commend me to him diligently, and that I may understand that I am henceforth commended to him by your authority; in whatever way he wishes, order him to take care of it. Then also commend me diligently to all the brothers who are with you and wish to say the best of health from me to each one most dutifully, I ask greatly. Especially to Mr. Konrad Pellikan, a most respectable man, you will announce that I am also among their number, indeed a great one, who give him immense thanks for the undertaken illustrious and arduous labors in compiling commentaries on the sacred Bible.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The booklet (mentioned at the beginning of this letter) I left in Bohemian Moravia to some brothers who earnestly requested it, who immediately began to commend it most diligently to as many as possible with great rejoicing and to publish it as widely as possible. And, as I hope, those excellent brothers, especially Benedict Optatus among the rest, holding the first place for the grace of gifts, the pastor of Pratensis (zur Wyß) near the city of Tryglau under the dominion of Baron von Trebitsch, will ensure that it is also translated into the Bohemian language, which favors antilogies too much; for they are well-versed in both Bohemian and German alike.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell in the Lord Jesus with all the brothers, especially the fellow ministers, whom I sincerely bid farewell. May the Lord strengthen you and make you as strong as possible in your holy and illustrious labors! Relying on His help, proceed unshaken! I earnestly pray to Him that He may never allow your pious efforts to be in vain, but may grant them both place and effect everywhere. Furthermore, you will inform your printer Christoph Froschauer that he is by no means frustrated with me for his deserved and worthy praise and gratitude for the care taken in printing the sacred Bibles, etc. Then, since I also recognize and love Bavaria as my homeland, you will also greet him as a compatriot for me, to whom the castle of Neapolis, from where he originates, is well known, since it is near Altötting, where I once served as a teacher, having a mother from Landshut.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Farewell again, all of you, remembering me in your prayers. In those most serious and dangerous tumults, I do not doubt that you will exhort the churches to fruits worthy of repentance, to prayer, and to the invocation of divine aid as if this were now the primary argument.</p>

      <p>Even though it is more fitting and pleasing for us to write about ecclesiastical and theological matters than about military and such other matters, I thought I would gratify you because of the friends, whom you undoubtedly have many, if I added something about these as well.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Here you have the fictional dream of Johannes Schradin, minister of the Reutlingen church. The title was made by our Piscatorius. The marginal notes are by Doctor Nikolaus Franz Statius, syndic of Münster, etc., envoy of the Elector of Cologne, etc., at these Regensburg assemblies.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>These days, from our Varnierian office, the Apology of the Saxon Elector and the Prince of Hesse, Philipp, will be published, in which they testify and demonstrate that the charge of treason is falsely brought against them, etc. But since these have already been published a second time, I wanted to wait, thinking you might have already seen them, perhaps procured by Haller himself.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Our Frecht was sent by our magistrate to Dillingen and other places in the Diocese of Augsburg to preach the Gospel and establish churches.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Johannes Piscatorius has become a field preacher and, in addition to his ample salary (which he indeed has from the position he holds in the city and which we must satisfy for free until he happily returns, which God grant), 24 Rhenish gold coins will be added each month. His son, whom he took with him as a servant, will be given 4, and both are foot soldiers.</p>
      <p>Today or certainly tomorrow, the Saxon Elector and the Landgrave will come in person, as it is said, to our Swabian army gathered in Donauwörth (which is said to have 55 banners), with 24,000 infantry and 6,000 cavalry following them, among whom they certainly write there are 24 counts and princes (gefürst grafen) besides many other counts and barons, many of whom are old and very serious. Duke of Württemberg will receive them all there. Some say that the Elector Palatine will also soon be present.</p>
      <p>They say the emperor has 4 banners of German soldiers with him in Regensburg, whom he cannot bind by oath, since they understood that the war was instituted against their homeland Germany. The same is said of many others.</p>
      <p>May the Lord of Hosts end the battles, so that not so many bodies are harmed and souls perish. Amen, amen.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy bishop of the Zurich church and most well-deserving of all theology candidates, his teacher and brother in Christ, beloved and much to be respected. Zurich.</p>
