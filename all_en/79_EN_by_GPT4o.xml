    <p xml:id="regest1">Frey had already written to Bullinger twice regarding the question that had been troubling him for some time [about the prohibition of marrying one's own niece] [hbbw XX, No. 3075 and No. 3087, dated November 13 and December 1, 1547], and then sent him his own solution proposal for this trivial problem [18013 on January 20, 1548]. He is now eagerly awaiting Bullinger's assessment. Bullinger should inform him if the letter has not arrived. In that case, Frey would write to him again (even if he becomes a nuisance to Bullinger).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Since the capture of [Duke Johann Friedrich I of Saxony] and [Landgrave Philipp of Hesse] by Emperor Charles V, the people of Biel have received no news about the two. Bullinger should inform them about this, as well as about Charles V, if he knows anything reliable. Otherwise, the people of Biel might not receive any news.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Greetings, also from the people of Biel, to Bullinger and the people of Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[P.S.:] Frey wanted to add the following: It is certain that under King Henry II of France, there is cruel persecution against the Protestants. In Paris, confessors of the true faith are continuously being burned. They even cut out the tongues of those who, due to their eloquence, could convert others to their faith during public executions!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Another greeting.</p>

      <p>S.D.P. If you are well, it is good. I am well. I had written to you again, my father, about that trivial question which has troubled me for a long time. Finally, I seem to have discovered where I was mistaken. Whether I have discovered it correctly or not, I eagerly await your judgment. If you have not received those letters, please let me know through the next messenger. And I will write to you again and make sure that you call me a rather troublesome and annoyingly persistent man in demanding what I desire.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I also pray that you write briefly to inform me about the Saxon, imperial, and Hessian matters, if you have any reliable information. Since the princes were taken captive, we have heard nothing about these matters. Nor perhaps will we hear anything further if you remain silent.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Our people greet you. Greet all yours in my words. Farewell. Biel/Bienne, 5 days before the Kalends of April 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely from the heart, Johann Leopold Frey.</p>

      <p>[I] was about to write this: It is most certain that under this king, the French are savagely persecuting the faithful in Christ. In Paris, those who acknowledge and confess the pure truth are continuously burned. If any are captured who are gifted with eloquence, so that no one might be converted by their final confessions, their tongues are first cut out. Then they are led out in public and tortured, etc.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished in doctrine and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most revered father. Zurich.</p>
