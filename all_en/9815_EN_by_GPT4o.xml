      <p>Greetings. Just as it was announced from Palermo, the capital of the Kingdom of Sicily, that the fortress of Tunis was captured by the Turks, so many of our people, who have returned from Milan and Venice in recent days, affirm with certainty that this is indeed the case, and that it was captured and conquered on September 23rd before noon. The Turks have entrenched themselves with timber and earthworks in such a way that no artillery could harm them. In Italy, there is a common saying and fear that the Turks are heard saying that before 6 or 7 months have passed, they must have their horses eat oats on the altars in Rome. Our provost, when I encountered him today, initially denied the conquest; but when he read some of Mr. Lentulus's letters, he did not oppose much, yet he said that the Turks still had many obstacles to overcome before penetrating into Sicily. Blind men promise themselves I don't know what holidays, which, however, the Turkish fury turns into working and laborious days every year. May God, the best and greatest, have mercy on us. Amen.</p>
      <p>Most swiftly from Chur, Rhaetia, October 17, 1574. Your devoted Tobias Egli. Yesterday, I also sent two copies filled with news from Italy through another. I wish to be informed whether you have received everything. (a. t.) Goletta has been conquered and captured.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the Church of Zürich, his singularly esteemed lord. Zürich.</p>
