      <p>Greetings and peace through Christ Jesus. It will be two years this coming February since you sent us a letter to Mulhouse (MÃ¼lhausen) along with the most pious and learned exposition of your agreement with D. Calvin on the matter of the sacraments, most learned Lord Bullinger. However, we have not yet replied to either you or D. Calvin, for which we are rightly accused by you of both ingratitude and incivility. I beg you, therefore, through Christ Jesus, to forgive us this incivility. We did not fail to respond out of ingratitude, contempt, or because we disagree with you on the matter of the sacraments. For both I and all my brothers and colleagues feel exactly the same as you do, and we rejoice from the heart at such pious, learned, and Christian truth-consistent writings that followed the agreement, both from you and from D. Calvin. We embrace and hold as the greatest treasure both your apology and both of D. Calvin's defenses, for which writings we give you immortal thanks not only in our name but also in the name of the whole church of Christ.</p>
      <p>The reason we have not yet replied is that my colleagues complained that they were already very tired of such altercations, and although they felt simply and piously with you, they said they were very much averse to quarreling with anyone about this matter. For we were all unaware of the impious and filled with the worst calumnies books published by Wiestphalus: however, although I am unknown to you all, I promised to write back to you and especially to you, if only to establish some connection with you, not because I wish to think or have others think so highly of me, but rather because I recognize in you a singular piety, learning, truth, and humanity from your books. But among other things, the greatest obstacle for me was the scarcity of couriers, for very rarely do those who seek Zurich (Tigurum) come to us.</p>
      <p>We all wish and very earnestly pray to God the Best and Greatest, that all of us who acknowledge and confess our Lord Jesus Christ, that the eucharistic dissension which that rascal Wiestphalus has revived from the underworld, may finally be settled in whatever pious and just way it can be done, with the truth preserved and unharmed.</p>
      <p>Our most excellent and pious old man and my dearest brother Matthias Erbius wrote to me these days, and indicated the pious zeal of his prince in this matter, who also sent letters to you and instructed D. Erbius himself to encourage you, if perhaps some way of concord could be found. It would not seem unwise to me if first a synod of all the Swiss churches were held before anything was attempted in the matter of concord. In which the principal brothers, ministers of the churches, would confer among themselves beforehand, so that one would not dissent from another, from which our enemies would again seize the opportunity to slander. It would be your task to convene the brothers from everywhere in some convenient place, having first consulted the magistrate of each one, not only for the matter of the supper but also for other things very necessary and useful for the church of our Lord Christ.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is also another rather arduous matter that greatly burdens my conscience, in which I seek and request your advice. You cannot be unaware of that alliance, which some years ago was entered into with the French, not only by the papist places of the Swiss but also by those who have embraced the pure doctrine of the gospel of Jesus Christ, I mean Basel (Basileam), Schaffhausen (Schafusiam), and most of those who are joined with them in the alliance, such as the Rhaetians (Rheti), St. Gallen (Sangallense), and our Mulhouse (Milhusani). However, that alliance was maintained among us, even while the consuls and senators who first received the doctrine of the gospel and established Christian honesty were still living, so that very few of ours went to serve as soldiers, and they did so somewhat secretly and furtively.</p>
      <p>But after those excellent consular men, who were endowed with divine zeal, completed the course of nature, the situation among us is also being led into another state. For we have a Consul who, within one or two months at Solothurn (Soloturni), begged from the one who acts as the representative of the King of France, to accept and create his stepson as the head and leader of the soldiers. He, having raised the banner, left Mulhouse (Milhusa) and took with him a proper number of the best citizens, which had not been seen in Mulhouse (Milhusae) for more than thirty years. But how much luxury, how much impiety, and finally how much contempt of our Lord God, of His word, and of all piety and honesty this military service will bring with it, you yourself can most easily judge.</p>
      <p>Concerning all these things, I have admonished them with the greatest faithfulness I could and diligently dissuaded them from such an impious course, but with my faithful admonition, I achieved nothing more than to stir up almost universal hatred against me. But I know for certain that when those who have given themselves to such a nefarious crime return, they will immediately want to participate in the ecclesiastical communion, as if they had not intended anything at all: however, I do not see that it is our place, who are the overseers and ministers of the church, to admit them, but the magistrate will not at all tolerate that any of them be barred from communion. Therefore, considering these and many other similar things, my mind is to leave Mulhouse (Milhusa) and move elsewhere, but I seek your faithful advice on this intention of mine. For I do not wish to attempt anything without the advice of pious and learned brothers.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and I ask you to greet Johann Hugo the younger, along with all those who (if I am not mistaken) set out for Marburg (Marpurgum) with him three years ago, in my name. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>In Mulhouse (Milhusae), on the third day before the Nones of January, in the year of our Lord 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Conrad Finck, Ecclesiastes of Mulhouse (Milhusanus).</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the supreme overseer of the church of Zurich (Tigurinae), the most faithful defender of Christian truth, my most esteemed lord, etc.</p>
