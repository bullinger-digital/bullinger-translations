      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. On the 6th of July, as you learned from our deacon, my colleague Mr. Zender passed away to the Lord. You can understand the state of both our republic and church from the fact that they have chosen Ismaël Duxer, a young man almost childish in both age and manners, as their pastor. It is clear from this what spirit guides them, as they wanted a man with unrefined manners and no education to be a preacher, especially in these times. But it was by divine kindness that the most honorable Bernese Senate noticed what they were attempting, and thus annulled this election and calling. Now, there will be consultation about calling another. I have not forgotten Mr. Gervasius; he was also nominated before, but in vain, because they do not want a foreigner, as is usual with such people, who easily find a reason to despise both the word and its ministers, being weary and pained to have strong and fearless ministers of the word. Everything threatens ruin, because a large part of those who have been placed at the helm are Epicurean swine, some look back to the pots of Egypt, and a smaller part love the word of God somewhat, yet they are so cold and timid that you cannot tell whether to call them white or black. There are indeed many things that move me to wish you to be more mindful of me than ever before, if there should be a suitable condition, especially when I consider what they have often attempted to do to the honorable, pious, strong, and well-deserving old man Mr. Zender, who was nevertheless a citizen, unless I had resisted with all my strength, I cannot help but grieve. What, I ask, should I, a foreigner, expect? There are, after all, children, a wife, a more than meager stipend, and countless other inconveniences. But I will follow the Lord's will and desire; I do not doubt that He will soon provide well for me, if not in my homeland, then at least elsewhere among Christians. If only you could see the state of our republic, you would not be able to marvel enough, I know. I will take care, as the Lord has willed me to be in Aarau, that they do not perish unadmonished; I will commit the outcome to the Lord. They want to have a citizen; I am not unaware of what they seek, someone who either winks at or confirms the wicked in their wickedness, for he is compelled to do so, since he can turn elsewhere, unless he wishes to be torn apart by the hatred and slanders of all. I hope, however, that the Lord will be present for His church, now in danger, so that the plans of the impious may be broken. There are some good and pious men whose prayers the Lord will not disdain. We will therefore wait to see what kind of colleague they will give me; when that has been done, you will soon learn from me; from which the matter itself will teach me what I must do. You, as I hope, will do in my cause what you would wish to be done for your own children. I pray to the most good and great God for your daughter Anna, that her marriage may be happy.</p>
      <p>My wife and I pray for the health of your entire household. Farewell and love me, as you are accustomed, and hold me in your commendation.</p>
      <p>Aarau, July 21, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord.</p>
