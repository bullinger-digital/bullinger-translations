      <p>As soon as I arrived in Rapperswil, I wanted to know how Aegidius Schudicus was doing; for I was greatly desirous of seeing him. It was announced that he had gone to the abbot of St. Gallen, and from there he was to proceed to the marshal and the Limousin. Jodocus Schudicus, who led the legion, came to meet me in Vals, and with him three of his Glarean men. I had much conversation with Jodocus, whom I urged as earnestly as I could towards peace and concord. He left me in such a way that he seemed to be giving some heed to my advice, or at least promised to do so.</p>
      <p>It is timely that you all look out for the common safety together. I immediately wrote to the marshal and the Limousin about what seemed to me to be taken care of in this matter.</p>
      <p>I will not fail the good cause. - I found everything quite calm in Chur.</p>
      <p>The Philippians seemed to be cooling off and were seeking my favor of their own accord, because I am alone; let another come: he will not be sent back empty-handed.</p>
      <p>But behold, letters have arrived from the prefect of the Valtellina, announcing that the prefect of the Milanese has come to Grawedona, which is located on the borders of the Valtellina, with four hundred horsemen, and that two thousand foot soldiers are following him; he has learned this from the letters of the praetor of Morbegno, who lives not far from Grawedona; he has also discovered this from the letters of others and has therefore decided to ride there immediately to look out for the public safety; for the whole region is in great fear; for it is unusual for such a large number of armed men to be seen in such nearby places. He also writes that he will send a messenger tonight to inform the senate of the Three Leagues more certainly about the whole matter. I cannot quite conjecture, if these things are true, what the Spaniard is planning; for no injury has been inflicted by the Rhaetians, and he has so far pretended to want to make some treaty with these people. But if this is treachery, see that it does not harbor some greater monster.</p>
      <p>Various people are imagining various things in this matter, namely that it was done to instill terror in the Rhaetians and by that means to compel them to enter into a treaty even against their will.</p>
      <p>But this seems a very foolish invention. The King of France is no longer bound by any treaty to protect the Rhaetians, but nevertheless, in the peace that exists between him and the King of Spain, he wanted the Swiss and Rhaetians to be expressly included. For these reasons, the senate was convened here in Chur at night.</p>
      <p>But tomorrow morning something more certain will be known, and I will add to this letter.</p>
      <p>The eleventh hour is approaching, and I have already written much today, so I must now rest. Master Gwalter will greet you in my name.</p>
      <p>If the plague in Zurich worsens, I would like you, in your wisdom, to look out for the Cognetii and the Scevi. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, September 18.</p>
      <p>Yours, P[omponne] Belli√®vre.</p>
      <p>This letter was written today, September 19, and letters from Bregaglia were delivered to the consuls and senate of Chur. They announce that they have heard that five hundred Spaniards have occupied Travona, which is a town located in the Valtellina.</p>
      <p>The spirits of the people are completely alarmed and a levy is proclaimed throughout Rhaetia. But when I had decided to wait for something more certain, that panic rumor finally cooled down.</p>
      <p>Some have arrived from the Valtellina and Milan. They say that the prefect of Milan is riding through the regions bordering Rhaetia for the purpose of inspecting the garrisons and fortifications of the towns; he is indeed with some cavalry, but nothing is heard about infantry; moreover, he has not moved against the Rhaetians.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt that this rumor was spread by some treacherous people with a foolish, as I said, invention, so that the power of the Milanese might be a terror to the Rhaetians; but I hope the ill-intentioned trick will turn out badly for its author.</p>
      <p>It is announced that Count John Angusola, the envoy of Philip, has decided to return to the Rhaetians to negotiate and conclude a treaty. If these things are true, a greater order of things arises for me.</p>
      <p>If I hear anything further, I will inform you. Farewell, most excellent man.</p>
      <p>Chur, September 20.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Master Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
