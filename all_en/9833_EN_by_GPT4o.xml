      <p>Although, esteemed brother, the nature of things and people, and the course of times today, are such that if Germany is not to perish, it seems it must perish, and it is especially worthwhile to raise the fallen and sleeping faith, almost corrupted by long peace, by divine judgment: Yet both the nature of our duty and our piety towards our homeland demand that, just as doctors observe every moment to support the sick and ward off disease in the gravest and most desperate illnesses, so we should omit nothing that, if not avert, at least alleviate the worsening evils. In this spirit, we wanted to write something to you, a most wise man and a most esteemed minister of the church, in the name of the most illustrious prince, the elector, so that we may use common consolations in common miseries, and oppose the united minds and counsels taken with God as the sharpest weapon against Satan's efforts. What torments us most at this time, and unless it is provided for in time, seems likely to ruin the churches in Germany, is not so much the accursed faction of the papists and open enemies, but the virulent malevolence of those who should have sweetly shared secrets and walked together in the house of God, who, as if the tyrants were not mad enough, and as if not enough Christian blood had been shed, present themselves as helpers and imitators of the tyrants' cruelty, while they incite princes against us and bring such great envy and hatred upon our churches throughout Germany, that the name of those whom they call Zwinglians and Calvinists stinks among many no less than those who should be denied the use of water, fire, and light. Although much is overcome by murmuring and enduring, and in a good cause and good conscience the firmest defense is rightly placed, especially since it has been in vain to contend with such minds so far, and nothing is more shameless than these people, whose weapons, as Nazianzen rightly writes, are quarrels: Yet both what has been done in Saxony and what Jacob Andreae, Illyricus, Selneccer, and other such ill-fated men are daily plotting, pave the way to civil war and the gravest disturbances, and these are now a great harm to all of us, and especially to our miserable and afflicted brothers in France and Belgium, it seems plainly necessary to our most illustrious elector and his counselors that all good men should contribute whatever help and counsel they can to extinguish this fire. For it can truly be said of these men, as was said of the glorious Nestorius in Constantinople, that they are the fire of faith, who today fill Germany with lamentable quarrels and discord. But you, most illustrious man, are well acquainted with the sense of those clamorous theologians, having often descended into the arena with them: and we, although invited by some to do so, have judged it not worthwhile to converse or meet again with Jacob Andreae, whom we judge to be condemned, and have found to be endowed with such a deceitful tongue that, while he speaks of peace with his mouth, in reality and in writing he sounds the trumpet of war. Here, however, the old and commonly used remedy for such controversies often occurs, namely a free and general synod, since, as Eusebius testifies in book 1 of the life of Constantine, great matters in the church could not be consulted upon except through synods. But when we remember again that the outcome of synods has always been most unfortunate, and the remedy often worse than the disease, unless men of sound and sober judgment have come together (of which Germany today has either few, or if it has, it shuns and persecutes them) or when some emperor of piety, merit, and authority, like Constantine of old, could keep the bishops in some moderation and duty: we scarcely see in this ulceration of minds what is to be hoped for from a synod, or how those who neither listen to reason nor to themselves, and who are more accustomed to bark than to dispute, will hear a synod.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the most illustrious elector, with his counselors and theologians, judges that no certain remedy remains at this time that would bring any effect, if you look at human means (for God will undoubtedly vindicate His truth from the world's furies excellently) than in these two things: first, that we give our utmost effort, as much as possible, to ensure that the princes, who, imbued with false suspicions, oppress us, understand the foundations of the cause, and that by some familiar and clear writing, of which you have published many most successfully, our opinion, its foundation, the cavils, absurdities, and fabrications of the enemies are opened to them: So that if they either do not understand some things or wish them to be explained to them, they might approach someone who could discuss the whole matter with them and remove all suspicions: and not always condemn us based on the prejudices of their theologians, and throw Germany into turmoil and civil war. Secondly, the most illustrious elector recognizes no more effective remedy in these evils, no greater bulwark against so many attacks for the whole cause, than the conspiring agreement of the churches, which profess the same opinion about the supper and are equally abominable to these coarse men, and the united defense of the cause in this matter: so that, since there is such a great consensus of all the impious today to attack the truth, we may be no less eager and consenting in defending the truth. Therefore, to blunt the acrimony of these men both in Saxony and in other places, and as a barrier or bridle to be placed on new tyranny, but especially to keep civil war, in which all things are usually miserable, far from Germany, the most illustrious elector judges that no milder or fairer way can be pursued than that the Queen of England, the King of Scotland, your most strong and ancient Republic, and the other cities in Switzerland, which are thus slandered under the name of Zwinglianism, the Polish and Hungarian churches, and if there are any others of like mind, should each send careful letters to the electors of Saxony and Brandenburg, and also to the Landgraves, in which they should complain gravely about these prejudices, dire invectives, and persecutions, which both renew old wounds and strengthen the tyrants raging everywhere, and that so many and such noble churches are condemned under these names of Zwinglianism and Calvinism, called into hatred, and that without any legitimate process, with the parties unheard, no synod intervening, but by the instigation of some unlearned and petulant theologians, who are not consistent with themselves in the very doctrine of the supper: and they should urge that such judgments be held in suspension until in a free synod the theologians of so many flourishing churches, who fight bravely against the papists and Arians, might be heard and come together at some time. But if even by these letters the princes are not moved, but, following the mind and petulance of their theologians, continue to remove and persecute our doctrine, so that nothing is left untried, and we try everything before we perish or are oppressed by the tyranny of these men, the most illustrious elector considers it most timely then for the aforementioned churches to institute some synod with ours: in which orthodox doctors may both confirm each other in true doctrine and seriously consider remedies for these discords; finally, that such a synod of ours may be opposed to the conventicles and condemnations of the adversaries. Moreover, esteemed brother, since you are almost the only one left from the veterans in this militia, and those foreign churches rightly hold you in the highest regard, the most illustrious elector kindly asks you through us not to hesitate to write as soon as possible to those churches, first to the magnates, then to the chief doctors about this matter, and to be an encourager for them to take up this cause from the heart.</p>
      <p>First of all, we pray that you may accomplish this with your most noble senate and the other church republics, so that they may be willing to send letters to the Saxon, Brandenburg, and Landgrave electors in that sense: so that the church may never be able to desire either zeal or care and diligence in us. We have also written to Mr. Beza about this matter, to incite those he knows to undertake this business. But we, reverend man, offering you our zeal and effort in all things, will continually pray to the Lord God that He may add strength to your old age, His blessings to your holy labors daily, and finally protect you in all things with your best and most venerable colleagues, whom we most lovingly greet with you. Heidelberg, November 21, 1574.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly in my own and my colleagues' name, Daniel Toussain.</p>
      <p>Concerning these matters, as they are most serious, the most illustrious elector has deemed it appropriate to write to you specifically and separately.</p>
