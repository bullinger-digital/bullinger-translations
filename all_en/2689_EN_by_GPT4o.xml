      <p>Greetings. Certainly, nothing is gained by rushing, and therefore, when I recently thought I had included the letters of the most excellent man, Mr. Welser, in your letters, I later realized that I was deceived by my excessive haste. However, I have now included them with this.</p>
      <p>Various rumors are being spread here, I do not know how truthfully. That crowd in Geneva keeps me anxious; I fear it may have an unfortunate outcome. The devil does not slumber; therefore, let us pray diligently. It is written from various places that there is great fear because of the Turkish war, which many think is to be renewed. We expect unfortunate things from our military; but with the glitter of gold and the speaking of the belly, ears are deaf and are not opened unless by some notable calamity. The messenger hurried so much that I could hardly write this to you. May the Lord Jesus keep you with all yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 8, 1555. Greetings to all the brothers. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, faithful minister of the church in Biel/Bienne, esteemed lord and my dearest brother.</p>
