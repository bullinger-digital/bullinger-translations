      <p>Greetings. I have received and understood well what you wrote and sent, and I realize that caution is needed in the future.</p>
      <p>Therefore, do not be anxious. I cannot do more now due to various tasks and a mind completely distracted. I am sending what I received yesterday from France, to reciprocate; for I acknowledge that your efforts in writing are great. We see that we must pray to God, that He may certainly moderate difficult matters according to His mercy.</p>
      <p>May all friends and brothers be well. Farewell together with your family. ZÃ¼rich, 17th of April, 1573.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor of the Church of Chur at St. Martin, his lord and brother.</p>
