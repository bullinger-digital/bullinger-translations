    <p xml:id="regest1">Leo [Jud], Theodor [Bibliander], [Konrad] Pellikan, [Georg] Binder, and others have read Vadian's ["Aphorisms"] and unanimously agree - especially Bibliander is full of praise - that they should be printed; Bullinger, equally impressed by the work, suggests dedicating it to the English king. In Basel, a four-volume edition of letters by Oecolampadius and Zwingli, along with their biographies and Bibliander's defense of their teachings, has been published. He requests news about the Emperor, the French king, and the Pope. He appreciated the opportunity to review Vadian's book. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your books, most learned Vadian, written on the consideration of the Eucharist, have been read by the chief ministers of our church, Leo [Jud], Theodor [Bibliander], Pellikan, Binder, and the others. What Leo and Pellikan think of them, they have abundantly testified in written letters. The others desire nothing more than for this pious, necessary, useful, and learned work to be published. Theodor, a man of the happiest genius and sharpest judgment, recently said to me, if I were to write to Vadian, I should expostulate with him, "that he suppresses books in every way most pious, most learned, and necessary for our age, and that he awaits my judgment, who am less than one whose judgment in such a learned work should be valued even a little; I certainly, if I could do anything with the most illustrious man, would wish that the most useful work be published." Thus far I have expressed Theodor's wishes and judgment. I, for my part, have not yet read anything in that sacramental conflict that has pleased me more, especially because of the excellent order of the matter, the manifold, pious, and incomparable erudition, and finally because of that holy simplicity and necessary abundance, moreover, and the pure, ancestral, apostolic antiquity. I therefore pray that you publish the most holy work at the earliest possible time. What if you were to dedicate the books to the most serene King of England? I will soon return them to you, so that you may hand them over to the printer after review. In the last three, I do not see what you could change; certainly, you will not give better ones, nor is there anything in the first three that seems to need changing so much.</p>
      <p>You know, I suppose, that four books of letters by Oecolampadius and Huldrych Zwingli have been printed in Basel, along with their lives and a defense of their teachings by Bibliander, where he also skillfully deals with the matter of the Eucharist.</p>
      <p>If you have written anything about the Emperor, the French king, and the Pope, you will have done a most gratifying thing. I give you as many thanks as I can, most esteemed and learned man, for finally making those books available to me. Believe me, nothing has ever happened to me more delightful.</p>
      <p>Farewell for a very long time. Bibliander, Utinger, and Binder wish you well.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 21, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Doctor Joachim Vadian, consul of St. Gallen, a man to be greatly respected.</p>
