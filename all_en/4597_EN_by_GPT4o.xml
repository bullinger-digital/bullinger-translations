      <p>Greetings. Today, your messenger first arrived here; now he departs again, so I could not meet any of the senators who have not yet dined. However, I hear from the senate that they are responding to your people; I also hear that our Diesbach himself will write to you. I have nothing else from France yet, except that the governance of the kingdom has been entrusted to Vendôme until the state of the kingdom convenes and they establish something certain about the administration of the kingdom henceforth. We hear no mention of the council; undoubtedly, the Lord has again miraculously scattered many of the enemy's plans through the king's death.</p>
      <p>Our people also hope that it will now be easier to negotiate with the Savoyard. We have nothing from Geneva.</p>
      <p>We had also heard that the inhabitants of the Val d'Angrogne were destroyed; but from our chief secretary Gyron, I have that this is false, and that they have indeed bought peace with a large sum of money. However, he could not report under what conditions this was done.</p>
      <p>I return the letters from Stettin and thank you. We also received letters from Augsburg these days containing almost the same things.</p>
      <p>The Palatine writes to Musculus and thanks him for the dedication of the Common Places. Through Erastus, he offers his services if necessary in the composition with Philibert of Piedmont. I am glad that our people are valued under him and that the truth is being promoted.</p>
      <p>Now someone has published certain places collected from the works of Melanchthon of blessed memory, with which he tries to prove that he wrote against us; thus it will happen that, while he was too much devoted to peace, he seems to have given occasion to greater disputes. For each party will try to defend itself with his authority.</p>
      <p>However, the most important thing is what he felt later, and even if this did not prevail, the truth prevails over all. May the Lord expand and propagate it throughout the whole world. Amen.</p>
      <p>The people of Freiburg have treated my lord very friendly, offered themselves exceedingly; words are good, but the outcome will prove the deeds. Farewell well, most esteemed man, indeed I pray from the heart that you may fare excellently; for I am sorry to hear that you are not well. May the Lord keep you safe for the needs of our churches for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>I pray for a most prosperous year for you and all yours. Musculus greets you, who also wrote to you these days.</p>
      <p>All friends and brothers greet you, especially Mr. Emanuel; I could not meet any of the others today.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 27, beginning of the year 61.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord and perpetual compatriot to be esteemed.</p>
