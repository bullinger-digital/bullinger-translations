      <p>Greetings. I had thought that you and my guest would have believed what I sincerely and truly wrote to you about his son, and I still think you did; I believe it should be acknowledged as paternal love if he feared I might conceal something. However, I would like you to consider that I neither knew anything more about the matter nor felt differently than what I wrote to you. But now there is something more certain that I can write to reassure the father's mind.</p>
      <p>Mendoza, who is quite well known here, was with me ten days ago. He confirmed to me that he saw that young man in Paris, and he knows the nobleman who took him away, and he intended to persuade him to leave the business and return to Switzerland. I greatly marvel at the ingratitude of that nobleman; but I do not think it should be feared that it will escalate to the point where any harm could occur from this.</p>
      <p>Three days ago, I wrote to my brother-in-law, the brother of Mr. Bassafontanei, to have the young man found (which will be very easy for him) and sent back with travel money, and not to allow him to wait there any longer. Perhaps another way will be found for the guest to recover his money... I will not allow him to lose anything if I can help it... whatever news you have, as you have begun, I would like you to share with me when you have the leisure. Our army in France is attacking the city and the very well-fortified and renowned fortress of Calais. It is the last remaining possession of the English from their long occupation; if it is captured, it will be a significant advantage for the rest of the war and a bulwark to keep the English off the entire continent in the future.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to write. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Freiburg, January 18, 1557, by our reckoning.</p>
      <p>Yours, Sanlaurentius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious theologian, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
