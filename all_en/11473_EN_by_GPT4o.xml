    <p xml:id="regest1">A councilman from Marburg will send this letter along with letters from Gwalther's fellow students from Constance to Zurich; his messenger is to stop by the father of [Johann Jakob] Wick and take the reply letters with him. There is much to report, but they are only rumors. The four Zurich students have been convinced that they should pursue the master's degree, as this is almost indispensable for traveling students; moreover, it is advantageous to bring home a certificate, and finally, knowledge of the liberal arts is also important for theologians. [Heinrich] Nüscheler is asked to lend him five guilders; next year he will be able to earn something himself through teaching. His "Monomachia" will be ready for the fair; Bullinger should write to him to whom he should dedicate this work as well as the "Epistolae heroinae." He will soon send his Epicedium on Eobanus [Hessus]. He requests Zwingli medals for Lonicerus and Rudolphi; Stampfer should also send him a corresponding drawing, as a bookbinder in Marburg wants to emboss Zwingli's portrait on book covers. Heinrich of Brunswick is said to be plotting something against Minden and Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse]; Melanchthon is in Worms; Emperor [Charles V] is said to be on his way to Germany; it is said that Sultan [Suleiman I] has died; according to not very credible rumors, Zurich is said to have defeated the Five Places. He asks him to comment on his plans and to intercede for him with Froschauer. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>It happened conveniently (most kind father) that a certain senator from Marburg, who was about to travel to Constance, promised to send himself as a messenger to you on our behalf; therefore, I have sent these letters of mine and those of my fellow students to you, so that you may immediately ensure they are delivered to their parents, so that we may all have a response through this same messenger. Please instruct the messenger to stop by the father of Wick; Wikius wrote that he should be provided with travel expenses and lodging at his home.</p>
      <p>There are many things, most esteemed father, that should be written, but they are such that, being spread here and there by the uncertain mouth of the crowd, they scarcely deserve belief from everyone.</p>
      <p>As for my affairs, I ask you to ensure that the help of good men is not lacking now. For now, at the behest and encouragement of the professors of this academy, and also at the urging of others, I have been led, along with my companions, to receive the master's degree together next year. Three others will receive the bachelor's degree (das Bakkalaureat) at the upcoming Bacchanalia festival, but I, being freed from this burden, will receive both the laureate and master's degree at the appointed time. I have been led to this not only by their encouragements but also by other significant reasons, the greatest of which is that I see this is especially beneficial for those who have once decided to visit foreign schools; I have experienced how much it hinders to lack a degree, both in others and in myself. Moreover, I believe our people will not take it amiss if someone receives public testimony of their study and labors, not to mention the diligence, care, and more vigilant study that is always present in those who are compelled to exhibit a public specimen of their studies. Therefore, I do not think you, considering these things more carefully, will be opposed to my undertakings. In the meantime, I am by no means forgetting my vocation, leaving theology (which is my primary study), but I am adding the knowledge of the arts, a thing not so much useful as necessary to this. For I see - and I wish it were more often - how unskilled theologians are in their own profession, who are deprived of the instruction of the liberal arts. But there is no need to discuss this with you, whose judgment in this matter is greater than to need my information.</p>
      <p>Now I would like to ask you, most kind father, to approach Nüscheler on my behalf, if perhaps through this messenger he would be willing to send and lend me five guilders; for I am pressed by extreme poverty. For from the money received from Froschauer, since I was forced to buy clothes and books, not much was left. I have recently written to you and to Nuscheler about sending money to the fairs; now I earnestly beg you to do so much that I may receive this through that messenger. I will certainly take care in good faith that your benefits do not seem to be bestowed on someone idle or ungrateful. After this year has passed (in which I must live less sordidly), I will be able to live with less expense, as I will have the opportunity to teach both publicly and privately. To which faculty I again and again beseech that your beneficence may be of assistance to me.</p>
      <p>As for the Monomachia, know that I have completed two books; I am now engaged in the third. I will bring all completed works with me to Frankfurt for the fairs; now write the names of those to whom it should be dedicated. In the meantime, also consider to whom you would like the "Epistolae heroinae" (which I will add to this) to be addressed. There are perhaps seven or eight, all of whose themes are taken from the sacred scriptures.</p>
      <p>I will soon send the Epicedium on Eobanus. Furthermore, I ask you to send me two silver images of H. Zwingli, at the lowest price they are found, either now or at the next fairs; for I would like to give one to Mr. M. Lonicerus, my private teacher, and the other to Caspar Rodolph, professor of dialectics, men who are very favorable to me and great lovers of our religion, as a gift. You will also ask Stampfer to deign to draw the same image with a pen. That he may draw it small with the pen in a roughly square form and send it through Froschauer to Frankfurt, for the bookbinder in Marburg wants to have it engraved in copper, so that it can be printed with gold on the books. Therefore, he should have it made in such a form that it can also be printed on smaller psalters. Please, with the respect you have for this man, take care of these things.</p>
      <p>I hear that Heinrich of Brunswick is plotting many things against Minden and Landgrave Philipp of Hesse. Philipp Melanchthon is in Worms. I have been told by some courtiers that the Emperor is coming to Germany to restore concord. The Sultan of the Turks, they say, has passed away. A rumor reached us that the Zurichers had clashed with the Five Places with successful outcome, and that five thousand of the enemy had fallen. But I believe it to be false, as no greater rumor has arisen.</p>
      <p>Please, dearest father, write back to me through this messenger, with what hope, plan, and assistance I should proceed in these my undertakings. Also, please ensure that Froschauer may be a friend and patron to me.</p>
      <p>Greet on my behalf your wife and mother with the whole family. Encourage Christian to write back. Farewell, most esteemed father, and assist with your help the one who hopes in you alone.</p>
      <p>Marburg, on the Ides of November 1540.</p>
      <p>Your most observant</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father and lord. In Zurich.</p>
