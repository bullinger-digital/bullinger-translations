      <p>My willing service and all good things beforehand.</p>
      <p>It is said here that the papal matter has come to arms, which, if true, would indeed sadden me, although dangerous diseases require dangerous remedies. But this is the effect of the accursed papal bull from Rome, which, wherever it comes, causes rebellion and unrest. It was the same in England, where a single bull caused two uprisings. Now it is written that on January 16th in England, the Duke of Norfolk, who was the head of the rebellion and wanted to handle the bull, was quartered, etc. However, I await more accurate reports from England from my friends, the bishops, as I hope to receive, etc. And I have not written to you in 14 days because I had to prepare many letters for Frankfurt, where Froschauer traveled today; he can deliver my letters to Hungary, Poland, England, the Netherlands, Hesse, Saxony, etc., where I otherwise cannot send them so well. Therefore, I apologize to you for not writing during this time, but I received your letter from which I understood well that it is a dangerous situation; and since I can do no better, I pray to God that He may direct it according to His grace. But the Gospel must be blamed for the unrest, even though it is clearer than the sun that all the blame lies with the Pope. What did he want by sending the hellish bulls among you? Why did he allow Francis Cellarius to be stolen and burned from foreign dominion? Why did he make knights and hang golden chains on them, except to cause rebellion among you?</p>
      <p>Thus, the Gospel is exonerated; all the blame is on the instigator, who deceives and confuses all lands. May the Lord judge him.</p>
      <p>These days I have received letters from the chancellery of Heidelberg of the Elector, stating that the King of France has sent a stately embassy, the Lord de la Faye, to seek and woo the friendship of the Elector, and that the King has openly declared that he wants to protect the peace, etc., and that the embassy was held and received with great honor. It is also written to the Elector from Brussels in the Netherlands that the Duke of Alba demands the tenth penny from the lands. The land does not want to do this, and the commerce stands still, and the citizens keep their shops closed. The Duke of Alba has ordered them to open under threat of hanging; but this has not happened, instead, the guilds have sent their guild masters to the town hall to plead for the waiver of the tenth penny; and as they were detained a little longer at the town hall, the entire community gathered in front of the town hall, refusing to leave until the masters came out. Thus, they were soon released to them.</p>
      <p>The citizens, however, have gathered in the courtyard of the late Count Egmont; the Duke of Alba, however, has quickly departed and traveled to Antwerp to the citadel. What will come of it, God knows, who may deliver the oppressed!</p>
      <p>Also, I have received a letter these days, written at Blois at the King's court in France on February 11th, stating that the King came from Amboise to Blois with his court on February 4th. Cardinal Alexandrin, the papal and Spanish ambassador, was received with great ceremony, wanting to bring the King into a holy league against the Turks and to prevent the Navarrese marriage, etc.</p>
      <p>The embassy was dismissed with good words, and in summary: it achieved nothing. However, the Queen of Navarre came with her court to Tours and was to enter Blois on February 13th or 14th. The old Queen, with her sons, along with the entire royal court, is preparing to receive the Queen of Navarre. And there is much triumph. There, the marriage between the young King of Navarre and the King's sister, Car[oli], is to be concluded, and another proposal is to be made between the young Prince of Cond√© and the Duke of Anjou's daughter, and many other such things.</p>
      <p>The admiral is not at court at this time, but is held in great esteem by the King. It is thought that he will now also come with the Queen of Navarre, and that the Gospel, along with the evangelical good place and peace, which greatly displeases the cardinal and priests, will be upheld. Praise be to God; may He further the well-being of His church and break the murderous practices of the Pope, etc. Such, dear sir and brother, I have in haste, and since I have it from certain places and honorable people, I wanted to share it with you; you may also share it with other good lords and friends to your liking and kindly greet my lords the mayors and other my lords, also Mr. Campell, Pontisella, Mr. Goryus, Bonet, and other acquaintances. In these wondrous times and events, let us earnestly call upon God to bless us and protect us from all evil, to maintain a common praiseworthy confederation in His grace and unity.</p>
      <p>God be with you and your household. All mine greet you. Given in Zurich, March 14, 1572.</p>
      <p>Bullinger the Elder.</p>
