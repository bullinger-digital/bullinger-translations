      <p>Greetings. You indeed praise, most esteemed man, those small duties of mine magnificently; but I attribute this to your exceptional kindness.</p>
      <p>For in me and mine there is nothing to marvel at, and your deeds are greater than I can match. However, you will always find me grateful and benevolent. No one is suspect to me, as if he relieves his bile with partisanship, who predicts that the plans and institutions of the Emperor will someday burst forth with lamentable and bitter consequences, with the ruin of many good people; for he has long been known to me by his virtues. Indeed, I believe I have observed from the beginning of his reign his bloody deeds, so that I do not consider myself to have been or to be negligent among my peers.</p>
      <p>I remember by what means from the beginning he drove our people mad through the work of his chosen instrument, the Bishop and Cardinal of Sitten (Sion), and led them against our confederates with a just army into the territory of Milan, and so managed his affairs that within a few years, having expelled the French, he made Italy his own, having received and given so many disasters in the meantime, so many funerals, with famine, plague, and betrayals laid low, that not even Ilium (Troy) gave or received more evils. What he planned in France with Narbonne, with Belgium, I would be foolish to boast before you, if I were to proceed to recount to one so knowledgeable of calamities. In Germany, indeed, which he often calls his dear fatherland, what did he plan? How many strong legions did he lead out from it, which he lost with utmost ambition in Hungary and Bourbon? For he also found foreign kingdoms, which he used as slaughterhouses to destroy foolish Germans. Of the royal resources and treasures utterly exhausted partly by force and wickedness, partly by deceit and arts, I do not even mention. His outstanding examples of piety towards his fatherland are evident in Ghent, in the duchies of Gelderland and Württemberg, and that in recent years he could both introduce and watch foreign and external soldiers, cruel, shameless, and most impious, raging most savagely in the bowels of Germany and mixing heaven and earth in this. If I were to begin to discuss the confusion of religions and the Jeroboamic ventures, time, paper, and ink would sooner fail me than the material for speaking. Magdeburg, another Bethulia, will proclaim to posterity the virtues of this Holofernes or Nebuchadnezzar.</p>
      <p>That bloody dissension, which today burns in Germany and falls with mutual wounds and mutual fires and devastations, will someday recognize its true author. Today we almost all are blind; but this is our fate, this is what our sins deserve.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Sennacherib, Belshazzar, and Antiochus have their judge. I do not recount these things to you to gratify this prince who favors little, but so that you may see that I have long known the arts of that man and observe his deeds. I observe also the deeds of other kings and princes, even of your nation, nor do I think I abuse that observation, who can apply my teaching indeed sought from the word of God (for what is done today, of which we do not have excellent examples and most illustrious types in the scriptures?) aptly to present affairs, advising to follow those things which are salutary, and to flee those which destroy, invoking at the same time divine aid, without which all things, however flourishing they may be, wither for man. But perhaps I am more troublesome to you with my loquacity than is proper.</p>
      <p>I received letters from Lyon dated August 28. They announce that four men, on account of their purer religion, are to be burned by the work of that most truculent Cardinal of Tournon this week, who nevertheless, constant in faith, were worthy of a better fate. But your most powerful king is unfortunate in this part, who entrusts and leaves power to bloody men and will not escape the heavy hands of God. For although the pontiffs and priests had handed Christ over to Pilate, Pilate still hears from the Lord: "He who delivered me to you has the greater sin." May the Lord have mercy on the king.</p>
      <p>I received letters from Augsburg dated around the end of August and written by a great man, indicating that a serious rivalry is being exercised between the Emperor and Ferdinand on account of the Spanish prince, whose side the marquis supports with some, the better part of the Germans adhering to Ferdinand, and thus a treaty has already been struck between Ferdinand and some electors. The same adds that in Lower Germany 23 ships have arrived in support of the Emperor, I know not which, etc.</p>
      <p>Letters brought from Strasbourg mention nothing else than that Germany is miserably torn by factions and the more prudent expect I know not what new disturbances to arise. They add that with the king in England deceased, Mary has been made queen; but that the course of religion will remain free as hitherto, and what has been established will be kept intact. But also that the young king of Scotland is to be joined in marriage to Mary, and this by the consent and command of the nobles of the kingdom, and he himself imbued with the doctrine of true piety.</p>
      <p>These things they have I know not from where; they find little faith with me, since I have never heard that the Scots have a young king, unless they have now created him, which is not likely. They say the queen, who is in France, is the heir of the kingdom. But I expect more certain things; for shortly I think I will have letters from England itself. Meanwhile, if you have received anything certain about the affairs of Africa, Tunis, and maritime and Italian matters, I pray you would deign to share it. Live and farewell. Zürich, September 8, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
