      <p>S. P. Because you have not received anything from me for many days nor have I responded to yours, I ask you to excuse me; for you know, in this tumult of wars, with what occupations I am detained. Our Vergerius wrote to me and sent for you those things which you will find here. I have nothing else new from Germany, except that the Emperor is entirely thinking about promoting his son in England and Germany; he is expected every hour in Flanders. The assemblies have been postponed, as you know, I believe; the princes promise us much about their constancy, may it be so.</p>
      <p>But since I see that they lack the head and sinews of war, I fear with you their so frequent meetings. Among us, arms are everywhere and hope in... he... was with the king to obtain peace or a truce; but immediately we sensed the Emperor's arts; thus, with the matter unfinished, he was sent back and is now in Flanders with his Emperor, who promises him the papacy. I greet the lords and you uniquely. Farewell, most excellent man. From Solothurn, April 24th.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bassefontaneus.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
