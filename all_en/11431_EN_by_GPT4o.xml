    <p xml:id="regest1">He has learned from Bullinger's letter that he should not stay in Basel, but regrets that no decision has yet been made about his future place of study; the admonition related to Basel was unnecessary. He urges a quick decision for cost reasons, but is disinclined towards Tübingen and instead suggests Marburg. He cannot afford a stay in Tübingen and does not understand why he, who has no private means, is prohibited from foreign services. Oporin was deprived of his teaching position; possibly the same measure will be taken against Grynäus. He is satisfied with the students from Zurich, especially with Christian [Wirth]; he lectures Euclid to him and Christoph [Rotacher]. Greetings. He asks for a letter of recommendation.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received the long-awaited letter, most kind father, from which I understood your opinion. However, I wish I had understood more clearly not only that I should leave Basel, but also to which place I should go; however, as you write, this has not yet been decided by our people. I did not receive with a heavy heart your fatherly advice about leaving Basel. It is very comforting to know that I am of such concern to you, as I have often felt before and now also understand. Although, what is feared here poses no danger. I swear by God, who knows both me and my mind, that I am now in such a state as I have hardly ever been better, and I would not hide this from you, especially such an important matter, whom I consider to be the only harbor of my salvation. I certainly have examples of our young men that frighten me not a little, and I am greatly moved by them.</p>
      <p>Finally, I will take care (if God wills) not to perish, submerged in the same mire. However, your admonition was by far the most pleasing to me.</p>
      <p>As for the state of my affairs, I wish that you would deliberate as quickly as possible, so that I do not prolong my stay here (if indeed I must leave) and deplete my financial resources. However, I earnestly request this one thing, that you do not force me to go to Tübingen; for some reason, I have an aversion to this school, and my mind predicts nothing good if I go there. There are other schools far superior to this one, to which, if you send me, perhaps no inconvenience will arise. There is Marburg, which I hear is flourishing in letters; if you order me to go there, I will do so willingly, and you will not see me opposing you more obstinately. The cost of living is also lower there. I have already tasted the customs of that country to some extent. As for religion, it is no worse than Tübingen. Although I would like you to believe this, I have long since laid the foundations of my religion. I am touched by the piety of my homeland no less than anyone else, so there is no occasion to fear that my mind will be corrupted by foreign religion, provided the Lord does not deny His grace.</p>
      <p>However, I would like you to carefully consider what expenses I can bear. If I go to Tübingen, it will not be possible to live. I have here 15 florins, which Quirinus handed over, less than half; whether I can live on this until December, you yourself will judge, since at least 26 must be spent annually on living expenses, and a room and bed must also be rented. Where are the clothes, where are the books, which certainly must be bought? It is indeed (as you write) a royal stipend; but it is also royal to redeem a person's freedom with money, than which we can have nothing more excellent, especially when I clearly see that you are of such an institution that you do not wish to give me any opportunity to accept any condition, although I cannot live in Tübingen on this stipend. A not-to-be-despised condition was offered to me in Geneva, which you refused, which would have taken up perhaps two hours daily; the rest of the time was left free for me. However, I do not quite understand what your opinion is. I am denied what was granted to Frisius, Otto, Niver, Gessner, and finally to all before me, although I am the poorest of all of them. What I had from my mother, however little it was, you know how I was forced to spend it, since 25 florins had to be paid to my stepfather, and the schoolmaster only counted 16. When I had spent this and could no longer devote myself to studies, no help was given by them, so that, as far as they were concerned, I would have had to abandon my studies, if you, showing a father's affection, had not taken me into your home, which you know better than I do. Therefore, I can certainly affirm that I was educated not so much by them as by you; for you provided that I could devote myself to studies without hindrance. However, I would not want you to think me so impious as to want to serve foreigners rather than my homeland; I understand what I owe to my homeland, nor do I want to benefit foreigners to the detriment of my homeland. I ask you, however, to be so kind as to act on my behalf, so that I may obtain the opportunity to help my homeland through them.</p>
      <p>The same is paid to others, as you write, and no more. I admit; however, you also know that the three who are in Tübingen also have help from elsewhere. None of them would sell their own advantage, which they have from their own, for 15 florins, of which I have not even the slightest hope. Of the others who have been abroad before me, there is none who did not have a very ample condition.</p>
      <p>I alone am left destitute, as if the most unfortunate of all. However, I do not want to complain about this to others; I entrust this necessity of mine to you alone, as to a unique father, and I do not doubt that, having carefully considered these matters, you will be most fair to my opinion. I only ask that you do not allow a longer delay in such a serious matter; for the longer it is prolonged, the more the present money decreases.</p>
      <p>The school here is in turmoil in a remarkable way. Oporin has been deprived of his teaching position; many threaten the same for Grynaeus, some say it is almost done; but the matter is still secret.</p>
      <p>The young men sent here are making good progress; I am pleased with their manners and studies, especially Christian's, who excels all in simplicity of mind, humility, and modesty of manners, although I have no complaints about the others. I have begun to lecture the first book of Euclid to Christian and Christoph, and I hope this study will succeed for them.</p>
      <p>Greet on my behalf your wife and mother with the whole family, and also your brother Johann, my most sincere friend. Farewell, dearest father, and take this freedom of my writing in good part.</p>
      <p>From Basel, from the house of Mr. Myconius, 6th day before the calends of May 1540. Your most observant</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>Wherever you send me, please ensure that I do not come without a recommendation, if I have indeed deserved to be recommended by you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful head of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed father. Zurich.</p>
