    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks Bullinger for the efforts to free him from the purgatory of his position in Schaffhausen. However, he feels too uneducated to succeed such a learned man as Karlstadt, and too weak to meet the demands of the position. Yet, trusting in Bullinger's promises, he will obey. Asks for advice on how to manage his release in Schaffhausen. He will need financial assistance for the move to Zurich. Joachim will discuss everything with Bullinger.</p>

      <p>Grace and a life of innocence.</p>
      <p>I cannot help but express my immense gratitude to you for remembering me and attempting to liberate me from the purgatory of the patrician cave. However, I do not greatly approve of the way you are attempting this. For when I consider the mediocrity, indeed the smallness of my intellect, I clearly do not recognize in myself the strength to bear such a burden. Furthermore, I am greatly hindered and deterred by the fact that I am too uneducated to be substituted in the place of such a learned man. I would not refuse any labor for the glory of the Lord, which I could undertake according to my modest abilities. But this seems greater to me than I can bear. I do not find such shoulders in myself. But because I have always complied with your wishes until now, I will also comply this time, not relying on my own intellect, but on your promise, in which you say: "If you come, we will show you all goodness, all loyalty, love, and friendship." Under this condition, this law, and this agreement, I will consent to your request. However, I lack a certain plan on how to approach the matter of seeking permission. Therefore, I am sending you a document of my condition, detailing the agreement I have with the people of Schaffhausen. If you examine it carefully, you might have some ready advice. For as far as I understand, they have agreed with me in such a way that I can now easily leave without scandal. But I will await your opinion on this matter. The sixth article should be well considered by you. Once you have deliberated, write back and return the document of my agreement with the people of Schaffhausen along with your letter, and also instruct me on what I should do. Moreover, although I am already prepared and ready for the journey, I am not so financially equipped that I can now adequately prepare the expenses for the journey and the transportation of my belongings. For in the past year, I spent all my money that I had at hand, so that this year I have only been able to live day by day. Therefore, assistance will also be needed here. But why do I dwell on these matters, etc. Joachim, our dearest brother, will discuss everything else with you.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>June 13.</p>
      <p>Beat Gering, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, M. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
