      <p>Greetings in Christ, most illustrious Mr. Bullinger, and dearest brother in the Lord! I sincerely thank you for receiving my letters with such a grateful heart; likewise, I also thank you for your homilies on Isaiah, which I received through Mr. Johann Abel. To your letters sent in September through Wiburn, but delivered by another, Mr. Wintoniensis and I responded at the last Frankfurt fair; and I hope you have already received those letters.</p>
      <p>Regarding the publication of the letter on the vestment issue, I indeed knew that you did not write it to be published; but because I foresaw with certainty that great benefit would result for our churches from its publication, I persuaded myself that you would bear this with equanimity.</p>
      <p>Our affairs are almost in the same state as they have been until now. We now have with us the Count of Stolberg, a German, as an envoy from Emperor Maximilian. He is requesting (as I hear) an annual financial subsidy for the Turkish war. But it seems he will not obtain anything here unless other kingdoms and provinces contribute collectively. There is also some talk of a marriage between our queen and Charles of Austria; but in every negotiation, religion is always considered. Therefore, unless Charles is willing to renounce papism, he has nothing to hope for here. Scotland has now fallen into new disturbances. Henry, recently King of Scotland (as I suppose you have heard), was found dead on February 10th last in a garden adjacent to his lodging (which he had outside the court). There is not yet agreement among all about the manner of his death.</p>
      <p>Some say that several barrels of gunpowder, which had been placed under the room where he was sleeping, were ignited, causing the building to collapse and him to be thrown into the nearby garden. Others truly affirm that he was forcibly taken from his room in the dead of night, strangled afterward, and then the gunpowder was ignited, causing the building to be destroyed. A certain count named Bothwell was suspected by everyone of this murder. After this count repudiated his legitimate wife with the authority of the Archbishop of St. Andrews intervening, the Queen of Scotland married him on May 15th and created him Duke of Orkney from the Count of Orkney. Shortly before this marriage, almost all the nobles of the kingdom, seeing that no inquiry into the king's murder was being conducted, left the court and held a separate assembly at the town of Stirling. In this assembly, it was discovered with certain evidence that this heinous murder was perpetrated by Bothwell. Therefore, they are striving to capture him with a gathered army: Bothwell, however, flees; but where he has fled is still unknown. Some say the queen is besieged in a certain castle; others assert that she is held captive in Edinburgh Castle, as an accomplice in her husband's murder. However it may be, those infamous nuptials cannot but end in some dire tragedy. But we expect more certain information about all these things daily, about which I will soon make sure you are informed.</p>
      <p>I write nothing about the Flemish persecutions, as I assume they are not unknown to you. Much has been said among us about Geneva being besieged; but I hope these are false. May the Lord Jesus preserve your piety safe for us and the church!</p>
      <p>London, June 21, 1567.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to you in the Lord, Edmund Grindal, Bishop of London.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend in Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the Church of Zurich and dearest brother in Christ. In Zurich.</p>
