      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear friend. We have received your sent Latin and German copies of the little book dedicated to us, with gracious thanks for this and other favors, showing your kind intentions regarding the aforementioned book. We hereby send you a sample of our wine, as good as we have at this time. If we could be with our own at Reichenweier (Riquewihr), we might have improved it, graciously asking you to consider our current situation and how our affairs unfortunately stand now, and to regard or consider our kind intentions more than the work itself; for we are well-disposed towards you, etc. We sent you such and similar letters on the 3rd of April with the carrier who transported the wine. Now we hear that the wine has arrived in Zurich, but the letter has been lost (as the innkeeper at the Rappen here reported today, also asking to know from you if the wine has been damaged), therefore the wine has not been delivered to you until now. If you have a claim to it, you can inquire about it with the carriers. We did not want to withhold our gracious intentions from you. Dated Schaffhausen, the 10th of April, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] o[f] Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
