      <p>It is true that the Turks are causing much damage to the Viennese territory with their raids.</p>
      <p>The Pope, however, at the request of Philipp, is going to recognize Ferdinand as the elected emperor, albeit with the dignity of the Roman See preserved; now the question is, what should be done to ensure that dignity is preserved. He is fully committed to reforming the clergy, but he has not yet agreed to do justice to Charles V, as he claims that Charles died outside the peace of the Roman Church because he did not return the empire he received from it, as he no longer wished to use it. Charles himself died on October 21st in Zaragoza... it is said, because he heard at the same time about the loss of Thionville in France and the slaughter of Spaniards in Africa during the Algerian expedition. The Philippians had hoped to seize Casale, a principal place in Montferrat, through treachery, and when they approached and applied ladders, they were repelled by artillery, realizing they had been betrayed, and left with the loss of nearly forty of their own. It is also reported that the Italian leaders, in the name of Philipp, namely the Florentine and the Ferrarese, have been urged to fulfill the agreements they owe to Philipp, since he has already fulfilled all his part; what these are is not very clear. Nothing certain is yet reported about peace; however, there was a rumor in Lyon, as the courier reported, that everything had been settled without regard to the English. There are also those who affirm that Philipp, already certain of the death of the Queen of England, his sister, to whom the kingdom devolves, is seeking marriage; however, she still abhors this marriage. A certain ridiculous thing was also reported, not unworthy of knowing: when the emperor entrusted the perpetual care of many provinces to Maximilian, his firstborn, for this reason, many signs of joy were customarily displayed, especially the jousts, as they call them, in which one troop of knights, under the guise and scheme of priests, clashed. Finally, when the lances were broken and they had to resort to swords, they used certain instruments in the form of books, which, when opened and torn, released from their belly playing cards, pebbles, dice, gaming boards, dice, and all other things of that sort, with which the entire area was covered to the great laughter of the spectators. Ferdinand was also watching, who at first was amazed at the thing, then burst into laughter with the others, but then, considering that it was a disgrace to the priestly order, he rushed out of the podium, even closing the window, and indignantly added: "God give evil to these wicked ones," referring to his other sons, the authors of these games, "all agree with Maximilian in left-handed persuasion."</p>
