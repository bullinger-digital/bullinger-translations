      <p>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you. Do not doubt the faith and tolerance of Erb, most esteemed Heinrich in Christ, because I have not responded to your exhortations, in which you have abundantly demonstrated your duty of charity towards me. There is a reason to excuse myself; but with a brother, I do not need an apology. Certainly, I have bathed twice since August, first outside in the Fochspergian baths, then at home for several days according to the doctors' prescription. What benefit these baths have brought me can now be seen in my limping old age. I rarely go out in public, not out of fear, but because of the many and vain discomforts of the body, and especially because of old age, which is itself a disease. I often cry out with St. Paul: "Wretched man that I am; who will deliver me?" And with the prophet: "It is enough for me, take, I pray, my soul, yet let your will be done," etc. I have been under the care of a surgeon for almost six months now, who promises to alleviate the pain in my feet and the purulent wounds. But a good, cool earth would now be healthy for me, my dear Bullinger. These are briefly about my health.</p>
      <p>Now indeed, it would be worthwhile to report something about the state and affairs of the church, and I would do this more often if it were safe to commit them to letters. The adversaries observe everything. With us (praise be to God) nothing has changed, nor have we deviated by a finger's breadth from the truth, which is in Christ Jesus, from the true sacraments and customs and ceremonies approved by the word of God, which, as you know, I believe, are instituted with us no differently than with you. Meanwhile, the Bishop of Strasbourg and Basel are pressing the interim business; but we do not comply.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Strasbourg is pressing very hard through some suborned scoundrels, plotting to intrude papist priests into the three churches belonging to his diocese; but the prince and we, resisting, defeat him with his own weapon; for we demand that such be sufficient as Caesar admitted with the states of the empire; but they are found nowhere. Even if he offered such, they would first be examined by our magistrate; hence many are deterred. Here is an example of this: There is a certain nobleman from Ruost, the patron of our church in Bischwihr; he offered a certain most wicked scoundrel. But when he was to be examined, he renounced the church. The Ferdinandists have confiscated from our people the yield of this year from vineyards, fields, meadows, as well as debts and taxes that are outside the boundaries and limits of this dominion. The senior duke is striving to settle the matter as best he can; the citizens, however, admonished by us, bear it patiently, although there are also seditious ones who would prefer to settle the matter with fists; but they fear the magistrate. Last week, the Bishop of Strasbourg consulted with the magistrate for three days in the city. Today Hedio writes to me that on the 26th of this month, the most welcome guests of the bishop will again meet in the city at Tabernas; I fear that while they consult and deliberate, Christ, God forbid, may be exiled, especially since the tribunes of the people do not agree among themselves, not to mention the preachers, etc. About which I wish you knew as certainly as I do; you could, I believe, predict the future state of that city. The Bishop of Besançon, or rather the administrator, sent two envoys to Montbéliard to Duke Christopher a month ago, commanding by the authority of Caesar, under the pretext, to send away our Tossanus, and then to restore not interimists, but the most papist priests. The pious duke did not want to, but having obtained a delay, he referred the matter to his parent. What he will answer, we do not know. But Tossanus, our brother, commendable in many respects in Christ Jesus, writes to me that he will admit nothing against the glory of God and his son Jesus Christ, but would rather shake off the dust of his feet. Nothing is heard of Caesar; he is buried and is meditating elegiac poems, etc. We will see soon, let others say whatever they want, the thoughts of a cunning mind. I wanted to send this to you, so you would not think I had forgotten you, my Bullinger, praying you and your brothers to mention us in your indefatigable prayers, so that our faith may not fail.</p>
      <p>We are attacked on all sides because of impenitence and rightly suffer, having been kindly visited by God so far because of ingratitude, etc. I am forced to shorten my hand. Farewell and greet all the brothers in the Lord, especially my Pellicanus, with whom I have a contest because of old age, etc., also Gualther, Bibliander, our Gerold, and the rest.</p>
      <p>Riquewihr, November 19.</p>
      <p>Your Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>Nicholas Regulus greets you and all the brothers. When Erb and I go over the Gemme more, we will call you, so that you may join us for the evening blessing in the middle of the white snow, to refresh yourself with a cool glacier.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant churchman of the city of Zurich, his ever-observant lord.</p>
