    <p xml:id="regest1"> [1] Here, a man [Hans Wylle, known as Bapst] is causing a scandal in our church! He betrayed his wife [...] with the maid [Anna Bippe], who became pregnant. He left his wife helpless and gave everything he earned to the harlot, so that the wife had to rely on others for her livelihood! Markus [Bertschi] gave her a Basel pound, which was reimbursed to him by the head guild master [Blasius Sch√∂lli or Marx Heidelin]. The Basel council allowed [Wylle] to leave the marital home because they feared an act of revenge from the [step]son [...]. And so [Wylle] showed his goodwill [only] to the harlot! Illness, sorrow, and further misfortune brought the wife to her death. The adulterer took the harlot in, as he had promised her marriage. He asked both Myconius and the marriage court and the council to recognize his new marriage, but this was denied to him. The council finally informed him that they would not forbid him from living with [Bippe], but he would have to leave the city for it. So [Wylle] went to Mulhouse, where the official [Philipp Blunder] of the Basel bishop Philipp von Gundelsheim recognized the marriage. After a few months, [Wylle] regretted his emigration and asked the Basel council for readmission. This was granted to him, but not the exercise of his former public office. The matter was presented to the marriage court, which deliberated on it and decided not to recognize the marriage and to prohibit [Wylle] from participating in communion. This judgment angered both the council and the people, so that something bad is to be feared. This is confidential. Bullinger should communicate his opinion on the case and the decision of the marriage court as soon as possible! </p>
    <p xml:id="regest2"> [2] Why has Bullinger not written anything about the news that Vadian transmitted to Basel? The news seems credible. May the Lord continue to stand by Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony as before! Philipp of Hesse is still undecided. He lacks money, and his nobility is said to plan to abandon him. Yet he is more willing to die than to abandon his faith and his allies. </p>
    <p xml:id="regest3"> [3] The population of Strasbourg has still not heard anything about the conditions of a peace [between the Strasbourg council and Emperor Charles V]. Yet there is already fear that it is over for the Gospel. </p>

      <p>S. There is a man here who is causing a scandal in our church in this way: While his wife was alive, he seduced the maid and made her pregnant. He left his wife without support and assistance. Whatever he earned from daily labor, he gave to the harlot, until the wife was forced to seek help elsewhere to sustain her life. Markus gave her one Basel pound, which was later reimbursed by the head guild master. He also left his wife with the permission of the council because of the wife's son, whose anger was feared. He showed his goodwill to the harlot. Meanwhile, the wife was consumed by illness, sorrow, and many other misfortunes. The adulterer married the harlot, to whom he had promised marriage before. He asked to be admitted (by the consistory, by us, and by the council) for what he had done; however, he asked in vain. Finally, the council passed this sentence: If you want to have her as your wife, we do not oppose it. However, we do not want you to live among us. Therefore, he moved to Mulhouse and obtained from the official of our bishop that he could have the harlot as his legitimate wife, and thus he received the blessing in the papist church. After a few months, he regretted his migration. Therefore, he petitioned our council to be allowed to return to the city. It was permitted, but not to be restored to the public office he previously held. The matter came to us. We consulted and concluded: he (whose marriage we cannot approve so far, nor do we approve yet) should be prohibited from the Lord's table! Upon learning this, we moved the council and the people to horror at the thought. This is confidential to you. We seek from you what you think about this marriage and our advice, and we beseech you to send a response as soon as you can.</p>

      <p>Besides this, I wonder why you have not sent us the news that Vadian wrote, since it is so credible? May the Lord be with the Elector as before! Philipp of Hesse is still undecided. He does not have money, and his nobles are said to be planning defection. Yet he himself would rather die than accept what is offered to him against religion and allies.</p>
