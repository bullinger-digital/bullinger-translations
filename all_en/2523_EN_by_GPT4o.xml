      <p>God be with you, dear brother-in-law. Your behavior and actions displease me more and more. You call yourself by your noble family name Adlischwyler, take the name Adelschwyler, and thus present yourself to those who do not know you as of high nobility; but to those who know you, your situation is such that you are thrown into various prisons and treated unlawfully. If your imprisonment were demanded by a single adversary, one might think it could be a setup. But you have been imprisoned in your own fatherland, in the town of Rheinfelden, then taken by the government of Ensisheim, and now locked up by the lord of the castle of Rheinfelden; from whose prison you have now broken out and escaped, so that he now has the right against you, as it is called in law, violati carceris, which is also very serious, whereby you have forfeited your life, honor, body, and goods, if you had any. With this, you have also adorned your newly assumed nobility with a wild disgrace, which would certainly be a sin and always a hindrance to you, if you had bravely awaited the right in prison. The one who imprisoned you with suspicion would have had to release you with honor; now it stands as you can think yourself; you bring your old, gray father and all of us into great sorrow, burden, and disgrace.</p>
      <p>Would to God, you had honored your father more and allowed yourself to live peacefully and obediently in your dear fatherland, to serve and maintain yourself in simplicity and honesty. Such would have brought more peace to the good old father and more benefit and praise to you than now, with the new nobility, you want to be among princes and lords, who themselves are not rich nor have much surplus, and at whose courts the letters of nobility are not worth much, since they well know how easily the letters of nobility are sometimes given, to become rich.</p>
      <p>Here I know well that I will not find you without an answer and that you are well-prepared with many counterarguments. But as I have always had a distaste for much chatter, I would like the deeds to be better, which also proclaim good and love, so that they also say something, and you would not have to speak so much, yes, not always have the state, government, and nobility against you.</p>
      <p>If you had followed my advice as before, you would have truly turned to God, prayed for grace, that He might help you out of these matters and otherwise, you would have also endeavored to repent and, as you could have obtained your livelihood and bread in simplicity and honesty, have had consideration.</p>
      <p>For I fear, in the long run, your arrogant behavior will not turn out well, but I hope, if you truly conduct yourself in humility, God will help you. With this, be commended to God. Dated Zurich, January 5, 1555. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his dear brother-in-law Hans Jakob Adlischwyler now in Ottenbach.</p>
