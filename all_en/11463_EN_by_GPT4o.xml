    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for a letter; both he and the colleagues who arrived from Tübingen will receive money from Froschauer, and if necessary, he will ask [Christian] Egenolff for help, as plague and the threat of war loom. For the planned study of the [Apostolic] letters, Bullinger's commentary is now available to him. He wants to complete the poetry inspired by Bullinger by the next fair; he has begun to compose biblical "Epistolae heroinae" and sends the letter of Sarah as a sample. He asks to review the poem [“Ecclesiastomoria”] by Pollius and suggests possible authors for a dedication epigram. He hopes that Eobanus [Hessus], whose portrait he sends, can complete his “Fasti” despite severe illness, and includes his poem “De casu Moguntiaco.” Comments on the book offerings at the Frankfurt fair; sends Melanchthon's “De anima” as well as a riddle book [by Johannes Lorichius]. Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] persists in his [morganatic marriage]; Dionysius [Melander], who read Bullinger's letter with sadness, supports the Landgrave together with the preacher of Melsungen [Johannes Lening], which is not surprising given Melander's own marital circumstances. Luther, Philipp [Melanchthon], and Duke [Ernst] of Lüneburg are troubled by the Landgrave's behavior; a theologian has bravely opposed him, and there have been several attempts to abduct his morganatic wife. Brunswick can count on the support of the Hanseatic cities in the conflict with Duke Heinrich; they are besieging the fortresses of the pirate Balthasar [von Esens]. There is little to report about [Christian III], Emperor [Charles V], [Francis I], and [Suleiman I]. The King of England [Henry VIII] has repudiated [Anne of Cleves] and married [Catherine Howard]; he also had Thomas Cromwell as well as [Robert] Barnes and two other preachers, but also three papists executed, as Richard Hilles reported. Nicholas [Partridge] has not come [to Frankfurt], which fills Gwalther with concern, as it is dangerous to leave England without permission; students are only allowed to travel to Leuven or Paris. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your most kind letter in Frankfurt, most esteemed father, which was very pleasing to me because I recognized your unwavering affection towards me, as always. Both I and the colleagues who have unexpectedly arrived here from Tübingen will receive the money from Froschauer. You will understand that I have not been the greatest spender of all those who have been sent here so far, if you consider the expenses of these people. Since I am uncertain when either war or plague might drive us away, I have decided, following Christoph's advice, to arrange with Egenolff that he provides money if necessary. The plague has begun to spread almost throughout Hesse; it is expected in Marburg daily. Rumors of war are spreading everywhere, and in several places, troops are gathering. May the Lord God ensure that all things end for the glory of His name. As for us, I will diligently ensure that we live here with as little expense as possible, and finally, that no time is wasted.</p>
      <p>This winter, I have decided to read all the letters with the utmost diligence, and for this purpose, I have received your work from Froschauer.</p>
      <p>If God wills, I will complete the theme of our poem by the next fair. I have also begun to compose "Epistolae heroinae" in imitation of Ovid, with themes drawn from the Bible.</p>
      <p>This seems to exercise the precepts of both rhetoric and dialectics; it certainly sharpens the judgment of invention wonderfully. I am sending the first sample of my exercise, this letter of Sarah, which you see, and if it pleases you, I may add others. Froschauer has received Pollius's poem; if you read it, I do not think you will find anything lacking in it. However, both the author himself and his friends request that it be recommended with some Greek tetrastich in the front.</p>
      <p>Collinus could provide this. If he is unwilling, a Latin one should be prefixed; just not Binderic, lest they be like those he wrote in Vadianus's Aphorisms. If no one is willing to undertake this task, it would not be inconvenient, nor unhelpful for new grace and concord, if you yourself would recommend it with a small preface.</p>
      <p>If it seems useful, he could add a description of the three monsters. I would have prefixed a poem to this, but the author, not yet recommended by himself, cannot recommend others.</p>
      <p>Lord Eobanus, whose portrait I send you here, is lying gravely ill. I fear he may not recover; he is oppressed by both age and illness. He had begun the work of the "Fasti," of which he showed me the beginning. We must certainly pray to God that his most praiseworthy work is not hindered by his death. I also send his poem "De casu Moguntiaco," which he entrusted to me alone to transcribe. I promised in good faith that I would not give it to any printer; therefore, please ensure that it does not fall into anyone's hands. It will be published by the author himself when all his works are printed together.</p>
      <p>The fair is quite meager, and I see hardly any books here worth viewing. I could not find any epitome of physics, nor any astronomical works.</p>
      <p>Crato had printed Cellarius's work on the sphere in octavo, but he sold all the copies. I wanted to send you a booklet on the sphere and the theories of the planets, but I could not find these either. However, I send Philippus's "De anima," a booklet of riddles described by a young man perhaps nineteen years old. There is nothing else here but some books, which, I believe, were born to impose their trifles on the common eyes of all. Sarcerius always patches up something new. I do not know what has emerged "from the magnificent Swiss city of Bern"; I am truly amazed if God will tolerate such arrogance any longer.</p>
      <p>The Landgrave, as I hear, still persists in his intention. Froschauer took care of Dionysius's letters. He read them, as Froschauer said, not without sorrow.</p>
      <p>But however much he denies it, I certainly know him to be both the author and defender of this. He has another companion, a preacher from Melsungen. But what would Dionysius not dare in the disturbance of marriage, when he already has three living wives, two of whom were left by him and repudiated without any right?</p>
      <p>Martin Beyer from Schaffhausen, just returned from Wittenberg, reports that Luther is compelled to write against polygamy by this example of the prince. Philippus has fallen seriously ill because of this matter. The Duke of Lüneburg has complained about this with great weeping and lamentation. The rumor had reached Marburg that she was abducted by force from his palace, but a courtier reported to me that she still remains in her former honor, for he affirmed that he had seen her within three days.</p>
      <p>A theologian was summoned by the Landgrave to subscribe to this marriage, and when he refused, the prince could hardly restrain his hands from him, moved by anger and lustful fury, rebuking the theologian with these words: "May the devil torment you; there are people who have signed who have forgotten more than you will learn in your lifetime." The theologian replied: "I confess, my lord, my ignorance; however, I do not wish to burden my conscience with this consent, neither for your favor nor for theirs." It is also certain that two or three times now, noblemen have plotted against this second wife to intercept her returning from the prince. She, however, raises her crest quite proudly, sometimes threatening the true wife. Yet I can hardly believe she will remain so for much longer.</p>
      <p>These are the exercises of Christian princes! Duke Heinrich of Brunswick is engaged in daily skirmishes with the city of Brunswick. The maritime cities, namely Lübeck with its confederates, will join the Brunswickers.</p>
      <p>A certain nobleman, Balthasar from Frisia, practicing piracy, with one prize took more than four tons of gold from the maritime cities. The fortresses of that nobleman, Witmund and Oeselz, are now besieged by those cities.</p>
      <p>I have nothing certain to write about the King of Denmark. The Emperor is still in Ghent; I will consider Germany fortunate only when it is freed from the presence of this emperor. The French king is up to something, I do not know what. It is uncertain what the Emperor of the Turks is doing.</p>
      <p>In England, everything is being tossed up and down in such confusion and storms of misfortune that you would believe this king has sworn to the very laws of lust, cruelty, inconstancy, and impiety. He has repudiated the newly married queen, the sister of the Duke of Cleves, and married another Englishwoman whom he had previously impregnated. Lord Thomas Cromwell, the Primate of England, a man most devoted to piety and good letters, his most ready friend and protector, was executed within a month without a cause being stated. He burned Doctor Barnes with two leading ministers of the gospel, tied to one stake and one column. Then he beheaded three other defenders of the papist religion. Who, therefore, would trust such a Proteus, about whom it is uncertain what to decide? All books are either burned or removed from the kingdom. No merchant comes from England except Richard Hilles, who told me all these things as certain and undoubted.</p>
      <p>Our Nicholas intended to come; what has hindered his journey is uncertain. The example of another Englishman fills me with fear, who, having escaped from the kingdom, was caught in Antwerp and brought back to England for execution. It is finally forbidden for anyone to leave England for the sake of letters to Germany. Anyone wishing to leave needs the king's testimony, and yet no other route is open than to Leuven and Paris.</p>
      <p>These are indeed inauspicious news. We could complain about many things if we did not know that the Lord's judgment is just. I believe this is the punishment for our ingratitude.</p>
      <p>Greet my mother and wife with all the family in my words. Farewell, most kind father.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt, September 15, 1540.</p>
      <p>Yours most observantly,</p>
      <p>Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
