      <p>S. P. D. I have spoken, dearest brother, on your behalf in recent days with the most pious Mr. Budaeus, and I have read in his booklet what you were kind enough to write: finally, I received your most gracious letters, for which I thank you and am grateful, both because you have responded to the question as much as is sufficient, and because you have made me a participant in the new matters. As for the former, I believe that, just as to me, so also to your humanity, Budaeus has said that a book will soon be published which will contain abundantly the reasons for the actions against that heresiarch. Indeed, in my judgment, it is almost necessary: I perceive such a great diversity of opinions and sentiments, even diametrically opposed, among those who are considered learned. A certain most learned and equally pious friend of ours (who indeed does not wish to be named) will write against the book on the errors of the Trinity. Then, once the matter is completed, everyone will know the author, unless something else prevents it. If he also had other works of Servetus, I think he would do the same against them. Although I think nothing of these matters is hidden from you, I write nevertheless what I have heard, that the son of the Emperor will soon be the husband of the Queen of England. May the best Lord and Father keep you safe for a very long time. I commend myself to your prayers. From Basel, December 19, 1553.</p>
      <p>In haste.</p>
      <p>Yours in every way, Guglielmo Grataroli, physician.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and best pastor of the church of Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed brother and superior. To Zürich.</p>
