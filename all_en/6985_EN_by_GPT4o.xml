      <p>Greetings. Safe and sound, most esteemed man, I came to Chur and staying with Mr. Gantner, I was not received so prosperously; for I do not know what horror had seized me and had made me completely glassy.</p>
      <p>I thought no differently than that I too had been seized by the plague, nor were there lacking certain signs and beginnings of this evil for me. But three days later, when I had induced a sweat, everything subsided most happily, so that by the grace of God I now feel I am in the best of health. I handed over the letters of recommendation to Mr. Consul, for which I give you eternal thanks; for the weight they carried was abundantly declared by the goodwill and honor of the whole city, with which they daily shower me, unworthy and unwilling as I am. Indeed, the new consul, who now holds the consulship, is the very embodiment of courtesy. Now, six times since I left Reichenau, I have preached here, by the immortal gods, how unhappily, how unwillingly. I am not, my father, certainly not sufficient for such a task, especially in such a spacious and resonant church, where I cannot even moderate my voice, let alone pronounce anything worthy enough. Certainly, by pushing me there against the testimony of both your and my conscience, you have promoted me. Change, I beg you, your opinion, or I will have to find another way to take care of myself. You have others abundant in learning and knowledge, who will perform this duty far more suitably than I, who am not even moderately versed in any branch of knowledge. I speak seriously, and the torture of my conscience will eventually destroy me. I was to leave today; but the most esteemed senate had already earnestly asked me to stay until the end of the assembly; for it was fitting and necessary. I, as I should, obeyed, but with the loss of my family's resources; for I fear that my wife and children may perish from hunger. Yesterday, Mr. Pontisella and we were most liberally treated by the most esteemed senate (who celebrated the beginning of the new year, which may be most fortunate for you, with certain cakes), then proceeding to the priestly house, which I had not entered before. Immediately, the words of Cicero came to mind: "O house, how unequal a master you serve!" and there is not a corner that I did not sprinkle with my tears, especially in the Fabrician study. Leaving, we proceeded through certain byways to the house of Mr. Gantner, which is near the gates. Behold, indeed, expecting nothing of the sort, but about to enter the house, the entrance of the bishop came into view. We did not know it was the bishop's entourage; for he was not expected on this day, so we looked upon his arrival with covered heads. But by the immortal gods, who would have expected such a display from the bishop!</p>
      <p>For the noise was no louder than if a funeral were proceeding; he was accompanied by few horsemen, his arrival was at nightfall, there was no sound of trumpets, no sound of cannons; no one from the senatorial order came out to meet him. Only some butchers, men of no account, were found, who pretended to be obliging for the sake of fattening. The shout "baruch" was missing, and thus with no splendor, in the most negligent pomp, indeed for fear of the opposing power, he took possession of the empire. But if only he would govern with the same negligence with which he began his reign, and end it immediately! His anathemas will not be much to fear; but even if he were to raise his crests, we would safely scorn his empty bombast.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my most humane father, and hold me in the highest regard. Quickly this; for I am waiting for Mr. Gantner and Mr. Consul. Mr. Pontisella and Mr. Gantner and the consul send you their most dutiful greetings.</p>
      <p>Your Excellency's most submissive Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>Chur, 2nd day of the new year.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most renowned minister of the Church of Zürich, his most eternally revered patron. In Zürich.</p>
