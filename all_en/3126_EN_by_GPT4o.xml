      <p>Greetings. It does not escape me, most humane man and most vigilant overseer of the church of God, that it is pleasing to you, due to your piety, to know the state of our churches. Therefore, receive the whole matter in a few words. By divine benefit, the tranquility of our churches still stands amidst enemies, which not so much the Papists as the defenders of the carnal presence of the body of Christ try much more to disturb, a kind of people most stubborn in this part of their doctrine, which cannot be bent or led to any moderation by any arguments, however effective and clear. But so far, against our churches, even if they have tried this in various ways under the pretext of the Augsburg Confession and consensus with the neighboring Saxon cities, they have been able to promote nothing, thanks be to the Lord, but our churches daily take greater increases.</p>
      <p>And in the church of Bremen, there was a serious conflict throughout this winter because of the sacramental matter. For the pastors pressed the ubiquity of the body of Christ, which Doctor Albert opposed.</p>
      <p>The matter, exacerbated by the clamor of the pastors, almost turned into a sedition. Finally, the controversy was referred to the Wittenbergers.</p>
      <p>There, Philipp tempered the opinion in such a way that Doctor Albert does not complain about it. The adversaries strive to have him expelled from the city of Bremen. But so far in vain. If the Lord would deign to open some window there, greater tranquility of the churches and pious consensus could be hoped for. It might not be useless if Doctor Albert were confirmed and encouraged by your letters. But I leave this to your judgment.</p>
      <p>The chief vociferator among the Bremen pastors, namely that author of the farrago, Johannes Timmann, has passed away. Now greater tranquility of that church is to be hoped for.</p>
      <p>We in this country hope for peace from our neighbor, the Count of Essen, who last summer sought many occasions of war with us, and unless our prince had borne his injuries and provocations with remarkable long-suffering, we would already be involved in wars. However, the Count of Essen, after truces were made with us in October until the next April, went to his castle in Reideburg, located at the borders of Westphalia, where he is besieged by the Count of Lippe at the end of November, because, among other things, he had plundered and burned the house of a certain nobleman on that journey; this siege still lasts. A day has now been set at Dortmund, not far from the city of Münster, to settle the matter by judgment, where also the controversy of our prince with the Count of Essen will be decided by judgment, and therefore we are raised to a good hope of peace.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Polish journey of Lord Johannes a Lasco, if you are perhaps unaware of it from the letters of Lord Johannes Utenhove, which he wrote to me from Wrocław, I will explain it to your kindness. He writes thus: We were received at Wittenberg more kindly than expected.</p>
      <p>Lord Philipp invited the lord to a certain public ordination of ministers and an academic banquet, and that in the name of the university itself. But then we lingered there for three days, nor was it right for the lord to linger longer. From there it is also easy to see that the principal men of that academy are not alien to our doctrine: rather, it is most certain that they are all ours, this also being attested by Philipp himself, who, when he had led the lord to his lecture, made honorable mention of him in his lecture, saying that his lecture must then be contracted for his sake, so that freer faculty of conversation might be given among them. He also had previously mentioned the lord honorably in his lectures, as well as Lord Calvin. He also publicly depicts Westphal and testifies that he gives cause for disturbances to the churches in these most calamitous times. Here at Wrocław, the lord was honored with honorary wine, both by private friends and also by the city itself. Furthermore, in Poland, free assemblies of the kingdom had long been proclaimed, but by the cunning of Aloisius of Verona, the papal legate, other assemblies were proclaimed, from which the nobles of the kingdom and their envoys (as they call them) were excluded, so that he, with the bishops and a few men of that kind, might decide, especially in religion, what they wanted. Meanwhile, the nobles, even if this was unheard of, did not want to disturb those assemblies which had already begun to be held.</p>
      <p>But all had so firmly resolved, even those who were still Papists, that they would hold nothing valid of what was done and transacted there. By the intervention of the royal senate and its counsel and authority, those assemblies cunningly concocted by Aloisius vanished, and public assemblies were proclaimed at Wrocław on the first of December, free and according to the custom of the country, where, when Aloisius came with the bishops, he was ordered to leave Warsaw within three days. Thus far Utenhove.</p>
      <p>From other letters, I have understood that Lord a Lasco came safe and sound to Poland on the third of December, to the great joy of all his people. The Lord must be asked to open seats for his church in that kingdom for the salvation of many souls and the promotion of the kingdom of Christ. Amen. Farewell, most excellent man, and do not hesitate to greet my most respected teachers, Lord Peter Martyr, Lord Bibliander, and Lord Gesner, in my name. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Norden, Frisia, March 8, 1557.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your piety, Martin Micronius.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the church of Zürich, his lord and brother, most to be observed. Zürich.</p>
