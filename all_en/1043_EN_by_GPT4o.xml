      <p>Greetings in the Lord, most learned Heinrich, I received your letter on October 3rd and thank you for the news. I am also surprised that I have not received any letters from Leipzig; perhaps they will send them from the Leipzig fair to Nuremberg and from Nuremberg to our fair. Although it is easy to infer from the books what the state of the church is in Saxony; for, as it seems to me, Saxony is divided into three parts: there are pure evangelicals, there are adiaphorists, there are papists, and also... to that part, there are Interimists. Thus the Lord tests us in various ways and sects before His final day. If you wish to buy any books that are available from Magdeburg, you can do so in time; Wittenberg has given almost nothing, and it is strange why this is so. I wrote and I think you received the letters about the King of Tunis, who is said to have died from a wound, and about other matters that I received from a certain doctor who was recently in Augsburg. Duke Christoph of WÃ¼rttemberg approaches his father; he undoubtedly institutes something new, or Duke Ulrich is ill. He would leave the ministry of the gospel or institute something else.</p>
      <p>I am also surprised why Gwalther, your relative, refused to translate Oecolampadius into Latin, when he promised it more than once and when I have a printer who offered to print all our teacher's works, when/which he could have easily done and with no effort, as he is practiced in Zwinglian works and has those expressions at hand with which to render obscure things. I hear that Luther's works on the sacrament are already being prepared for the press, and shall we cease and be ungrateful to our teachers? Write to our Myconius, from whom he derived the doctrine spread about Pelagianism. I will take care of your letters properly; for I will give them to a merchant or send them from our fair to Leipzig most conveniently to Mr. Paceus, who will then ensure they are delivered to Wittenberg. Farewell. Basel, October 4, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius from the heart.</p>
      <p>Our Oporinus sends you these two booklets. I would have sent Mr. Gerbel's book if he could have conveniently carried it. Heinrich Petri will give you these curated ones at a modest price, as the bookseller does, or, if you like, I will list the authors contained in that book; for I know you have most of them. It contains the letters of Ignatius and some of Philo's works by Crematius Albinus, etc. Perhaps you already have all these authors. Farewell again. Greet Gwalther and Frisius in my name, whom we are expecting.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned lord, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my gracious lord, to his hands.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
