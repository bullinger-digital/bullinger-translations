      <p>Greetings. From the letters I recently wrote to my brother, I believe you have already understood how my affairs are and why I have not written to you for several weeks. The unusual cold has given occasion to my illness, causing me to be confined to bed again, where I still remain until the Lord frees me, which I hope will happen soon; may He, in the meantime, grant patience and strength of spirit! I was also surprised that nothing came from you in the meantime, especially since I had requested the return of Carpenter's writing (because I did not have my own copy). But finally, the day before yesterday, I received your letters sent through Locher's son, which have largely satisfied me. As for that boy, it will be difficult for him to obtain anything here; however, he has some ministers among us who are somewhat related to him, who will support him at their own expense for a while, until he gains some reputation or esteem through diligence. I took care of Hottoman's letters and know to whom I handed them over, and there will be no danger in them.</p>
      <p>Carpenter's writing has not yet been seen by Beza; for he assures us of this.</p>
      <p>We therefore sent him a printed copy these days. I advised my brother to return the written copy to me, as it does not belong to me.</p>
      <p>As far as I know, nothing special is happening here. My brother wrote to me about certain rumors circulating among you about the king being fatally wounded in a certain hunt, etc. But none of this is reported among us. During the recent freeze, Lake Geneva near the city was covered with ice, so that they seemed to be in great danger; for if any hostile army had been nearby, the city could easily have been captured from this side. Therefore, they soon sought assistance from us. This was granted to them, but under certain conditions. However, while these were being discussed, the Lord melted the ice and freed them from this fear and the need for protection at the same time.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I know nothing new. My lord mayor Steiger sends you many greetings and wishes you many happy years and requests hereby to understand from you what you have done with his two barrels of wine that belong to Glarus; you should let me know, so he can settle it again.</p>
      <p>Do not fail to inform me of this; for he has instructed me very earnestly. I hear that much has been drawn from your side; this displeases the lord; the fault is that one has not always been able to run. Meanwhile, others also send greetings, MÃ¼linensis, Diesbachius, both treasurers, one of whom, Gravenrietus, recently betrothed his daughter to David Wunderlich, the other, Manuel, is preparing a splendid wedding for his daughter on the next Monday, whom he has given to a young man from the Diesbach family.</p>
      <p>Yesterday we received friendly letters from the University of Wittenberg, in which they also recommend to us a certain local student. You will learn the rest from my brother's letters.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I pray to the Lord that this year, along with many others, is prosperous for you and all yours. Amen.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 16, 1573, as I am about to complete the fiftieth year of my life in two days by the grace of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
