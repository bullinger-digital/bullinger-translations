      <p>S. Thirdly, after we departed from you, we returned here safely and unharmed by the grace of the Lord; we truly give you and all of you the greatest and immense thanks for the kindness, services, and benefits rendered to us, which we wish we could someday repay equally! When we returned here, Beza met with Gentile; for in his favor, he stayed here for an entire day, but to no avail. He is indeed a most stubborn rascal and very talkative, who, although he is convicted and constrained by clear testimonies of scripture and other reasons, still does not want to acknowledge that he has erred, but seeks a starting point. From that time, we have dealt with him many times, but in vain. He has been detained here for an entire month now. He has been caught in obvious lies, of which he is not ashamed. The prefect of Gaiennsis was summoned because of him, to whom he dedicated his confession. He is now here; I hope, therefore, that we will soon be freed from this plague. You already know that the Anabaptist was beheaded. He died in such obstinacy that he did not want prayers to be made for him or to join his prayers with those of the bystanders; he ordered them to pray if they wished, saying he did not need their prayers, as he could pray for himself. I predict that Gentile will also meet the same end.</p>
      <p>A few days after we returned, Sultzer sent his own messenger here with many letters and news, from which I copied the main points onto this paper, which I am sending to you here. I suspect he heard something about our meeting and wanted to elicit what is being done in this way; I cannot know what response he received from each one. We told no one anything except the senate, to whom everything that was done had to be reported. Whatever it may be, let him wonder, plot, undermine, whatever he wants, the truth will prevail, and he will perish with his tricks. We are surprised that nothing has been brought from you yet or that your messenger has been absent for so long. We do not doubt your faith, that you will soon inform us of how everything stands once he has returned.</p>
      <p>Beza writes back to me from his journey in these words: "I want you to know for certain, as surely as if we had seen it with our own eyes, that the Turk Suleiman is present with eight hundred thousand, as he was only a station's distance away from Belgrade on the 14th of the previous month (that is, July), and so incensed that, unless death intervenes, he has openly sworn that he will never return to Constantinople except as a victor. A fleet of 140 sails is sailing in the Adriatic, prepared not so much for attacks as for incursions. Lazarus has captured a small castle in Hungary and has caused great fear to the Pasha of Buda, whom Suleiman soon ordered to be impaled. The King of Algiers has severely damaged the Spanish fleet. I hold these things as certain, especially those concerning Hungary, from an eyewitness." He adds these things, to which he immediately adds: "I now add something else, which I want you to understand as most certain from the same source, that you may inform the lord consul, that the Duke of Savoy recently attempted everything in Venice under the pretext of negotiating about the kingdom of Cyprus, to draw the Venetians into an alliance against us specifically and privately to recover his dominions, but by the grace of God, he achieved nothing," etc. From that time, it has also been written to Mr. Steiger from France that the Spaniard has obtained from the Queen of France a passage with an army into Lower Germany to suppress his subjects who are rioting because of religion; meanwhile, after the king learned that the nobility in the Netherlands is not rioting because of religion nor seeking religion, but only cannot bear the inquisition, he has abolished it and is now sending those prepared forces to Liguria, to which the Duke of Savoy will also join his own, and there is a danger that they may turn against us. These are from there. But if the Turk threatens Italy in this way, the Spaniards and the Duke of Savoy will have something else to do elsewhere. However, the Lord must be prayed to, that he may avert these storms from us and preserve his churches from evil. These are the news I have now; I expect to learn more from you soon. Farewell. All of ours diligently greet you, Mr. Consul Steiger, Diesbach, MÃ¼linensis, both treasurers, Amadiensis, etc., as well as my father-in-law, wife, and mother. Give my regards and express my greatest thanks to all of yours, especially to Mr. Zwingli, whom, I do not know by what fate, I was not allowed to address.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 20, 1566.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>Mrs. Christiana zum Bach, the widow of the late Marquart Zehender, and the late Hans and the late Samuel, my brother-in-law, also Marquart the current one, also my brother-in-law, mother, informed me how her son, who remained in Vienna, Austria, has done so much good while he was with you in Zurich. Therefore, she would like to show you her gratitude with some gift, and if she had known that I would ride out, she would have arranged it through me. Since I have many messages for you, I should also send you these 4 crowns on her behalf, so that, since she hears that you still have two daughters with you, you may give each of them two of these for a trinket and as a sign of her friendship, love, and gratitude, and that you may also pray to God for her, that he may grant her to complete the course of her life happily and to depart in true faith to the blessed community of the elect. Please receive and understand this on my behalf in the best way. Besides, she does not want this gift to be mentioned to anyone among her own. I had written these the day before yesterday, intending to send them through that Diethelm, the glassmaker, who recently brought Zehender's insignia painted on glass; but he has not returned to me, so I do not know whether he has left or not or where he is. Meanwhile, yesterday at nightfall, your messenger came here bringing yours to us. The consul sent to me this morning, before the senate was held, what your senate wrote; the senate will hear it today, and I have no doubt that they will all be of the same opinion as yours. I am concerned that the Turk will send troops towards Erfurt. Besides the other things I noted above, I now have nothing else.</p>
      <p>I am sorry to hear that you are not in good health. I also almost perished from dysentery last night and am not yet well. I pray to the Lord to keep you for a long time. All of ours greet you again. August 22, 1566.</p>
      <p>I am returning Fabritius's letters. I will write everything diligently to Beza. To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, my most esteemed and revered lord and compatriot.</p>
