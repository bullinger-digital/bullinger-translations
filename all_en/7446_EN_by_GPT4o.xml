      <p> Greetings. I also write a few things in return. What I have regarding peace, I send to my brother; he will communicate it to you. One thing I forgot to mention is that the people of Geneva have no hope that the Duke of Savoy will accept the peace that was established and made recently at the Neuchâtel assembly, in which your consul also participated; for he burdens them with new exactions anew. For this reason, they have sent a delegation here these days, and our people are writing to the Duke on their behalf. Many think, "it will go on as before: life will have no end until one must again take up the banner." I have nothing from Beza yet; when I receive something, I will share it with you. The rest is contained in my brother's letters. </p>
      <p> Our new consul, Mr. von Mülinen, greets you, as does the old Mr. Steiger, who, although he can walk, still stays at home because he does not yet dare to commit himself to a journey without a cane or support. Blasius, my son-in-law, who is now here with me, also greets you, as do my father-in-law, Diesbach, and Gravenriet with Manuel. </p>
      <p> Bern, April 22, 1568. </p>
      <p> I return those things that were sent to you from Augsburg, and I thank you for them. Johannes Jacob Bonstetter, the governor of Neuchâtel, also sends you his singular greetings. </p>
      <p> Your Johannes Haller. </p>
