      <p>Greetings. Returning to you, dearest compater in the Lord, is our beloved brother Johannes Traber. He would not have been a burden to me if he had stayed; however, since he believes it might be quicker to find a calling either among the Rhaetians, the Glarus people, or the Appenzell people if he goes to you rather than staying here, he has decided, with your help and goodwill, to remain with you for a while until some arrangement is made for him. He is truly sincere and free from all deceit, sound in doctrine, and innocent in life. I beseech you to assist him as much as you can; he has nothing; what he received from the people of Augsburg, he left to his wife and daughter and set out content with a modest provision, hoping that he will not be abandoned by the providence of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I am sending here the division of the Decalogue, which we use in the churches of Christ, confirmed by the testimonies of the fathers, with the intention of countering those scoundrels and impostors who now in Augsburg remove the second commandment concerning the avoidance of images from the catechisms, which not only the Papists and Interimists do, but also the Lutherans, in order to gradually reintroduce the use of images into the evangelical churches. I pray, if you can in any way, send these through the people of St. Gallen to Augsburg or to the people of Memmingen or Kempten, etc. There is great silence about the Council of Trent. The Emperor is still staying in Augsburg, and it is not known when he will depart, which I heard from a certain courier from Augsburg the day before yesterday, who reported that six hundred horsemen are expected in Augsburg, whom the Emperor will use either to depart for Italy or Lower Germany. Farewell very well, dearest compater. I wish all prosperity for the wedding of your Elisabeth. May the Lord keep you and yours safe for a long time. All of mine send greetings to you and your household.</p>
      <p>Bern, 8th of October, 1551.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, your compater in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest compater in the Lord.</p>
