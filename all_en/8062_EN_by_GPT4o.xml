      <p>Greetings through our Lord Jesus Christ, amen. Venerable and especially gracious Lord Bullinger, your two letters, dated September 30 and October 11, reached me on the 23rd of this month, along with the gifts you kindly sent to my young daughter. For this, my wife and I thank you very earnestly on her behalf. According to your command, it shall be hung around her neck so that, when she comes to understanding, she may find comfort in such glorious promises. May the merciful God grant her the grace of His Holy Spirit, so that she may become a child of eternal life. Now, I will reciprocate such and other kindnesses towards you.</p>
      <p>As for the letters, I have sent them through Mr. Gutetter to Krakow, and they will surely be answered; if anything comes of it, it shall be sent to you at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>Our Illyrian preachers are now somewhat quiet, thank God, for our lords have always deposed one from the pulpit or preaching chair, but not the others so much. May God make them aware of their misdeeds, for they truly sharpen the wounds of the poor Christians in France and the Netherlands not a little, and it is truly to be pitied that our princes and lords do not open their eyes and see that when things go badly for the poor people, such evil will befall them. But the aforementioned preachers are a great cause of this, for the common man says of them that they would rather be Anabaptist than Zwinglian and Calvinist. Through such means of Satan, the course of the holy gospel is hindered, and it is to be feared that if the Lord does not have mercy on us, it might come to an end. These are the fruits of their faith, for they want to be highly regarded and make themselves a following among the common people through their slander and reviling.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have learned from your letter how the legate in Solothurn claims that the admiral has withdrawn from Poitiers, whereas it is written from Bern that he still lies before it. In short, I am sadly concerned that the good news does not want to follow, for we have letters from Lyon and Antwerp here; it is reported that after the king's brother besieged and bombarded Châtellerault, he lost an assault there, in which many Italians and notable people perished. When the admiral noticed the severe siege, he left Poitiers and drove the enemy away from Châtellerault, who retreated behind him to Chinon. But on October 3, it is said that a battle took place in which the king gained victory, the admiral's forces were completely destroyed, he himself dead, some say captured, Count Volrad of Mansfeld also dead; in short, everything is said to be lost, with 14,000 slain.</p>
      <p>On the king's side, however, over 200 men are said to have remained, among them Margrave Philibert of Baden, Count Peter Ernst of Mansfeld, whom the Duke of Alba sent to assist the king.</p>
      <p>Such news truly makes me very sad, although I do not give credence to everything. It is indeed a great wonder that no certain news is to be had from the admiral's camp, for many citizens went with Duke Wolfgang, but since they entered, no news has been heard from them. I had thought that in Geneva one should have certain news. Much is said, but it is all lies, therefore I ask, if you have anything certain, especially regarding what happened with Poitiers and likewise with the battle, to share the same with me at the first opportunity; in doing so, you would do me a special favor.</p>
      <p>Nothing else at this time, except that my wife and I send our very earnest greetings to you and your daughters, along with your entire household and all lords and good friends, and commend you to the protection and care of the Most High.</p>
      <p>Given in Nuremberg on October 28, 1569. Your willing servant, Gabriel Schlüsselberger.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and highly learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the elder, my especially gracious lord, in Zurich.</p>
