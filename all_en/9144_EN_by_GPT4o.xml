      <p>May the almighty God grant you, Susanne, and the children many thousands of good years; this is what I and all my people wish for you from God with all our hearts. May God make our wish powerful. Beloved son, yesterday I wrote you a small note just before the sermon, as I had no time otherwise. Now I have a little more time; thank you again for the good year and all the good things. Regarding the day in Baden, know (but keep it to yourself and make little of it) that the 7 places have made a sharp move against the 4 cities, as they endure very badly that they are so poorly trusted; they have already done something in France, yet they are not of that mind, as some say, if one wanted to tire them out, they would be ready in time, just as if they had something shameful in mind. So they have met in Aarau, mustered, set up watches, as if enemies were present, acted, etc. To which the cities replied: these are strange events, much distrust against a confederation, therefore they do not consider it unreasonable. They also have the custom to inspect armor and weapons; they meet continuously in Lucerne. Why then should they not also meet?</p>
      <p>Watches have been set up because of unruly people on both sides, so that nothing unfriendly begins, etc. After this explanation, which still happened with many more words, the 7 places further held against the cities: they, the cities, should trust them as honest confederates, who want to hold faithfully to them, peace and land peace, and show them no unfaithfulness, and as the cities have accepted the Council of Trent, in which they have agreed and that one understands to execute, etc. answer: they have agreed to the council for the sake of faith and doctrine, but have not promised to help maintain or execute it, and if their envoys have agreed to anything there, they have no recommendation, etc. they want to keep honest peace and land peace, etc. To which the cities decided that they are also of the same mind towards them and also want to commit life, goods, and blood to them as honest confederates, etc. In summary: a trusted person has told me in secret that he has been sent to the confederate meetings for many years; but never has he seen them so inclined towards each other and openly said to each other what it was about, that at first it seemed quite dangerous. On the other hand, when they have well discussed and spared nothing, the matter has become so friendly and good on both sides, that he has never seen them become more friendly and kind towards each other, and they have parted in the highest love and friendship. They have also talked about the alliance oath, and if that happens, that even the foreigners see that they are one, and know that they do not need to hope or rejoice in our discord. It has also been discussed that each place should swear according to its faith, and this has been included in the decision, but no other day has been set, but whichever place has something urgent, may ask my gracious lords of Zurich to call a meeting. It has also been dealt with about the coin and salt, of which I do not yet know the basis; for I have not inquired about it as I have about the aforementioned main matter, and also hear that the matter of Paradise is not much thought of. So the Frenchman has come forward; for the king has sent Lord Bellievre to excuse the king for his murder; he has laid down a long speech, in which he blames everything on the late admiral and his people...</p>
