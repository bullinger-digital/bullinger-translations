      <p>Greetings. I give you thanks, which I would rather, if I could, return, because through your efforts our son Alexander received a stipend in Basel and because you have always treated my children so kindly as they passed through there; may the Lord, the rewarder of all good, repay you. I am returning the letters from Poland in good faith here, as you see; we all read them, we give thanks to God, who continues to expand the kingdom of his Son and to add brothers to us.</p>
      <p>That the Lutherans, whom they call Zwinglians, hate us and pursue us with insults is nothing new; for I have experienced here how much they abhor us. Father Komander hopes for better from this and jokingly said with me that it is customary for evil demons, when they are forced to leave people, to torment them more bitterly. Thus, he predicts from these disturbances that it is near for those carnivores to succumb. We have no news that can be written with certainty. On Sunday, there will be a meeting here because of the controversy between our captain and the vicar in the Valtellina. Consul Ambrosius Martinus today ordered us to greet you; our praetor Johannes Tscherner, Pontisella, and especially Komander send their regards. From Chur, on the 29th of July, in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours in all humanity, Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and benefactor in all good things.</p>
