      <p>S. D. May it be happy and fortunate! First, from illness, indeed still in the remnants of illness, I write to you, my dearest brother; for although I have not yet fully freed myself from bed, but struggle doubtfully with the remnants of very serious illnesses, I could not refrain from writing any longer. You will kindly consider these brief words and commend me to the Lord in your prayers; for the anthrax, which I contracted from the plague, is not yet fully cured, nor has that pestilential swelling, which erupted in my right leg not far from the groin, completely subsided; but also the pains in my right side and head often recur and return. My strength was exhausted before the Lord subjected me to this discipline; now I am completely weakened and deprived of strength; I am indeed beginning to walk, but with a faltering step. Today marks the end of the 8th week of my illness; therefore, I await the Lord, to whom I have wholly given myself, that He may restore me and return me to my ministry when it seems good to Him; I implore His mercy. You know that the Lord in my old age (for I am now in my 61st year) has taken from me the staff of my old age, my dearest wife, a most excellent and pious woman, etc. But the Lord is just and His judgments are just.</p>
      <p>In recent days, He also took away my beloved daughter, the wife of Mr. Lavater, from whom I had hoped for much comfort; she left behind 7 orphans. But the Lord is good and His will is good, without which these things have not happened; may He continue to do what is good in His eyes, provided He does not take away His mercy from me and mine! Otherwise, the plague continues to carry off many.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of this month, I received letters from our mutual friend and most faithful servant of God, Mr. Beza; I send them along with the pages of the sent booklet, but so that you may read them promptly and return them safely, lest anything be lost.</p>
      <p>I remember you once asked me what I think about renewing the French alliance, etc. Since this matter is now being discussed and much is being said about it, I share with you what I wrote before my illness, indeed before half a year ago, and communicated to all our leaders, and I ask you to return it with others.</p>
      <p>With the Glarus affair, it has come to the point that those from Schwyz are supposed to let the governor of the Glarus ride up and that they sit at the days with the Glarus.</p>
      <p>However, since the people of Schwyz have some repetitions, I cannot know how the Glarus understand it, etc.; it still lies in the balance, etc. Our messenger has returned home this week from Lausanne: there peace has been concluded and documented between Savoy and Bern; France and Spain will also seal it.</p>
      <p>With Geneva, the duke desires to be reinstated in his rights as from ancient times, and that the alliance with Bern be dissolved; the Bernese oppose this, unless they are forced by right.</p>
      <p>The Genevans do not willingly give back the rights; the duke says he otherwise does not care about their religion or freedom, etc.</p>
      <p>The Sunday before St. Thomas is now seen here as another day. I cannot say more.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently with all yours; mine greet you. Greet the magistrates, Pastor Lindower, and Forer, the fellow minister, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, on the eve of St. Martin, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Now our Mangold offers you his greetings, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, lord, friend, and most esteemed and dearest brother. Winterthur.</p>
