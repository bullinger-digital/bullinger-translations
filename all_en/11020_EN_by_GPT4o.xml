    <p xml:id="regest1">Provide the following testimony for Heinrich Dürst, who is intended for the newly created deaconate in Gossau (Canton of Zurich), to the examiners: Dürst, who has been working as a chaplain in Wetzikon for 12-14 years, has been inclined towards the evangelical doctrine from the beginning and has always willingly and satisfactorily assisted in the preaching service; Dürst is sufficiently qualified - he once had Myconius as a teacher - to take on such a task. After his dissolute life was severely criticized in the synod [of October 19, 1535], he did improve, but must continue to be admonished regarding his conduct and official duties; the chapter has good hope for him.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, etc.</p>
      <p>To the pious, dear, and faithful fathers in the Lord. Brother Heinrich Dürst from Gossau (the bearer of this letter) visited us today, Tuesday, March 27, in a general meeting, indicating how he was primarily called to the newly established deaconate in Gossau by Zurich and presented to you (as the examiners). However, since you did not examine him, but first wanted to ascertain how long he had lived and preached with us in the Grüningen district, and how he had conducted himself in the proclamation of the word, also with a friendly request to provide you with such information, etc. In response, we have diligently and thoroughly deliberated among ourselves and found that the aforementioned brother Heinrich has been a chaplain in Wetzikon for 12 or 14 years, has acknowledged the evangelical truth from the beginning, and has willingly preached and served in his church whenever required. Some of us have also heard him and found him, in our judgment, not incapable but rather quite sufficient to proclaim or present Christ simply. In particular, no evil nature has been detected in him. For he received his principles from Myconius, which he has not yet entirely abandoned. In our discussions, we can deduce a nature that could still be useful, especially if he were given the opportunity through proper support. Therefore, we earnestly and kindly ask your love to recommend the good, poor brother, etc.</p>
      <p>However, since the aforementioned brother Heinrich was once found guilty of some misconduct before the synod and a definite judgment followed, namely that he should not come with such transgressions anymore, etc. He has shown visible improvement, although he still needs admonishment, which we hereby partly entrust to you, namely that he earnestly studies, moderates his drinking and excessive socializing with the peasants in taverns, manages his household well, cares for his children, and diligently attends our meetings, etc., which he has indeed committed to us earnestly. Therefore, we ask for him as long as he fulfills his promise; if not, our lords have their hand open to reinstate him. Yet we have all good hope for him, as we have arranged good supervision of his household and all deficiencies, which may help him well. Otherwise, he is a good, pious, and faithful man, whom we commend to you and all of us in general, and we are commended to the Lord God.</p>
      <p>Given in Bubikon, Tuesday, March 27, in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>To the pious, etc. M. Leo Jud and Heinrich Bullinger, servants of the church in Zurich, our dear fathers in the Lord.</p>
      <p>For the advancement of Heinrich Dürst.</p>
