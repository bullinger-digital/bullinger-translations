      <p>Greetings in the Lord. News.</p>
      <p>The people of Magdeburg have come out with three companies of soldiers to gather provisions; in one place they had to retreat because the people there ran inside, and they suffered some losses. Later, they came back more forcefully, stormed the small town, captured it, plundered it, and set it on fire. They also plundered two other small towns and many villages along a stretch of 13 miles. Thus, they are seeking their enemy, Margrave Joachim the Elector, at home. It is time for them to expand their reach, as they have no more access to provisions. It is said they have driven away more than 30,000 heads of cattle, hay, grain, beer, and whatever else they found, taking everything into the city.</p>
      <p>They have minted a new coin; on one side is a beautifully engraved depiction of the Baptism of Christ, with the inscription: "Hic est filius meus dilectus" (This is my beloved son); on the other side, they have depicted the Temptation of Christ, with Satan wearing a triple papal crown, and the inscription: "Pack dich Satan, du sch채ndliches Interim" (Begone, Satan, you shameful Interim). The Lord of Heideck departed from us on the 9th of August by ship to Magdeburg, as he was summoned by them. May God grant him success. He has disguised himself in strange colors; we hope he will accomplish something great.</p>
      <p>The cities are said to have promised help to the people of Magdeburg, and there is a rumor that the Margrave's forces, with 600 horses, have demanded the city to surrender; the people of Magdeburg are said to have come out through another gate, attacked the enemy, and put them to flight. These have fallen into the hands of the Count of Mansfeld, who wanted to assist the people of Magdeburg, and it is said that few of these knights escaped. If only it were so, and the wicked would finally recognize what they are doing, how treacherously they betray the evangelical truth.</p>
      <p>The Elector Margrave, along with others, is consulting, sending envoys to the Emperor to inquire what should be done; for he fears for himself. Maurice is acting insanely and almost killed his brother Augustus; the worst man has the worst conscience. He must have 300 horses and 200 landsknechts waiting for him; he has a closed bed in which he lies, for at night the furies torment him, causing him to wake up and fall over the bed, where the iron bars are not placed in front. Lipsensis told me, who was in his court, that they make him drink heavily at night so that he can sleep; for thus he is tormented by Satan. He will undoubtedly have a very bad end.</p>
      <p>These things from Saxony. From Strasbourg, 14th of August: As for our church, everything remains in the same state as it has for a long time. The bishop and his followers make several attempts, but they do not achieve what they desire, and if I am not mistaken, the spirits of the council are rising and reviving. We recently heard that they responded vigorously to the bishop. In our region, some are recalling their ministers to service, though not the primary ones.</p>
      <p>Similarly, my prince of Zweibr체cken and some other rulers have done the same; the Baron of Nassau, although he rejoices in war and is entirely loyal to the Emperor, still loves the gospel. I will also tell this: he has given all preachers leave, for none wanted to accept the Interim; thus, some remained in the land, and some left; Erasmus Sarcerius was accepted by Duke Maurice, preached in Leipzig on the 21st of July, and was sent to a city to preach the gospel, as the count had no preacher. He petitioned the Emperor to provide him with a mass servant. Some have come, but they were poorly received by the peasants and secretly told not to come again, or they would be killed by the peasants. This has frightened many mass priests; for the count is said to be a tyrant, although he adheres to the gospel.</p>
      <p>When no response came from the court, he himself mounted and rode to the Emperor, told him his concerns; the Emperor allowed him to reinstate his pastors, except for the primary ones and doctors. Satan knows how to arrange this. Thus, he has recalled all his pastors; they preach the gospel again with greater effectiveness than ever. The Count of Hanau has done the same, reinstating all his preachers except for Pantaleon, who is now in Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>The Count of Zweibr체cken has written a supplicatory booklet at the Emperor's request, explaining how he was raised in the faith from youth, knows no other, and reads only from the New and Old Testament; if he were to be instructed otherwise from divine scripture, it would be right for him to follow it, and he is willing. He also wrote about the power the Emperor has and in what matters, what is owed to him, and what is owed to God.</p>
      <p>I would have sent letters given to the council if I could have obtained them and extorted them from our people; but I will soon ensure that you have whatever it is, so that you know and others know that we have not consented nor will consent to such an oath, although some have defected from us, who value popular favor more than the glory of Christ. Certainly, a great contention arises among us about the French alliance. Spicula adheres to the French captains and refutes what we publish against such an unjust king; Spicula will eventually perish badly.</p>
      <p>Consensus Tigurinus. When will you send the Confession approved by Calvin and Farel regarding the matter of the Eucharist? Some French have spread it among us; but I could not obtain it. Sulcerus says he did not copy it, Myconius the same, although it is hard to believe that they did not copy it, or they are ashamed that they have so far burdened you with false suspicion, as if you did not agree with us.</p>
      <p>What the papal legate did with the donkey, you undoubtedly know from Myconius.</p>
      <p>Captain Laetus came to us today on a post horse; what he intends to do, we still do not know. Soon our idle men, who breathe war and detest peace, flew to him.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, 23rd of August. Extend many greetings to Theodor, Pellican, and Rudolf.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius.</p>
      <p>Not all of Sturm's booklets are printed in octavo, some in quarto, such as "On the Lost Art of Speaking," etc.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned and worthy master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Z체rich, my dear esteemed lord, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
