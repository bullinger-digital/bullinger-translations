      <p> Greetings. The letters I am sending to you, most kind Mr. Bullinger, from Mr. Haller, I received on this very day, although they were written by him some time ago. In sending them, I hope to gain some favor with both of you, which is my sole aim. For since I owe you much and wish to express my gratitude for your merits towards me, nothing can be more pleasing to me than to provide an opportunity to demonstrate my mutual goodwill towards you. Indeed, I have nothing else to write at this time, and even if there were something, Mr. von Stetten relieves me of that task, as he writes to you often, thoroughly, and diligently. Therefore, you will forgive the brevity, not only for the reason I have mentioned but also due to the haste of the courier, who had many letters to deliver to Constance. </p>
      <p> Farewell then, my dear Mr. Bullinger, and love me, and greet your family with my words. Farewell. July 3, 1570. </p>
      <p> Matthias Schenck, yours. </p>
      <p> To the honorable, well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, my kind lord in Zurich. </p>
