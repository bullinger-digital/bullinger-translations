      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, I sincerely pray, and I diligently commend my respect, dedication, and service to you. Among the many things I have always wished for, I have certainly always considered it most important, most reverend father, that I might be divinely granted both the strength and the timely opportunities to demonstrate my services to those who could rightfully expect grateful service from me, so that I might never seem to have failed in my duties. For how could I more suitably adorn the role I have taken on than by maintaining with the best reasons the goodwill of those who have shown me such remarkable kindness and whose favor, sought for excellent reasons and finally obtained through many efforts, has been of the greatest use to me, and whose past conversations, which I still experience daily, are a source of great pleasure and benefit to me, even in my absence. Among these, since divine kindness has offered you to me as the foremost, most esteemed father, I do not see who could more rightfully claim me entirely for themselves than your revered piety. However, since my conscience silently reproaches me for having performed my duties less diligently over the course of nearly a year, and your letters, which you have not hesitated to send to me frequently out of your singular piety, remind me of the duties I have neglected.</p>
      <p>I think I must rather descend to a humble plea for pardon and submit myself to your most kind judgment, using more extensive excuses. Although they are so great and serious that, apart from your most indulgent disposition towards me, to which I always defer, they alone would easily suffice to protect me from harsher criticism, my return from you coincided with a time when I could scarcely catch my breath from a long journey. I had to go immediately to the Lublin Diet of the Kingdom, not by my own choice, but by the will of those whom I recognize as the pious patrons and nurturers of the church, and to whom I confess I owe much. They, for some reason persuaded about me, believed my presence would be useful to them, and almost unwillingly dragged me along on that journey. However, this Diet was extended over a considerable period, namely eleven months. Then, after long weariness, upon my return, I was offered a journey to Hungary to the Prince of Transylvania, which I also had to undertake for very important reasons. These were my main and most serious journeys, besides many particular trips, so that it is not without reason that this business is said to be the life of a man on earth. But do you think that upon my return from Hungary, I was granted even a little rest during that whole time? Indeed, I am so overwhelmed by the burden of affairs that I often groan under it. All the people of Krakow and many other noble young men who live with me can testify to this, and perhaps one day they will testify more extensively in person. Although I do not consider any business so important that I should neglect the duty owed to you and your revered paternity, that is, to your fellow students, my most esteemed teachers, yet some hope, I do not know what, often persuaded me to postpone the labor of writing to more convenient times and opportunities, and snatched the pen from my hands when I was at work. Indeed, there were men of the greatest authority among us, most observant of your revered piety, who repeatedly promised to add their letters to mine and were only waiting for the opportunity to write about the most serious matters.</p>
      <p>Add to this that, while we were in such suspense, a certain breeze began to blow, which raised my hope that I would soon fly to you myself, so that I might personally make up for the lack of the most abundant letters and, on that journey (which I did not doubt would be most pleasant to me because of your most desired company), somehow refresh myself from the tedious anxieties. And you know, as often happens, that while vain hope pushes empty hope like wave upon wave, time passes without effect, opportunities are lost, and our duties are nevertheless missed. Now, therefore, since I see that the affairs that should have preceded my journey to you are proceeding smoothly, and I hope henceforth to learn from the fisherman's stroke, I write as quickly as I can, yet sufficiently abundantly, about our public and private matters, so that I may send to you a heap of responses, as if piled into one mound, which seemed to be expected by the various subjects of your letters. Necessity demands that I first ask you to allow me to obtain pardon for the diligence hitherto neglected, which I indeed acknowledge to be such a great fault that, unless I believed you retained a fresh memory of my previous diligence in this kind of duty, I would be at a loss as to where to turn in this case. Therefore, your truly paternal affection towards me, which I have always experienced, will grant me pardon.</p>
      <p>The same will be obtained from you by the serious consideration of my inevitable affairs, which have hitherto driven me under the harshest yoke of necessity, indeed of impossibility.</p>
      <p>I know that the memory of my former diligence will also have some weight with you, which (such is your singular virtue in weighing the duties of friends) you always used to value more highly than they actually were. Finally, you will also consider that it is human to often rely on vain hope and that we are not infrequently mistaken in the outcomes of our plans, which I too, in common with other mortals, have experienced, and it should not be considered strange or new. But to cease being excessive in this part, I will address the main purpose.</p>
      <p>And first, briefly about the state of our churches, which, although not much different from what it was three years ago, nevertheless, as is the perpetual fate of the church, it can scarcely be said how many things keep us anxious in these most turbulent times. We must contend with prudent simplicity against the papists, who strangely delight in the dissensions that the sectarians have brought into the church, and who, by all means, as long as they hinder our efforts, nourish and promote them, who would certainly have behaved more submissively towards us long ago if the devil had not brought this irreconcilable schism into the assembly of Christ through the Arians, Tritheists, Anabaptists, and finally the Ebionites (whom I shudder to even name).</p>
      <p>To whose strangely growing glory thatαλαστςρ (evil spirit) had envied, if he could not have known it by any shorter way than by the invention of new doctrines. Although many magnates persist with us on the true foundation and do not entirely defect to the adversaries, yet these dissensions have had the effect among them that they no longer seek the things of God as much as their own.</p>
      <p>Thus, charity has grown cold in the minds of men, and indeed all piety is almost entirely overthrown.</p>
      <p>To this is added that in our assembly, the distraction of minds into various opinions has finally provided the occasion that the most desired discipline and order cannot be established, which is also increased by the ignorance, infidelity, and ingratitude of some ministers towards those who, far removed from us by a very long distance, fight so much for our churches and indeed for the very sacred truth. Among these is Sarnicius, that little hypocrite, who with his ambition disturbs good order and tries to lead some churches away from the pure sincere confession of your Swiss churches to some kind of semi-papist confession, but he achieves nothing, for all except a very few oppose him, and especially the nobles of the kingdom and the more excellent ministers resist him most vigorously and reject him as ambitious and ignorant. I have been entrusted by the general synod of all the provinces with the task of translating your confession into the Polish language, which all the evangelical estates wish to offer to the king as their confession at the next Diet. Nor do our palatines doubt that the king will approve it, which I will also send to you in the Polish language afterwards.</p>
      <p>The very learned book by the most learned Dr. Simler, published in the controversy about the Holy Trinity, and your preface in particular, have also greatly helped us and all our people. Our magnates received them with the greatest gratitude, read them eagerly, and were greatly confirmed by them. When the book was presented to Cardinal Hosius by the palatines to be read, he was struck dumb at the reading of your preface and denied ever having written anything against those churches, and in order to more easily obtain leave from the Diet, so that he would not be questioned by the king about the same matter, he offered his own to the king, so that on his way to Rome he might report the papal approval of the divorce between the king and queen. On this journey, he showed how disastrous a man he is to the people of Brieg in Silesia, where, in return for the hospitality with which the citizens had most honorably treated him, the most ungrateful man either through his own design or the carelessness of his followers set fire to the city, which almost entirely burned down in a miserable manner. However, he escaped the present fury of the citizens because, when the fire broke out, he had already rushed out of the gates on the fastest horses.</p>
      <p>But I return to the state of the church. At the time of the dissolution of the Diet held in Lublin, our king reminded the nobles of the kingdom to consider diligently, among the matters they should approach with prudent premeditation in the following Diet, how the diversity of doctrines in the church might be addressed, so that public tranquility might be conveniently provided for. What will happen now is in the hand of God, and we hope for better things and fear worse. We greatly fear that, given the opportunity to treat those sectarians more harshly, we too may be counted among their number and that severity may be exercised against us as well. In the meantime, we also hold synods and with long deliberation prepare ourselves for the future acts of the Diet with this translation of your confession, which will be offered by the nobles of the kingdom and all our churches as the entire body of doctrine sounding and teaching in our churches. However, we commend the outcome of all our plans to God, the best and greatest.</p>
      <p>But perhaps you wish to know somewhat what was done in the past Diet, which lasted almost 11 months, about which you may briefly know this: The Lithuanian nation, very numerous and the duchy itself very powerful, had not hitherto been united with the Kingdom of Poland, but only connected, so that when the king ceased to live, they could easily have chosen another duke than the king of Poland, whoever he might be. From which, if it had happened, anyone can easily see how much inconvenience could have returned to our kingdom. Therefore, our kings and nobles labored for almost 140 years with the greatest efforts to bring these nations into such a union that Lithuania would no longer be considered a duchy, but both the nation and the kingdom would be considered solely Polish, so that the laws would be common, and the kingdom and finally access to the degrees of dignity in the administration of the kingdom and provinces would be equally open to both nations.</p>
      <p>Which divine kindness finally granted us in this Diet after indefatigable labors. May the Lord grant that this union may last perpetually, most firmly and most beneficially for our kingdom!</p>
      <p>In the same Diet, the Emperor of the Turks requested passage through the borders of Poland for his army against the Muscovites. After our nobles had long and much deliberated on this matter, I do not know how, but passage was finally granted to the Turkish forces, namely 75,000, who were all reduced to 6,000 in Muscovy by plague, hunger, cold, and sword, who alone escaped safely.</p>
      <p>A most splendid embassy was also decreed, such as had never before been sent to the Prince of the Muscovites, and two nobles of the highest dignity are now urging the journey to Muscovy, who wanted to add me, miserable and broken by so many journeys, to themselves (for both are patrons of our churches), unless the Palatine of Krakow, with the highest intercessions, had freed me, just as I was about to set out on the journey. A most desired peace is hoped for between these nations, and all the more so because, with the wife of the Muscovite deceased, there is a rumor that he will marry the sister of our king on the condition that he restores certain territories taken from our kingdom, which, if it happens, there is no doubt that this affinity will be a bond of closer concord.</p>
      <p>You also wanted to know about the King of Transylvania, whether it was true, as is commonly spread in Germany, that he was elected King of Poland. That was indeed about to happen, as could be gathered from certain indications. But after he defected to the Arians and became a patron of the sectarians, he greatly alienated the minds of the Polish nobility with this impiety, and there is no longer any thought among our people of anything like that towards him. Our great Palatine was very surprised that you were so occupied with the accounts of Johann Miscovius that you were not reluctant to note every little detail with your own hand. For this concern of yours, although he was somewhat saddened, he could not but receive it with the greatest gratitude, that such an exact account of his nephew's affairs was kept by you, such a great man, and he is not only content with all matters but also gives you great thanks. Our Johann Miscovius had planned to go to Italy, but when he was on his way, he fell into a very serious illness at the borders of Poland, so that, beyond everyone's expectation, he somehow escaped from this evil and is not yet fully sane in mind. I have no doubt that God preserved him from much greater evils with this misfortune. My Caspar lives with me privately.</p>
      <p>Your books and those of Dr. Simler, sent as gifts, were faithfully delivered to those to whom they were intended and to whom you sent them, who received them with the greatest gratitude. And they were about to write letters to you long ago to give thanks, but they were prevented from this duty by the most serious affairs of the kingdom. However, they remain in the same intention, whose gratitude you will soon experience, especially Dr. Zupparius, who has now become the treasurer of the kingdom. In the handling of the affairs of our Jodocus [Szadkowski?], the reason we seemed somewhat remiss and have not yet responded was the death of his parent, a most pious man, who, after long struggling with serious illnesses, finally died with great sorrow for many, having first made a pious and steadfast confession in the truth and having arranged his affairs well. How much his death was a grief to me and many other excellent men can scarcely be said, which also disturbed me not a little and prevented me from writing promptly. He left guardians of his children and goods, grave and distinguished men, namely the treasurer of the kingdom (who was formerly Zupparius and to whom you sent both letters and your book), another the great procurator of Krakow, Dr. Decius, and others, among whom he also appointed me. Therefore, as far as Jodocus's affairs are concerned, they want the death of his father to be concealed, for they think it will be more expedient for him, so that the young man does not exult in the hope of a freer life, and they want him to remain with you at least until the end of the second year, so that he may return more equipped with language.</p>
      <p>They do not want him to go to Geneva. In the meantime, they entrust entirely to your singular piety and prudence how much money should be paid for his sustenance during this second year, and they earnestly ask that the remaining money be managed with such frugality that some may be reserved for expenses on his return. If not, let them know by your letters before he leaves Zurich, and money will be sent immediately by the lords for the journey. Indeed, it would be most useful for him to remain with you until he is recalled by the letters of his guardians.</p>
      <p>But above all, I give thanks to your revered paternity, most kind father, in my name and in the name of the nobles who favor us, especially for that diligence in communicating with us the news heard about the French wars, which I also share with the magnates, so that only your letters encourage us not to be overwhelmed by the papists' fabricated novelties. We also earnestly ask that you do not hesitate to continue this kind of service to us, as it is most useful and most welcome.</p>
      <p>We, for our part, will be much more diligent in responding than you have experienced so far.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I most respectfully greet you, most excellent and kind father, with all your fellow students, my esteemed teachers and lords, and commend your pious and honorable family to the hands of God the protector.</p>
      <p>Given in Krakow, 12th of the calends of February, 1570. Your most devoted and observant Christophorus Thretius.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend and Most Illustrious... Lord Heinrich Bullinger... most excellent servant of Jesus Christ,... Antistes of the Church of Zurich,... my esteemed lord and father.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
