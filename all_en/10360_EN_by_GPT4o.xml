    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for sending the text of the First Basel Confession, as well as for Myconius' response. Based on his report on the situation in Germany, he fears strong war efforts by France against the Emperor, who might eventually turn against the Protestant princes and cities. He characterizes the selfish politics of the powerful: The Pope desires the extermination of the Protestants, King Francis I the possession of Milan and Naples. Bullinger criticizes the German princes and cities for not remaining loyal to the Emperor. God's punishment will strike the Protestants who disregard peace and want to ignite a war within Germany desired by the French. Greetings to Jakob Meyer.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I owe you, most illustrious man, eternal thanks for gifting me the booklet and responding so kindly. I beseech you, continue to do good always.</p>
      <p>The matters you mention about Hesse and Gallus, as well as the Augsburg delegation, are more troubling than can be expressed. I fear a French scheme is at play. The Pope has not yet been able to provoke the Emperor to our ruin, as the prince is not entirely evil. What if, by this artifice, the Emperor's arms are provoked against the Christian princes and cities? The Pope thinks only of how to eradicate religion.</p>
      <p>The French King thinks only of how to gain possession of Milan and the Kingdom of Naples. The outcomes of this tragedy are different. There is no trust in the princes. Each seeks his own advantage. The Pope thinks: If through the friendship of the French and Germans you could make the Emperor hostile to the Germans, you would have won. Even if the French were to perish together, you would reconcile yourself to the Emperor with minimal effort, as he is a man easy and merciful. The French King thinks: If you could gain Milan and Naples through the work of the Pope and the Germans, then you would not even value the Pope or the Germans. The Emperor is hostile. The French King aspires to the Empire, thinks of avenging the Pavia injury, and briefly desires the Emperor's downfall. The princes and cities do not see this or do not want to see it, they violate the faith given to the Emperor, and thus heap coals upon their own heads. You will see, dearest brother, that we will soon pay the penalty for the despised gospel and the blood of the peasants shed. Is it not a shameful thing that we undertake internal wars in Germany for the sake of the French, when we could enjoy peace? Who offends or oppresses the cities? Have they not believed freely until now? Did they not also need the Emperor's protection in peace? But thus the Lord's vengeance hastens. Would that I were a vain prophet. There is no loyalty anywhere.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray diligently to the Lord, that He may be with us.</p>
      <p>February 23, 1534.</p>
      <p>I wish our common father well.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, minister of the church in Basel, dearest brother.</p>
