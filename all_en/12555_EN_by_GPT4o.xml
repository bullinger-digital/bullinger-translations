    <p xml:id="regest1">Just as Bullinger always shows himself obliging [with his letters], Myconius also takes every opportunity to send letters. However, there is not much to report. The people of Strasbourg send hardly any news. Instead, they constantly complain about an alleged lack of a sense of duty among the Swiss Confederates. One [Martin Bucer] of Myconius' five correspondents from Strasbourg wrote that the Confederates are hastening their own end by consenting to the downfall of the [Schmalkaldic League]. Myconius replied today that the [Protestant Confederates], as Christians and Germans, are doing what is possible for them within the framework of their sworn oath, even if this does not meet the expectations [of the people of Strasbourg]. They are aware that the godless Ghent [Emperor Charles V] would not spare them in the event of a victory. Therefore, they are closely monitoring what he undertakes. What if one were to proceed against those who do not want to acknowledge the cunning plots of Charles V against Swiss freedom, as Myconius once discussed in detail with Bullinger?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- What Bullinger reported about [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse from a letter by Vadian [not received] brings great joy to Myconius, for as long as the princes do not arrest the Emperor, everything can only get worse, even if the [Schmalkaldic League] should initially be successful. The Emperor would then resort to other means.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- According to a Bavarian [Adam Hellmeyer], [Philip of] Hesse, after a severe defeat [against a Dutch army], ultimately emerged victorious. To learn more, the people of Basel sent a messenger [...] to Strasbourg. The news turned out to be an empty rumor. However, the Bavarian had left Basel in a hurry to avoid paying a fine.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- A third muster was held in Basel. The pious are vigilant. However, some, who appear orthodox in their expressions, are so imbued with the Epicurean spirit that they do not care if everything around them perishes, as long as their own well-being is secure.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The former chief guild master [Blasius Sch√∂lli] recounted how [the Basel council] learned of four hundred horsemen passing through Alsace. A scout was immediately sent [...], who determined that the horsemen came from the army of the French [King Francis I] and were returning home. Many Alsatians wanted to know from the scout whether it was true that 20,000 Confederates were gathered around Basel to take Alsace. When they heard that this was not the case, they were disappointed, as they hoped to finally be freed [from the Emperor]. What if the fear of an invasion by the Zurichers [was intended] to justify the stationing of [imperial] soldiers in the Hegau?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Myconius does not yet know the stance of the Seven [Catholic] Cantons on the current unrest. He asks for any news. Something is likely to happen soon!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You are always obliging. Indeed, I do what I can. For there is no courier whom I do not entrust with something. There is often a lack of things to write about.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>For the people of Strasbourg are, I do not know whether to say more negligent or more fearful, than to report what is happening. They are constantly complaining about us, as if we are not fulfilling our duty. "Many," says one of them (for there are five who write regularly), "predict ill of your people, that they are hastening their own destruction by turning a blind eye to ours." "Indeed," I replied today, "that we are doing what seems to you to be more idle. Yet we do what we can. Those who have the gospel do not cease - this I say freely and truly. You cannot impose more on us. We remember that we are Christians and Germans, and that the Ghent [Emperor Charles V] will not spare us if he achieves his goal (which God forbid). In the meantime, we cannot presume anything against the treaties! Yet it is and will be a concern for the good, what Charles attempts - a glorious and insolent and impious man." Thus I am accustomed to excuse us as best I can. Now I say to you: What if we were to act against those who stubbornly refuse to understand what Charles is attempting against Swiss freedom cunningly (which I have often discussed with you)? If it is not done freely, the Swiss Confederation is doomed (whatever the Ghent [Emperor] may promise), if the Lord does not wish to regard His word and His people. I speak humanly. May the Lord do all things according to His good will. Only may He keep us from evil!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Furthermore, what you wrote about [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse from Vadian, good God, how it pleased me! For I am of this mind: Unless Charles falls into the hands of the princes, the latter days will be far worse than the former, even if everything falls out happily for us. For since this did not succeed, he will proceed by another way, and perhaps by a more fortunate one. But the Lord will see to it.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>About the same Hesse, a certain Bavarian here had stirred up that he had suffered a great defeat, yet had obtained victory. This matter had so moved our people that they sent a messenger to Strasbourg. He reported that it was a vanity and that such a Bavarian should be dealt with a fitting reward. But he had soon left when he heard the messenger was sent.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>A third muster was held by our people, so that they are prepared for any event. I see so far an eagerness in the pious, although there are those who wish that everything would perish, as long as it would be well with them - so much has Epicureanism prevailed. They speak well of God and of Christ, and also of the Antichrist, which is true, but there is no amendment of life!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>A few days ago, an old tribune met and during the conversation, he narrated this: A troop of four hundred horsemen came through Alsace these days.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Upon learning this, one of ours was sent to find out what was going on. It was answered that they were coming from the army of the French and returning home. Then many in Alsace approached our man asking whether it was true that twenty thousand Swiss were gathered in Basel to occupy Alsace. He replied that it was nothing. They exclaimed: "God have mercy! We thought we would finally be delivered!" But what if fear commands the distribution of soldiers through the Hegau, lest any incursions be made by yours? Indeed, I plainly interpret it this way.</p>
      <p>What the Seven [Catholic] Cantons think about the present tumults, I have not yet been able to understand. If you have anything (as you do), please let me know. Otherwise, silence prevails.</p>
      <p>It is strange if something does not soon suddenly break out. May the Lord Jesus, whose word we have received and honor, grant that we may pursue the same as best we can. Let it be so!</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours and all the brothers. Hastily, Basel, July 22, 1546. Yours, O. Myco.</p>
      <p>To the most learned D. Heinrich Bullinger, his brother in the Lord, very much to be respected.</p>
