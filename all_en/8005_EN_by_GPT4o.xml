      <p>S. D. You recently recommended to me the excellent man, Mr. Johann Baptist von Feuer, the standard-bearer from Klaven. I helped him as much as I could, especially by writing a petition to the Republic of Bern, requesting a recommendation to the Council of Chur and the Lords of the Three Leagues. I obtained it with good grace; for both the consul and the treasurers are, due to their kindness, very friendly to me. However, I was instructed to send anything I obtain to you and to Mr. Willius, the most distinguished man. Therefore, I wrote letters to Mr. Willius and enclosed the letters from Bern, asking him to deal with them faithfully and prudently. You also should do your duty in this matter; I believe he spoke to both of you about it. Mr. Willius knows what needs to be done, whether it is appropriate for him to keep the letters with him until Mr. Johann Baptist von Feuer comes to Chur and delivers the letters himself, or for Mr. Willius to deliver them. I also wrote to Mr. von Feuer about this matter and ask you to ensure that the letters, which I have enclosed with yours, are delivered to him promptly. I could not handle this business more faithfully and diligently; therefore, you also should ask him to consider it favorably and greet all friends.</p>
      <p>News from France from August 12th to the 16th of the same month: In the city of Poitiers, there are 2 young Guises, Mr. Montpensier, many lords, knights, and nobles along with 6000 good soldiers and no fewer shovels, trenches, and fortifications being erected, etc. And since there are so many people in the city, they are lacking provisions. The admiral has besieged it hard with the king's artillery, which he has captured, and with 12000 horsemen and 25000 foot soldiers; he has bombarded it in two places for an assault, prepared 3000 scaling ladders for the assault; he has diverted the water and led it elsewhere; he has blocked all roads and passes to and from them. The young man from Molüch wanted to go in with 1200, was captured, and his people were defeated.</p>
      <p>The king is preparing for Tours; his brother is with him. His foreign troops, German knights, and Swiss Confederates are still in Loches, waiting for the king's advance.</p>
      <p>The king's brother is very displeased with Aumale for allowing the German knights to enter France over so many passes and waters, Aumale is away from the court, and the cardinal, his brother, is also not very well regarded. So much for the latest news. Now, however, further rumors are coming, though conflicting: first, that the admiral had to withdraw in disgrace and with losses on August 27th; second, that the admiral forcibly captured Poitiers on August 28th, killed and captured the soldiers there, killed the younger Guise and Montpensier in the assault, took the elder with many lords and captives to La Rochelle, and is now moving with all his equipment to another city, Lyon, etc.</p>
      <p>However, the name has slipped my mind, etc. Which of these is true, I cannot yet say; but since those in the city are well equipped with soldiers and trench diggers, and the king, along with his brother, is vigorously preparing for the relief, and surely the lords inside will not soon be abandoned, nor will they soon surrender, knowing what is at stake for them, it seems to me that the admiral, if he is still there, is in enough danger. May God turn it for the best and grant a gracious peace, so that poor France is not so miserably destroyed. And if it were won, as many write and say, it might perhaps bring peace sooner. May God grant it!</p>
      <p>This is what I had to write. I have not received anything from you today; if you have any news about the Moors, Turks, Spaniards, and Italians, share it and greet the consuls, Mr. Pontisella.</p>
      <p>Ganthner and Mr. Ruinella and other friends. The news I have noted down, we have from Lyon, Geneva, Neuchâtel, Bern, and some other places.</p>
      <p>Farewell. I wrote very quickly. September 16, 1569.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Friends, and especially our Ernius, greet you.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my honorable lord and beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
