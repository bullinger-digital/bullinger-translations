      <p>That I do not write to you often, most illustrious man, as I ought, do not think that I have either forgotten you or am not moved by reverence or that I cease from a lack of love; none of these is the case. For I both highly respect you and love you singularly, and you never fade from my memory, since your works, which present themselves to my eyes daily, imprint you on my mind in such a way that you cannot be erased by any means. Rather, attribute it, if there is any fault in me, to my age and old age, but more so to the timidity of my nature; for when nothing worthy of you, that you might be advised by my letters, occurs to me, I fear to detain a man otherwise very busy with the greatest matters in reading my letters. Therefore, take my tardiness in good part, man of God.</p>
      <p>Our Marius, to whom I write more extensively, will inform you more fully about the cause of Christ Jesus, which is being conducted among us; if you can bring any help and assistance, as you truly can, know that it is all dedicated to God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ, not to men. Farewell well in the Lord.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus Christ keep you safe for us. Chiavenna, on the Nones of June 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Agostino Mainardi.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious lord, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, distinguished expositor of divine scripture.</p>
