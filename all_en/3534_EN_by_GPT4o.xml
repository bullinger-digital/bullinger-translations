      <p>My dear brother-in-law Peter Schär writes to me at this time that there is great preparation in Württemberg, and they have excellently fortified Stuttgart and Urach against the emperor, who is then supposed to come there for the coronation in Frankfurt and from there to ride to Innsbruck. It will cost the duke a lot of good money; but such a jest (he writes) will not go without great harm. He sends you his friendly, willing service and many greetings, etc.</p>
