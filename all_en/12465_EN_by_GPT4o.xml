    <p xml:id="regest1">At Bullinger's request, Erb sends a letter, which is delivered by Heini [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Erb had written to Bullinger [No. 2333] that the Mömpelgard church had been pacified again. But a few days ago, Satan, through [Johannes] Engelmann, instigated a new conflict. Now it is demanded that every believer be examined by the pastor on the day before receiving communion and receive absolution from him. However, since this practice was not customary, is not required in the Bible (consider Paul's words in [1 Corinthians 11:28]), and was even rejected by Nektarios (as Eusebius [of Caesarea] testifies), Erb advised [Pierre] Toussain to entrust the matter to Duke Ulrich [of Württemberg] and his officials, especially since the latter had already managed to settle the previous dispute [in Mömpelgard]. A response is still awaited.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Erb is pleased that Erasmus [Schmid] has preceded him into immortality. When Schmid left Riquewihr [1538], Crispin [König] offered to take over Schmid's books but could not pay for them after his dismissal by [Count Georg of Württemberg]. Erb then declared himself willing to sell the books. He still has some of them but has forwarded the money to Schmid, as [receipts] prove. Bullinger should inform the widow [Martha, née Blarer] of this. Schmid and Erb had long wanted to meet. Now it is too late. As far as Erb knows, none of the colleagues still owe anything.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Veit Dietrich did not respond to Erb's letter. He will consider his opinion correct and Erb a foolish donkey. However, Erb is by no means willing to approve of Dietrich's view of the worship of Christ in the [communion].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Germany trembles as the Emperor [Charles V] allies with the enemies of the Gospel. The Protestants are also consulting to avoid being surprised by the enemies. A war is imminent. In March, the Protestants held a [diet] in Frankfurt. The fearless [Philipp] of Hesse went to the Emperor despite fears that he might be intercepted by the enemies. According to Count [Georg], the Emperor demanded the release of [Duke Heinrich] of Brunswick.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- [Elector Friedrich II of the] Palatinate is inadequately reforming his church. Although Christ is proclaimed, superstition, especially concerning relics, is still tolerated as in the churches of Wittenberg and Brandenburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Duke Ulrich [of Württemberg], [Philipp] of Hesse, and [Friedrich II of the] Palatinate will meet in Heidelberg. They are afraid because the Emperor has raised a mighty army and 3000 horsemen in the Netherlands and minted many coins. Count [Georg] believes that the Pope [Paul III] is urging the Emperor to incite the German princes and cities against each other, only to then retreat to Spain and wash his hands in innocence like Pilate.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Bullinger will have heard of Luther's death. A returned scholar [...] from Riquewihr attended the funeral. Luther's body was brought on a wagon accompanied by 50 horsemen from Eisleben to Wittenberg, received there by the residents and scholars, led to the Castle Church with bell ringing and funeral songs, and buried next to the mausoleum of the Saxon princes. Philipp [Melanchthon] gave a long speech.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- The religious discussion [in Regensburg] ended without result. Dietrich wrote to [Johannes] Ulstetter that the opponents negotiated more through intimidation than based on the Holy Scriptures. The monk from Colmar [Johannes Hoffmeister] and [the Emperor's court preacher] Pedro de Malvenda are said to have dressed up during the carnival and danced with nuns.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Greetings from Chancellor [Sigismund Stier] and scribe [Oswald Fürstenlob]. Greetings also to [Konrad] Pellikan, [Theodor] Bibliander, and [Rudolf] Gwalther.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- At Erb's instruction, Gerold [Meyer von Knonau the Younger] sends the statements of a new pasquinade.</p>

      <p>May the grace of the Lord be with you. As you advised, most learned Bullinger, I am doing so through our faithful Heini, the messenger, by burdening you with my fasting and somewhat barbaric letters, while you are, if I am not mistaken, occupied with more serious matters in the name of the church. However, since you, with your unique humanity and wisdom, always interpret the writings of the imprudent kindly, I do not at all seek to excuse my fault. For you know and understand Erb, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Regarding our affairs, this: I had recently written to you that the church of Montbéliard, pacified by the counsel of the good, had come to peace. But Satan, through Engelmann or, if you prefer, with his Satander, the enemies of all peace and concord, propagated a new invention, a seed of new discord, a few days ago. This is, namely, that those who approach the holy supper of Christ should present themselves individually (and, if I may say so, woman by woman) to the minister of the church the day before to be examined, expecting judgment and absolution from him. However, since this custom is unusual for us and not derived from the word of God (as the divine Paul says: "Let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of that bread" [1 Corinthians 11:28], etc.) and since it was also abolished under Nectarius, as is found in Eusebius, and left to the conscience of each individual, nor do we allow any profane persons to penetrate these sacred symbols with unwashed feet, I consulted Toussain, who would refer the whole matter with our writings, reasons, and arguments to the court of Duke Ulrich and his officials, who are by no means superstitious. For they are the ones who previously also helped the wavering church to the best of their ability, and we do not doubt that the gracious God, who recently defended the causes of his church against adversaries, will not now abandon us. We have not yet received a response. Thus, we stand by the judgment of the courtiers. But God has so far supported the truth through their decision. If they were ever to side with the superstitious, they would undoubtedly have among us also solid defenders of the truth. Therefore, pray to the Lord that we may stand firm in the confession of the truth through Christ.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I rejoice that Erasmus has been healed from such a long and severe illness by the grace of God and has been translated to the glory of immortality. By sending him ahead, we have by no means lost him. Soon, when it pleases the gracious God, we will follow. While we still stand in danger and battle, he now triumphs gloriously with Christ. He has received with a full hand that for which we continually sigh. O immortal glory, when will you come? Leaving here in previous years, Erasmus had sold his books to Crispin. However, being dismissed by the prince, he could not pay. He left us the books. Therefore, I finally took it upon myself to sell them, and not all are sold yet. Nevertheless, I paid Erasmus, as the receipts of both parties speak. If you have time, please call the widow and inform her of all matters. Erasmus and I had been expecting to meet for several years to settle the debt, but the Fates interrupted it. If the account is correct, let her provide the receipt, which they call quittance. If not, write back. You will receive a kind response from me. Among the brothers, I know of no one who owes anything. If the widow thinks otherwise, they will also respond.</p>

      <p>Veit Dietrich did not respond to my letters; I do not care much about that. For he thinks he has written correctly if it does not displease gods and men, and considers me a foolish and truly asinine person unworthy of any response. But I prefer to be considered inept and foolish and worthy of no response than to appear learned by subscribing to his opinion on the adoration of Christ in the sacrament, which the entire scripture ignores and of which there are no writings or examples from the ancients (who rightly understood piety), and which the analogy of our faith does not admit. I am tired of writing more about this gross adoration.</p>

      <p>More news, as spring always tends to spread something new among the warlike Germans. Germany trembles. For the Emperor, nurturing a monster with the enemies of the gospel, is accustomed to practice with the adversaries of Christ in many clandestine meetings. Everywhere there is a rush, and our people are consulting to avoid being suddenly overwhelmed by the adversaries. They have an expedition ready. Furthermore, the Protestants recently convened quickly in March in Frankfurt to consult on something. For immediately, each returned to his own. The Landgrave of Hesse, called, went to the Emperor; many had dissuaded him, fearing he might be intercepted by the adversaries. But the magnanimous prince despised threats, even death. They say the Emperor praised the heroic spirit of the prince. Our prince says the Emperor demanded the release of the robber of Brunswick from the Landgrave and the Protestants. Hence, neither side trusts the other. What if the sword were to remain in its sheath?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Elector Palatine seems to some to be reforming his church sluggishly. For there, everyone follows his own sense. The mandate is that Christ be sincerely preached. Most superstitions are tolerated by the example of other churches, such as those in Wittenberg and Brandenburg. It is to be feared that if they do not vigilantly strive, they will take deeper root and be more difficult to uproot.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>In these days, Duke Ulrich, the Landgrave of Hesse, and the Elector Palatine will meet in Heidelberg. Many fear for themselves this year, for it is known that the Emperor has conscripted a huge army of soldiers and three thousand horsemen in the Netherlands and has amassed a great amount of money. Our prince believes that the Emperor is plotting treachery against the Germans, if he can, and that he is being urged to this by the Pope and the papists, and will incite princes against princes, cities against cities, so that after he has stirred the pot, he will leave it to us to consume, himself retreating to his Spaniards and, like Pilate, testifying to his innocence by washing his hands, etc.</p>

      <p>You have heard of Luther's death, I suppose. A returned scholar from our church, who saw the funeral, reported it. From Eisleben, he was carried in a wagon to Wittenberg, accompanied by fifty horsemen, received by all the inhabitants of the town, especially the scholars, with the ringing of bells, funeral songs, and led to the church in the castle, placed in the mausoleum next to the burial of the Saxon dukes, as is the custom there to bury. Philipp gave a long speech in the college, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The colloquium has ended, about which Veit Dietrich writes to our Ulstetter: "The colloquium ended in laughter. The adversaries dealt with us more with threats and slanders than with scriptures. The monk from Colmar, having changed his attire, danced with nuns during the carnival; the same did the Emperor's Malvenda. We departed with matters unresolved."</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Farewell with all yours in Christ Jesus, our Lord. Amen. All of ours greet you, especially the chancellor, a pious man, who would like to win your favor with some small service and declare his gratitude through his work. Also, the scribe greets you, etc. You will greet yours in return, my Pellican, Bibliander, and the others, my beloved Gwalther.</p>

      <p>If you have not seen the axioms of the new pasquinade, Gerold will send them to you; I ordered him to copy them. Riquewihr, 8th day of April 1546.</p>
      <p>Your Erb.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, theologian of Zurich, esteemed brother.</p>
