      <p>Greetings. It is not out of any confidence in myself or my abilities, but solely relying on your humanity and piety, and further persuaded by the words of the most honorable man, Mr. Franziskus Lysmannin, that I dare to write these letters, however humble they may be, to your piety, most illustrious prince. Your piety will forgive me this fault, if it seems a fault at all, as it should be entirely convinced that I favor it sincerely. Therefore, I congratulate it on that blessed knowledge of the gospel of the Son of God, which it has obtained above others through the immense grace of God, and I pray to the merciful and beneficent Lord to confirm in it what He has begun, to the great extension of the glory of Christ.</p>
      <p>Nor is there any doubt, most merciful prince, that you have acquired this singular knowledge of Christ for no other purpose than to be an instigator among the holy royal majesty and other most illustrious princes, and finally among all other nobles of the kingdom, so that they too may read the sacred book of the gospel, recognize the apostolic doctrine, and then direct all their thoughts, words, and deeds according to this prescription. Indeed, no happier state can befall a man in this age than if, devoted to the holy and life-giving word of God, the gospel of God and the true man, our mediator Jesus Christ, he seeks from it all forms of living and acting; for it is most certain that this doctrine was brought from heaven, that this doctrine is most pure and not tainted by any human filth, that this doctrine leads safely and rightly to eternal life, and finally that we please the best and greatest God if we rest in this kind of doctrine and dwell in it. For it must be entirely true, that sentence of eternal truth pronounced in the gospel; "Amen, I say to you, whoever hears my word and believes him who sent me has eternal life and will not come into judgment, but has passed from death to life." Indeed, many things are brought against this doctrine today, but by those who care more for earthly things than heavenly ones. Your singular piety knows that they cannot be obeyed without the loss of life, and therefore it is prudent to examine what they advise. Among various other works, I wrote this little book three years ago, which I send, not to teach you, most excellent and learned prince, but so that you may understand from it that I am bound to you; for at the same time, I offer all my services and duties to your piety. I pray to our Lord God to keep you, with all yours, most illustrious prince, safe for a long time.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 11th of November, 1555.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious prince, Mr. Nikolaus Radziwill, Duke of Olyka and Nieswiesz, Palatine of Vilnius, Grand Marshal of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, Archchancellor of Brzesc, etc., his most merciful lord.</p>
