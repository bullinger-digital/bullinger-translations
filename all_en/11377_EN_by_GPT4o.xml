    <p xml:id="regest1">Since Vadian's request to write about marriage, he has been constantly engaged with this extensive and difficult subject; he presents to him for comment what he has found about prohibited degrees of kinship, and asks for a prompt return. Hopes that he will come to Zurich on his way home [from Baden].</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life in the Lord.</p>
      <p>From the hour you requested, most learned Vadian, that I write about the proper contracting of marriages, I have never ceased to inquire what can be said conveniently and piously on this matter, and I find it to be a very extensive subject, but entangled with many difficulties. I see that learned men often ignore and leave many things untouched. What I have found about prohibited degrees in the law, I present to you here so that you may read and add what seems necessary to be advised, and return this very copy as soon as possible; for I do not have a transcript and I am expecting this copy.</p>
      <p>See that you do not cause a delay; see finally that you do not return it unexamined. Farewell and love me. If only it were possible to obtain that you would come to us on your way home! Farewell again. December 8, 1539.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Doctor Joachim Vadian, most esteemed lord. To the Mayor of Watt.</p>
