      <p>The one you wrote would come to me, did not come; otherwise, both the nobleman from Hallwyl and Nikolaus von Diesbach would have treated him kindly. The absence of that doctor from Innsbruck deprived us of many things we eagerly wished to hear. Everything is proceeding well with the Council of Trent, since all the pious have never hoped for anything else to come from it.</p>
      <p>You will soon hear what our Bernese senate has in consultation with the King of France (I write to you). I truly fear they will make a pact with him as with the King of the Egyptians. May Christ prevent all the efforts of everyone, which would not be in favor of the course of the Gospel. These few words; my weak hand cannot write more. Farewell in the Lord, incomparable friend. Greet your wife, my dear little mother, and your whole family.</p>
      <p>My wife greets you, the castle prefect, your uncle, chief scribe Hammann, and the city prefect. Given at Lenzburg, February 3, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Gervasius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Heinrich Bullinger, lord brother and old friend in Christ most dear.</p>
