      <p>Greetings and peace from the Lord. My father, you can understand from this how little I have been in good health almost this entire month of March, as I have not yet thanked you for your book, which you recently sent to me, certainly full of piety and learning. Nor indeed does the haste of this messenger allow me to do so now in more detail, as I would especially wish.</p>
      <p>I only say that I, in the name of the whole church, congratulate you on this spirit and do not doubt that this work of yours will be both useful and especially pleasant to all the pious. May God, I say, preserve you, my father, and not cease to enrich you with His exceptional gifts for the building of His church.</p>
      <p>I think you have seen the booklet published this month, "On Not Punishing Heretics," with a preface by a certain Martin Bellius and a refutation by Basilius Monfortius. The name Magdeburg is added, but this Magdeburg, unless I am mistaken, is situated on the Rhine, where I knew these monsters have been lurking for a long time. I ask you, my father, if these things that this impious man has vomited in his preface are to be tolerated, what remains safe for us in the Christian religion?</p>
      <p>The doctrine concerning the office of Christ, the Trinity, the Lord's Supper, baptism, justification, free will, the state of souls after this life, is either useless or certainly not at all necessary for salvation: even Jews and Turks believe in God. Scripture is like Aristotle's Ethics, or certainly not much richer in doctrine, but much more uncertain.</p>
      <p>Another revelation is to be awaited. No one is to be condemned as a heretic. For all stand or fall to their own master.</p>
      <p>You see, my father, where these things tend, namely that with all the authority of Scripture undermined, we may adopt Pharisaism, and be a laughingstock not only to the papists but even to the Turks themselves.</p>
      <p>Compare, I ask, the letter of Castellio, which he prefixed to his Bible, with this blasphemous preface, and you will discover one and the same spirit in both. I have therefore decided to respond, but in such a way that I hope I will not offend those whose writings they have collected to set us against them, but I will refute their blasphemies not with insults but with truth.</p>
      <p>I have read the foolish medley of that Westphalus. Do you want me to say it in a few words? The devil indeed tries to stir up a dormant tragedy, but I think we must fight with prayers and modesty. If anyone thinks it should be answered, great judgment will be needed, lest this small spark ignite a greater fire. Certainly, his slanders are so gross that he seems hardly worthy of the labor of a response. But perhaps more on these matters another time. For whatever will be published by me, I have decided to communicate with you first before it is made public, lest I seem to undertake anything rashly or to stir up any tumults in the church of the Lord, which may the Lord cleanse from these monsters.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have nothing new to write to you, except that there is a constant rumor among us that that Jezebel of England has filled all of England with the most cruel massacres. If you have learned anything more certain, whatever it may be, let us know. Preserve, Lord, your faithful servants who are very few, or, if you have so decreed, confirm your church with their invincible patience and constancy.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father. May the Lord Jesus continue to bless you and strengthen you more and more each day. All the brothers of our entire church greet you and your church with me. Lausanne, 4th day before the Kalends of April.</p>
      <p>I ask that you hold in the highest regard the very learned man who delivers this letter to you, who is also a very dear friend to me.</p>
      <p>Th. Beza, your most devoted son in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
