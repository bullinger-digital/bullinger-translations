      <p>God be with us all, may He strengthen us in all good things.</p>
      <p>On Sunday, representatives from the seven places appeared here in ZÃ¼rich: Amandus Niederhofen, bailiff of Uri, Dietrich an der Halden, bailiff of Schwyz, and Caspar Stocker, bailiff of Zug. They requested from the mayor that they be granted counsel and citizenship. The mayor wanted to know what they intended to present. As you well know, a mayor cannot allow anyone to proceed without knowing the reason, because if something were against our sworn constitution, he cannot allow it. The envoys presented three articles: 1. about the council, 2. about insults, 3. about just men. And when the mayor argued with them about what was so important to them about the council, which does not yet exist, they replied: "The emperor gives us many good words, but he is not favorable to us, he will seek reasons to wage war against us and impose all sorts of things. If he were to impose the Interim on us, we would not accept it, and we would also consider that you would not want it either, so that a general response could be given. If a general, free, impartial, Christian council were held, we would then submit to it. Through this, we could remain on both sides according to the peace in our faith" etc., with many right and good words. When they were granted counsel and citizenship on Monday, they presented how good unity is etc., and how for the sake of unity the seven places considered this proposal. And since there is discord in faith, which has subjected the empire to the emperor, so that the same does not happen to us, the seven places consider in time and before we are pressured by the emperor, to unite. And they consider the most appropriate means to agree to a general council, what is recognized, accepted etc. 2. Since Mr. Gwalther has written a disgraceful booklet against them, they say that one should not insult each other in sermons and beyond. In particular, they are accused of having taken money from the emperor, and they request that it be disclosed who those are who took money; they want to punish them and take the money. If they cannot show it, they should be punished for their accusations. They named two women, Heinrich Gesner's wife, and also Trini Lindener, who have insulted the five places etc. 3. That one should not oppose a simple, reasonable justice against people, because denying justice brings great disorder etc. That was the proposal in summary and nothing more, except that they promised faithfully and truly to commit life and property to us and to all confederates. That is now much said. And the bailiff of Uri, who is otherwise well-spoken, spoke. Counsel and citizens are, by the grace of God, very brave, steadfast, and honest, much was said about it, but finally, it was decided to appoint 8 men to sit further on it, to prepare a response and present it back to the counsel and citizens. The envoys were told that my lords would sit on it and provide them with a response. On Monday night, they were given a gift at the Schnegg; in the morning, they rode to Schaffhausen. At night, they returned from Schaffhausen; today, they are riding back home.</p>
