      <p>Greetings. Yesterday, reverend father, I wrote so suddenly that I did not have the opportunity to reread it; therefore, I doubt whether everything is in the order in which it can be understood. So, briefly: The envoy of Philipp has returned.</p>
      <p>He proposed many things; but in the senate's assembly, not a few were taken away. Not much was done about it, much was improved, so that it would not be so unbearable if it remained as it is.</p>
      <p>But one thing troubles me: that they allow the soldiers to protect and defend the Duchy of Milan; for I fear it will not remain so, because there are many who are for sale and want to wage war by force; indeed, even if Philippus released our people from the same articles (which you may wonder at), it would not be convenient for many, and it is surprising how Hercules from Salicibus is involved in this, who, in the name of the envoy, urges the matter. He wants to take revenge on the Venetians.</p>
      <p>You know the reason.</p>
      <p>The envoy has sent back the proposed articles.</p>
      <p>They will make another attempt.</p>
      <p>I ask you to inform us more accurately about German affairs, so that we have more material to encourage our people to be vigilant. You advise that our people should look to yours.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the reason I mentioned stands in the way.</p>
      <p>Our people are indignant about it, because they believe that they have already been dealt with in bad faith. Meanwhile, the envoy of Philippus proposed the matter in such a way that he wanted to persuade our people that the Swiss would agree to the same.</p>
      <p>And it is truly a great thing that they do not want to know about it, even though they must and should give an answer to both parties about the proposed means at the assembly in Baden, as the decision also requires, and a large sum of money was spent on Philippus' embassy in Baden, as the Lord of Glarus told me. - And a great promise was made to the envoy of Glarus, that they would also include these things in their decision; but they did not want to. Now the same Bäldius, the same Hässius, and others write, and the Italian copy from Bellinzona was sent to our people. What do you want? It is a hidden affair.</p>
      <p>I would have sent the main points; but I could not copy them so suddenly; ask Glarus.</p>
      <p>Our people are amazed that the envoys in Baden allowed him the passage and granted it to him, yet according to their lords' pleasure, etc.</p>
      <p>I know well what I think, etc.</p>
      <p>I have long known this from Balthasar Heer and have explained enough to our people that it is not yet decided.</p>
      <p>Indeed, they have made our people believe that it is already decided on the part of the Confederates; it only depends on the king whether he wants to accept it or not. But that is not the case, etc.; for the decision requires that the envoys should also bring it back with them. In short: the matter is certain; therefore, be vigilant.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Suddenly.</p>
      <p>The day before the calends of March.</p>
      <p>Nor have I reread this, because the messenger is in a hurry, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours, Fabricius.</p>
      <p>The news about the death of Mr. Andreas Hyperius is very bitter.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and honorable father in Christ.</p>
