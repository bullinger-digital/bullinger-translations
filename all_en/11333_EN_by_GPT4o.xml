      <p>Grace and peace through Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>The most learned men, Jodocus Kilchmeyer, our common brother, will inform you of a certain matter on my behalf, where I seek your advice; for I can only be relieved by your help. You may perhaps wonder why I have decided to leave my own, when previously I interceded with such diligence for them with you, so that your care would provide for pious pastors. I certainly confess that I owe much to my homeland, and as much as it will be in my power, I will not hesitate to spend for its benefit. But in the meantime, no one considers my children, for whom I seek not an inheritance, but a livelihood; for that is a sufficiently ample inheritance if they are properly educated.</p>
      <p>But if death should snatch me away from them, I do not doubt that the Lord will provide for them as for other orphans, but until then my work is required in this matter, so that, therefore, in order to consult with the benevolent, in this division of studies, the bridle imposed on the word, which should have been free, must be borne, and that indeed removed from morals, which nevertheless had to be restrained, so that the utmost license to sin is taken, an evil otherwise intolerable to the truly zealous for Christ. But how can I look upon my children hungry and naked with an even mind? Not that this has happened so far, but when debt has grown so much that faith cannot be kept, what else is to be hoped for? How indeed will I extricate myself from there in the future - with expenses increasing daily with the growing children and no profit coming in the meantime - when previously, with a still lighter family, I was not allowed to shake this off? Therefore, I wish to be advised by you as much as cannot be a detriment to the glory of Christ. For I do not ask that the word of God be ill-spoken of because of me and my livelihood. Nor should you think me so greedy that nothing is enough for my desire, or so prodigal that even much is not sufficient. But the churches among us are not rich, our region being almost entirely exempt from the right of tithes. Under the papacy, priests were magnificently supported by the liberality of offerings; but now, with this net torn apart, and people contributing grudgingly from their own, our situation has been reduced to such straits that it cannot support a larger family, although it might be sufficient for one without children.</p>
      <p>But I alone have a more fruitful offspring, the others not so. I do not write this to disparage my own; for the homeland's piety would scarcely bear to hear another attempting that. But since it is not permissible to be troublesome by asking, nor can domestic poverty endure further connivance, at last, another condition must be sought by me, certainly with a sad mind. For believe me this for certain, when I was already preparing to write, I could not complete it in a continuous series, as shame repeatedly calmed the necessity urging me sharply, and these took turns until necessity overcame shame. Therefore, kindly consider this my impudence and show yourselves such as those who wish to advise me, but let not a scandal be placed on the glory of Christ through me; for I would rather suffer the utmost than that anything of the sort could justly be reproached to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Glarus, July 23, 1539.</p>
      <p>Your Valentin Tschudi.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and of utmost integrity, Leo Jud and Heinrich Bullinger, bishops of Zurich, most esteemed lords and brothers.</p>
