      <p>Peter Huber to Heinrich Bullinger, Greetings.</p>
      <p>I see that I have almost found myself in the same situation as Themistocles once did, most learned Bullinger. When he saw that he had to either take up arms against his own country, which had treated him very well, or make an enemy of the king who had received him honorably in exile, he took a short-lived poison, as Plutarch tells it. The brave hero preferred to die rather than disgracefully tarnish his noble deeds by living out the short remainder of his life. For whatever he did, it would not have been without disgrace. So, given the state of my affairs, it is not easy to say what I consider more beneficial for myself than death. For I am so overwhelmed by debt here, working diligently in letters, with the great hope of a salary established by the Zurich council from the monasteries of Durchgaean, that even if that Aristophanic philosopher wished to free me with his inferior cause, he could not. Either I must dishonorably seek a land warmed by another sun, or expect the perpetual bonds of creditors. This misfortune was thrust upon me by your Zurich council, which now shamefully abandons me as I cry out for its help, while, what is more painful, it sometimes supports and nurtures those much less learned than I to its own detriment. But it is not surprising that idiots and the unlearned do this, when even those who wish to be seen as pillars of study care little for students, no matter how much they protest to the point of hoarseness. This is most evident, Heinrich, because all those who studied the more refined literature there are now bravely starving with me, while in the meantime, Penelope's suitors walk around with well-cared-for skin and are appointed to difficult tasks everywhere. I wrote this to you in passing, free from suspicion, so that you might advise me as I struggle with these difficulties in letters.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Winterthur, on Ascension Day.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
