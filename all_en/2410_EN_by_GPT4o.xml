      <p>S. P. If I had anything beyond what I am sending with these to your lords, I would inform you; but since everything is contained there, I will not repeat it. If only the Emperor, who has so far brandished his armies and thunderbolts, had fought; for in one hour he would have freed the Christians from infinite vexations and ruins. But may the Lord's will be done.</p>
      <p>I would gladly know from you what you have about the Moors; it is certain that he, aided by the Emperor, is renewing his fires, and meanwhile the Emperor writes against him, as if he did not know him. The Pope's legate, as I hear, does not dare to enter Rhaetia; but it is hoped that he will soon come to Chur with Angelo Rizzo, the Emperor's legate to the Swiss, to hide under his shadow and practices. That Angelo wants to renew some chapters and for that reason is coming from Milan, where he already is. You can write to Mr. Vergerio and, if you please, greet him in my words. Farewell, excellent man. From Solothurn, September 30th.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bass[afontaneus].</p>
      <p>To the excellent man and friend, Mr. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned Mr. Doctor Bullinger.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
