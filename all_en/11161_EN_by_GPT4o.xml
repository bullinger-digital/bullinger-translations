    <p xml:id="regest1">After Bucer's last letter [No. 1105], he does not wish to argue further with him and also sees no value in further meetings; he would prefer if Bucer stayed away from the upcoming meeting of the evangelical Swiss cities.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>My venerable Gryn채us, the bearer of this letter has brought a wealth of disputes, as he has brought Bucer's extensive apology. I will say nothing about this now, except that I entrust all judgment to God, the just judge. I will not argue with the man any further, unless the spirit suggests otherwise, nor have I previously argued or written so maliciously as he interprets my writing. I value both my own and public tranquility more than private revenge. Meanwhile, as I have long testified, I do not hate Bucer, nor have I brought any accusations against him either privately or publicly, except in these letters. Therefore, let him be of a calm mind. Furthermore, we will take care of our church, and he should take care of his own. As all his letters contain nothing but "let us meet, a meeting is called, let us confer, let us dispute, let the saints judge," we do not think it necessary to meet every month, nor does it seem so necessary or fruitful. They met in Bern; they disputed for 20 days. They often met in Zurich, often in Basel, and also in Marburg. We met three times in Basel. Is that not enough? We hold the essence of true religion. In this, we will persevere. We will not dispute about it as if it were uncertain every day. Whom have we harmed so far with our sermons or writings? I believe you have read the books written to the King of England. In these, what have I done wrong? What in them could displease the pious and even Luther himself, to whom I sent a copy along with the most friendly letters? I seek concord, not discord. If Bucer comes to the upcoming meeting or convention called only for the Swiss cities, I fear a great contention. Perhaps the matter would be better resolved without him. But let the Lord's will be done. Consider these words as spoken to your heart, my Gryn채us.</p>
      <p>Greet Myconius.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 30, 1538.</p>
      <p>Yours as always from the heart, H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To his dearest Simon Gryn채us, to be delivered by hand. To Mr. Simon Gryn채us.</p>
