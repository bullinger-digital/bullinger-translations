      <p>Greetings. Today at noon we concluded the German synod; everything proceeded very successfully and auspiciously. We took action against some wine-bibbers, of whom 7 were imprisoned; the Lutherans and Bucerans were completely silenced; I hope for great tranquility henceforth. Indeed, a few were caught, with whom we will deal privately; for we did not want to hold any debate or action before the synod that would prolong it. The inquiry and correction were very necessary and, as I hope, most useful; I hope for a more correct doctrine and life from many. The French synod is now approaching; may it proceed with the same ease as the German one.</p>
      <p>The lords have donated 10 pounds to each class or chapter. You have the summary. I cannot say more; for the brothers are distracting me. You would have certainly seen the excellent assembly of ministers and certainly among many grandsons, yet many Christian, pious, and learned men. Farewell. Musculus greets you and yours, as does my entire family. Tomorrow, the matter of Lord Musculus will be discussed and concluded. March 15th, Bern.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most outstanding theologian and the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his dearest lord and compatriot. M. Heinrich Bullinger. Zürich.</p>
