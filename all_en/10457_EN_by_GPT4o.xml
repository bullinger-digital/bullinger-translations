    <p xml:id="regest1">Rejoices over the spread of the evangelical faith. Who would not feel that God is granting His grace to the churches in Swabia? It is pious not to cling unyieldingly to an opinion once formed, but to change it when it is surpassed by better understanding. In Zurich, things are undoubtedly satisfactory thanks to Bullinger's vigilance. The good leader manages to ensure that others follow him in goodness. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God.</p>
      <p>The Roman consul once wrote in a certain speech against Catiline that the days on which we are preserved are no less joyful and illustrious than those on which we are born, because the certainty of salvation is a sure thing, while the condition of birth is uncertain, and because we are born without sensation, but are certainly preserved with pleasure. However, I take a very different view: The most solid joy will arise among all the faithful when they see the evangelical torch not only shining upon us and dispelling the Roman darkness, but also being nurtured and preserved by the Lord, so that on that day the Lord alone holds the reins of the kingdom and all nations flow to Him, with superstition eliminated and images shattered, they worship the one and only and, liberated by the preaching of the divine word, spend the rest of their lives in holiness and righteousness with the Redeemer. Indeed, I must confess to you, my teacher, the ineffable joy that the epigram from Neuenburg on the death of the mass has brought us. Who would be so dull as not to feel the gift of the divine spirit spread and communicated to the Swabian churches? Even if that quibbler crows, resists with fists and heels, and is greatly proud. Meanwhile, that best and heavenly Father never fails His own, arranging instruments to build up the most sacred tabernacle occupied by pontifical tunnels and torn apart by the machines of the most impious! Indeed, they reason piously according to the example of the most excellent bishops of the church recently gathered from the nations after Christ's ascension, that it is not necessary to cling with all zeal and effort to something once seen in the mind, but rather to change one's opinion when a better and more correct one prevails. You certainly perceive it to be the work of the Lord. With Him objecting, the matter rises more fervently among the faithful. With this one being foolish, the truth itself, which rejoices in nakedness, breaks through more and more into the corners of Germany. What shall I say? While he strives to wallow like a muddy pig with anyone, almost all the leaders of Germany give the palm to the word of God rather than to human dreams. Yet I would prefer that Christian tranquility be restored to its former splendor and that, as it is written, each one seeks to abound for the edification of the church. For contentions are most evil when they blaze.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I now come to our matters. The master has explained the state of our republic, undoubtedly still quite intact through your great efforts and vigilance. And may the inconveniences, which we perceive with infallible forebodings to be at the door, be alleviated by the best and greatest God through the remedies of wise counsels! Indeed, it must be admitted that for the most sincere republic to be built, the city must be well-mannered. For he who provides a good leader causes others to follow well. Again, a fish first stinks from the head, and the rest of the populace is infected by the contagion of the leaders. I am not unaware that you are striving earnestly for these things. May God grant that His rule be extended without deceit, that idols yield to His glorious name, and that we follow the author of salvation with blameless life and innocence of morals!</p>
      <p>Farewell with favorable omens. We wish your wife and your entire family to be well. Greet the lord provost, your neighbor and my relative and patron, in my words, and you will always have him commended to you.</p>
      <p>From Kappel, August 4.</p>
      <p>Johannes Liberianus, always devoted to you with all my heart and all my spirit.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and upright Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church in Zurich, dearest teacher.</p>
