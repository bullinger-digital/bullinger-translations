      <p>Greetings. I have received everything you sent, dearest brother, and I hope you have already received the same in part, which you sent to me. What friends have sent in the meantime, you have enclosed here, which I send to you as they were sent to me. Believe as much as you wish.</p>
      <p>I cannot write more, being so overwhelmed with business. Therefore, forgive me and farewell forever. Zurich, January 5, 1569.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet the honorable consuls, Mr. Karl, Pontasella, Ganthner, and other brothers and friends.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, minister of the church in Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
