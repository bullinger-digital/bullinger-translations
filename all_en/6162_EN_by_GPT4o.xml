      <p>My humble, willing service, obedience, and whatever I can love and do good, I offer to you always, honorable lord and father. Your letter, addressed to Josua, my son, he has read to me in this hour in secret and confidence, having also understood the same from you as from your faithful, careful, and prudent service to the common peace. Therefore, we are of the intention to act upon your letter as a marriageable matter in the most advantageous and diligent manner; especially since today we are expecting the lord treasurer and other honorable people from Appenzell at a wedding of his relatives, and if he or other trusted ones appear, it would be convenient to speak with them orally as needed. However, if they do not appear, we have our counsel on how we intend to bring this matter to its place without delay, and we are also ready to inform Lord Walther Clarer in writing, so that he may obtain support from the council, which, when the need arises, we hope, as he is a countryman and well-regarded, will turn out well. This I have wanted to let you know at your request, since Josua must now be in the seated council due to his office and cannot otherwise dispatch the messenger.</p>
      <p>Thus, I wish to make amends for this small matter. May the almighty and merciful God assist such a contentious matter to the praise of His name, to peace and Christian unity and welfare of our common fatherland according to His grace. My son and I send you our greetings.</p>
      <p>We also wish to send friendly greetings to the lords and brothers. We will faithfully deliver your greetings to the lords and brothers.</p>
      <p>We leave you always in our care.</p>
      <p>We must wait to see where the troops, gathered around Rankweil and Bregenz with daily reinforcements, intend to go.</p>
      <p>May God thwart all evil schemes.</p>
      <p>It is not to be underestimated and will require care and attention according to the circumstances of the times. Given on June 6th, St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>Johannes Kessler, your ever willing. To the honorable, highly and well-learned lord M. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful servant of the Lord's word in the city of Zurich, my especially gracious and dear lord.</p>
