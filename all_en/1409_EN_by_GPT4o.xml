      <p>S. I am sending 50 copies of Mr. Vergerius's books and will send more later; I could not burden the current messenger with more. If Vergerius is there, tell him that I have already distributed most of the copies; I have dispersed many to Geneva, Lausanne, Basel, and throughout our region. You will give him these letters written by Viret. Heldius also came yesterday; Mecardus and Ehingerus have set off for Basel; Dachserus will go to Biel.</p>
      <p>We must ensure that we provide for the good brothers, and you will also join us in this effort.</p>
      <p>As far as the day is concerned, my lords are very dissatisfied that it was scheduled so hastily, at such an inconvenient time, when we are busy with the harvest, and especially without any indication of a reason, which has never been done before. Therefore, as far as I understand (although I have asked that we should act like other Confederates, so that it is not said again that we are the most arrogant), the day will not be attended unless a reason and cause are given in advance, so that we know how to prepare and consider it.</p>
      <p>These things from Hagius and the chief scribe, with whom I have spoken about this. There are few of the other senators in the city, I think barely five or six, as they are all now occupied with the grape harvest; for we have a great yield of wine, praise be to the Lord. However, I cannot yet know for sure what will happen.</p>
      <p>Regarding Schwyz, I am curious about what they have to say at Rüti.</p>
      <p>Concerning the council, Knight Franck (a disreputable man; so say those who know him and have dealt with him) is waiting for an answer. If my lords remain with the plan they presented to the 7 places years ago through envoys, they will also tell the cantons that since they can do it, they should now also do it in God's name and leave them in peace. And that is also the reason why they have declined the day in Zurich.</p>
      <p>Regarding the monasteries, the Knights of St. John have often urged my lords, but have not yet achieved anything. Against the Confederates, nothing is better than bravery; if they see that we allow ourselves to be frightened, then they are first helped.</p>
      <p>Regarding the preachers, about whom you are concerned that something will be brought up on the day, the situation is as follows: In the County of Neuchâtel, at St. Blaise, there is a preacher who is said to have preached that all who are not of our faith or who deviate from it are worse than the thief before God, who was hanged on those days. Some of the bad priests from the cantons, who are still papist, heard this and reported it to those from Solothurn; they, along with those from the cantons, have justified the preacher in Neuchâtel for such words. But as the matter did not go according to their liking, those from Solothurn pushed it to the remaining 6 places, and thus the 7 places sent an envoy to Neuchâtel; what they achieved, I cannot know. Nevertheless, the day was scheduled for this reason. That is the matter. How the words of the sermon went, I cannot know otherwise than as I have heard. They will, however, try to push a barrier against us. I am concerned that the printing will also be affected; for our Freiburgers are very vehemently mocking against it. But nothing other than action, and yet discreetly, is best. If they are tired, it is all the worse for them.</p>
      <p>The matter of Maurice has been peacefully resolved, although it started high; praise be to God! Musculus is very troubled about Augsburg, as the church is going to ruin.</p>
      <p>If Vergerius is there, remind him to take his leave at the points and, if possible, to acknowledge his insecurity.</p>
      <p>The Frenchman is said to have recently taken 4 cities from the Emperor in Piedmont, and also to have made an incursion in Spain with his fleet near Barcelona and taken away many people. Persecution is starting again in France as strongly as ever. At Karlstadt, the Bishop of Würzburg is said to have found 48 believers and had six of them executed, banishing the rest from the land.</p>
      <p>This is what I have for now. You will take good care of everything and greet your family along with the brothers who are there, from me and mine; Musculus sends his regards to you. Bern, September 19, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his lord and esteemed compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
