      <p> I am sending you the letters, most reverend father, one of which was left at home last week due to the merchants' partial lack of resources and partly due to the quicker departure than expected. I am enclosing the others and informing you that your last letters sent to Mr. Campello have been taken care of in good faith. We have understood the difficulty of the printer regarding Mr. Lentulus's book, which we have received, and the Sculian prodigy. Perhaps Mr. Lentulus will send his book to Geneva or give it to be printed in Puschlav. As for the prodigy, I know that its description is not of such importance that it deserves to see the light. </p>
      <p> However, I give you, most prudent father, the authority to do with it whatever you wish. But if it is decided so, whatever it is, I would prefer to send the centos to Basel, only my poems in both languages to be printed with the picture of this prodigy. The reasons that move me are these: that I dedicated this to our Mr. Erni, not to anyone else, that the number of rhymes is more than enough, lengthy and unpleasant and inconvenient for the printers, especially if they were to be condensed into one page, add to that, neither of us, when we wrote these, thought anything about the types. My Mr. Campellus read it first, whom I later asked to add only ten or twelve in the Engadine idiom; but he, growing into such a multitude, increased the number of mine, which was already quite lengthy. </p>
      <p> Therefore, with good permission, they can be omitted. Henceforth, I would like to ask you, most esteemed father, that this example, which I am sending to you, be sent to Basel to be printed, not first attached to the prodigious picture nor even the one I recently sent to Mr. Gwalther, when I wrote to him for another reason. I had two corrected copies; but the one I wanted to send then, I retained at home due to some haste and now I am sending it to you. The other, which I wanted to keep at home, I sent to Mr. Gwalther; which I would like to be returned to me. Therefore, this one, which I am now sending, may be published by me, which I would like you to remind Mr. Müller, if you write to him. The rest at another time. </p>
      <p> All of ours send you their most dutiful greetings. I will write to Mr. Haller soon, whom you should greet most dutifully. 1573, October 9. </p>
      <p> Your most devoted Tobias Egli. If you can, amidst your duties, please read this example; for I have changed many places, and unless it seems too harsh, send it. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most renowned and foremost Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his singularly esteemed lord. </p>
