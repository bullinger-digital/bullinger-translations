      <p>Greetings from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. I am still staying in Chiavenna due to the great commotion that the gospel has stirred up in the Valtellina (as I wrote). The matter is not yet completely settled; but in two days it will be settled to the great glory of Christ.</p>
      <p>I will leave here around the 15th of April and come directly to you, my dear Bullinger; which I would like you to affirm clearly to all the brothers, especially to Ziegler, to whom Bellinchetus, who was with me today, sends many greetings, and especially to you. Farewell and be well with your whole family, school, and church. In Italy, the gospel and persecution are fervent.</p>
      <p>Chiavenna, 26th of March.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To Bullinger.</p>
