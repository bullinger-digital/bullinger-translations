    <p xml:id="regest1">Wolfgang [Huber] has delivered the money and the letter. Michael Farner, who apparently has not yet been lawfully installed [in his parish office] and expects the city pastors to initiate this, should himself - as the others have done so far - inquire with the mayor about the representative of the authorities who will introduce him to the congregation, and also appoint the dean. Bullinger has collected a pound for Wolfgang [Meyer's] dress; will let Stumpf know how much more money is collected. Will negotiate with the caretaker. There is no urgency regarding the document from the papal procession. Has paid three and a half shillings for the booklet. Greetings.</p>

      <p>To his Stumpf.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from God through our Lord Jesus. Mr. Wolf has delivered money and a letter to me, namely 1 pound 10 shillings. From the letter, I understand that Mr. Michael Farner has not yet been installed, as is the custom and law, and that you are placing the burden on us, who preach here, etc. However, you should know that it has never been our practice, nor has it ever been expected of us, to run around and summon those who, as is the apostolic custom, carry out such tasks. Thus, the elected and appointed pastors have done: When they were appointed to a parish, they went to the mayor and requested that someone be appointed at their expense to introduce them to the congregation. Then the city scribe wrote to the appointed city official, the bailiff, or whoever was instructed, and so the pastor also appointed the dean accordingly. Therefore, Mr. Michael should do as others do, and I think it will go for him as it does for others. So he should speak up and work on it. Therefore, let him come here and hear the decision of the mayor.</p>
      <p>Regarding Brother Wolf's dress, I have collected one pound, and I hope more will be collected; however, I will let you know the response I receive. If you collect more, it will be well used. The sum is not small either.</p>
      <p>Regarding the caretaker, I will act according to your instructions as best as I can.</p>
      <p>I can wait for the letter written in the papal procession, and it is not urgent.</p>
      <p>For the booklet, I have paid 3 1/2 shillings on your behalf. May God protect you.</p>
      <p>Monday after St. Nicholas 1539.</p>
      <p>I wish safety for your family.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
