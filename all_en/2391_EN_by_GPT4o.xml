      <p>S. This message comes from the people of Lucerne. I understand well that it grieves my lords that Zürich, Basel, and Schaffhausen have withdrawn from the legal agreement and the decision made in Aarau, and have agreed to annul the contract made by Tschudi and the one from Appenzell; for they believe that the good people will be harmed by this, as they are to be punished according to the peace of the land. It has been decided that they will not agree to the contract and will not proceed with the legal agreement, as the three cities have withdrawn from it, but will leave it as it is and not send any messengers there on the appointed day.</p>
      <p>However, if the three cities or at least Zürich remain with the decision made in Aarau, then my lords will proceed with them and see how they might be better helped. I write this to you to see if it is possible (if it would be better) not to agree to any bad contract, or if they cannot be better helped, that they do not separate from each other. Do the best.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I have nothing to write at the moment, except that it is written from Augsburg that Pangratius Mätteli was beheaded there on August 25th for a certain dishonorable murder committed and for some other reasons.</p>
      <p>Viretus and Beza were here these days, working to obtain excommunication; but they were dismissed without success. All of ours greet you, especially Musculus and his family.</p>
      <p>Greet yours also in the name of all of us. Farewell. Bern, September 16, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord and compatriot, to be honored with perpetual faith.</p>
      <p>Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
