      <p>Greetings. Your letter, dear brother, has made me, already troubled for many reasons, even more sorrowful. I urge you, however, to diligently commend yourself to the grace of God and implore His help, for He cannot be absent or fail those who call upon Him. He once saved His own among lions and in the midst of a burning furnace; the same today, if He wills, can save from the contagion of the plague. But if the Lord calls us from here through diseases, He will call us into His kingdom and deliver us from this collapsing and perishing world. Oh, how fortunate we are! We shall see Him as He is, and what we have hoped for, we shall achieve. He will care for our descendants and children, who is the Father of widows and orphans. Therefore, be strong in the Lord and perform your duty cheerfully and faithfully.</p>
      <p>That matter of the envoy greatly displeases me. If he was made a knight by the Pope, if he received such gifts, indeed, if there are still good and strong men left, they will act as befits them and as the safety of the country and religion requires. But if these things are certain and they remain silent about everything, there is no reason to complain if they are soon to perish. God's judgments are just. But what can you do here? Prudently advise the faithful, pray diligently, and commit the cause to the Lord. However, what I have thought for several years that those peacocks would do, I now fear more and more they will do, based on what they have done in the Engadin. They have those who instruct them, the Pope and the Emser; they also have money and luxury. They seek the way. Thus, our dissensions, ingratitude, and most corrupt life will be punished as they deserve; and those will be punished too, etc. When you learn something certain about the collection, inform me. I also have little hope and pray that you act wisely; I could not refuse Dathenus when he asked for this.</p>
      <p>Also write what response has been given by the communities in the matter of the Cellarius. I am grieved for Saliceus being granted the cardinal's hat, in his name and for the Rhaetians; the cardinal's hat has never done well, it is red with blood, etc. We are expecting at any moment to hear news from Belgium, where both armies have long been prepared for conflict.</p>
      <p>May the Lord have mercy on us! Amidst many tasks, I write this hastily. May the Lord Jesus keep you and your family and bless you! Greet our friends by name, whom you know. August 6, 1568.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
