      <p>S. These days, Mr. Beza wrote to me and also sent a certain document, which he claims to have received from you, as if written in the name of the French churches to the German ones, in which they profess to concede to the form of the Augsburg Confession.</p>
      <p>This document greatly disturbed both the people of Geneva and ours; for the Senate of Geneva also wrote about it to our Senate, and we were about to send you a copy, had we not understood from Beza's letters that it had already been sent to you before.</p>
      <p>But who, I ask, is that evil spirit who insinuates himself so cunningly? Beza testifies and solemnly affirms that the French churches have hitherto been unaware of this document, although he admits in the meantime that there are not a few who are attempting to hinder the progress of the gospel under the pretext of that Augsburg Confession. I wonder if the spirit of Sulzer is not showing itself here, who in every way seeks to be another Bucer, who many still remember for the harm he brought to our churches and others as well by his concord.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we must be vigilant against such people.</p>
      <p>If you are certain about the authors, please inform us.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, I have nothing now except about Viret, for whose sake our people sent a certain nobleman from Erlach to the king, so that he might remain in Lyon; but he brought back a brief response from the king and queen that the king wishes to uphold the edict, meanwhile advising our people to do what they want in their own regions and to allow him to rule his own as he sees fit.</p>
      <p>Thus, Viret remains outside Lyon in Provence. The adversaries seem to think that by expelling him, they have overthrown that entire church.</p>
      <p>They expelled him, who contains the king's edict, that no foreigner should preach in France; yet they consider him a foreigner, who was born among us. By this pretext, they managed to expel him from there.</p>
      <p>Our people and many others are still working for his restoration; but what they will achieve, I do not know. We hear that those churches are in great danger and that public fasts have been proclaimed throughout them.</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve them; for our safety is also connected with theirs. There are also some reports of tumults arising in Scotland; but since I do not doubt that you have more certain information from there, there is no need for me to write much about these. Bernhard Lavater is returning to you again.</p>
      <p>How he parted from his master and what we have done in his case, I write to Mr. Lavater, your son-in-law, his brother, so that it is not necessary for me to trouble you with it. Farewell.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you, especially Steiger, Diesbach, Grafenried, MÃ¼linen, and my father-in-law, mother, wife, and entire family. Greet yours from me as well.</p>
      <p>Steiger sends you some cheeses again and asks that you kindly accept them. Bern, November 16, 1565.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>After I wrote this, your letters dated November 1st were finally delivered to me, in which this document was enclosed, which I also enclose here and thank you. The rest require no response; therefore, farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
