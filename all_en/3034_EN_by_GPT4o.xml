      <p>Many greetings, most distinguished man, to you with that much more interest, because in your letters, which you often send through Beldio, you have the habit of greeting me first. From this fact, I can indeed infer that you have not placed me last among your friends. Would that God someday provide me the opportunity to repay your benefits, which you have bestowed upon me most abundantly.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I do not think it escapes your notice that Balthasar Herus, when he was on a diplomatic mission, met with you on his return on behalf of the pastor, in my name; for the church of Betschwanden, located in our region, has long been without one.</p>
      <p>You mentioned two people, both worthy, to whom the church's trust can be safely committed; you named one as Elias of Werdenberg, the other you said is acting as a minister of the word in the Johanniter Valley. Therefore, if it could be done, the parish of the aforementioned church would prefer to have this one given to them as a pastor, who is now residing in the Johanniter Valley, because they have already approached him several times, to whom he also promised his arrival, if the command of his lords among the people of Zürich or at least his own obedience, to which he is bound to the Zürich magistrate, remained unharmed. For this reason, I earnestly ask you, if possible, that through your persuasion and promotion, we may obtain the presence and arrival of this man. You are of great authority among the pious; therefore, your efforts in the business of Christ are very valuable. What I write, I write by the commission of the aforementioned church of Betschwanden, which always commends itself to you as a faithful minister of Christ.</p>
      <p>Farewell to Nestor's years with your honorable family and as happily as possible, amen.</p>
      <p>Given in Glarus on the 12th day of October.</p>
      <p>Fridolin Brunner, minister of the word among the people of Glarus, most observant of you.</p>
      <p>If your affairs do not prevent it, make sure to inform me of your mind this week; for upon receiving your letters, we will summon him as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and most outstanding man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor among the people of Zürich, his esteemed and dear lord.</p>
