      <p>Greetings. I have received your letters, for which I give you the greatest thanks. These followers of the Emperor boast of their victories in Italy in astonishing ways and completely spare the truth; let them also hear what has happened in Picardy. But I will remain silent about all of that; for from what I write to the lords, you will understand enough, etc. Truly, the practices of this Bullinger are remarkable, but the purse is empty. There is no doubt about the English marriage, to which, however, all of England silently opposes, and it cannot be that this Spaniard will remain hidden there for long. The Emperor was calling the Duke of Brunswick to him, but he was delayed by the princes of the Rhenish League, who are now in Worms, or rather due to a lack of funds; for the Emperor was only giving words, and these German soldiers know their own arts. I greet Lord Consul Habius and you uniquely.</p>
      <p>Farewell. From Solothurn hastily, August 24.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Basse-Fontaine.</p>
