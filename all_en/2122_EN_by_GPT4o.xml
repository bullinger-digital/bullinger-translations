      <p>S. The messenger from Zurich, most kind sir, came to me on December 16th, and on the same day around 12 o'clock, he departed again. I handed him the letters sent by Mr. Gwalther and you, Mr. Simpert, addressed to Mr. Vergerius. He is certainly satisfied with my handling of his affairs, which will make me more willing in the future, and he indicates that more letters will be sent to me by you. I will always understand from your letters how important it is to either send them immediately or wait for messengers who might present themselves by chance. The good man, as I gather from the notary, fears excessive expenses; hence, he did not pay the messenger as much as he should have, indicating that he finally left Zurich on December 16th, although, as I said above, he reached and left Schaffhausen again on that day, which you will undoubtedly inform him of in your next letters; and I have decided to do the same.</p>
      <p>The notary from Geneva left on December 16th and reached us on the 14th. Here you have our response written down. For our most honorable council selected three from the senatorial order, namely Bovillus, Pflumius, and Rinckius the noble, and likewise three from the ministers, Mr. Simpert, Grübel, and myself. They further decreed that the response given by us should be valid and not presented to the council. It is as follows:</p>
      <p>The order they have in their church with the ban or exclusion we consider Christian and divine, as Christ gave such a clear command to his holy apostles that they should break it and thus to all churches, as we have in Matthew 5:18 and 1 Corinthians 5. Therefore, they should remain by such a Christian order and custom, letting no one be driven away from it in any way, so that the exclusion and subsequent grace, according to the old apostolic custom, belong to the consistory, and not to the other regular authorities who have their special authority and laws to punish vices with action. And as we have understood this, we have accepted their explanation. As for our custom, which we have maintained in our churches until now, we do not want to hide from you that we punish open vices such as adultery, fornication, blasphemy, theft, etc., in another way, and especially for adultery and fornication, some, and for the other open vices also other disciplinarians are appointed who punish such and similar vices rigorously on our command. And when we want to hold the Lord's Supper, the ministers of the word admonish the people that no one should go there who is involved in open vices. Although our custom of the ban is not entirely similar to yours, we cannot reject your Christian and scripturally measured custom, but praise and commend it highly. And if we had adopted such a custom or God grants that we might still adopt it according to the opportunity of the time and our people, may God then help us, we would remain by it as far as it is useful.</p>
      <p>We have not wanted to withhold from you, as our dear friends and neighbors, your friendly request, etc.</p>
      <p>They also promise their effort and advice in other matters, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I ask you, most excellent sir, to share with me the document or response given by the Bernese to the Genevans in the Servetus case. For I have no doubt that you have also received it from Mr. Haller. Then the same response given to the Baselers in this case of excommunication.</p>
      <p>I will return them shortly and in good faith. The reason I ask so confidently is your humanity and utmost benevolence towards me, which you have exercised so far, by which you bind me and other fellow ministers to you so that we owe you ourselves and all that we can. Farewell and live well, most kind sir, with all the pious and learned fellow ministers whom you will greet in my name. I ask you to write about any news from England or elsewhere that you have. Our fellow ministers greet you.</p>
      <p>We have no news except that Albert was defeated by the Nurembergers and barely escaped from the battle. Schaffhausen, December 23, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours most devoted to your humanity, Jakob Rüeger, minister of the church in Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent in learning and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed lord and brother in Christ.</p>
