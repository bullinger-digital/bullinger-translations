      <p>Strasbourg, 12th December 1549.</p>
      <p>Greetings and peace through our Lord Jesus Christ! The remarkable kindness you showed me while I was in Zurich does not allow me to forget my promise, even amidst the greatest turmoil of affairs. My dearest Bullinger, you wished that I would write more often; which I now begin to do, although there is hardly any material left to write about. Whatever can be heard from England, you will surely hear from the letters of our beloved Richard Hilles, and I have not received any news, except that a certain Paget, a man good in every way, has been appointed President of Wales. What Wales is, who Paget is, Butler and Hales will inform you. Everything else remains as it was in status and order since the capture of the Protector, about whom not a word is yet written, except that he is detained in prison. Everything is uncertain about the Emperor's arrival to us, nor is it believed that he will come before spring. The priests and the bishop are striving to have the mass restored to us on Christmas Day; what will happen, we shall see.</p>
      <p>May our Lord Jesus Christ, for the sake of mercy, keep us unharmed from all error, amen. I have eternal thanks for you and your wife for your kindnesses to me, to whom you will convey greetings in my and my wife's name. The letters enclosed here, I beg you to send through reliable couriers, one to Aarau, the other to Constance. There is a certain honorable woman whose husband has served a widow in Constance for a year; he promised to come here for Christmas and has now written the opposite; the wife writes back and wishes that they be delivered safely and surely, and as quickly as possible. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Your Burcher, the Englishman.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher, my gracious lord and dear friend. Zurich.</p>
