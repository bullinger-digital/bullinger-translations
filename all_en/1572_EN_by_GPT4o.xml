      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you recently that Calvin was contemplating a visit to us. Meanwhile, while I was advising against it and awaiting your counsel, behold, he has arrived. He came here on February 17th.</p>
      <p>The reason for his hastened journey to us was the captivity of a certain minister from the Geneva countryside, who was captured by one of our local officials by order of our senate and thrown into chains, because it was reported that he had said in a public sermon that all those who partake in the sacrament of the Lord's body on Christmas Day are not eating Christ but Satan himself. This greatly offended our people. Therefore, Calvin came to excuse him. And indeed, if the matter is as Calvin explains, he spoke much more mildly, and he is being treated with considerable injustice. However, our people do not wish to deal with the Genevans on this matter. Furthermore, he requested a meeting with us, which was granted to him. He proposed various things, but primarily he recounted the entire story of Jerome, showing what and how things were done with him, warning us to beware of his tricks and to look out for our churches in time.</p>
      <p>He is greatly embittered against this man, as you will see from the book on predestination that he has now published in Geneva, the beginning of which he brought to us. He then complained that he is publicly slandered by many ministers of our domain: he requested that if we care for concord, we should dissuade such people from these kinds of calumnies: he requested that all animosities and suspicions between us cease: that he sincerely loves us, and asks that we be similarly disposed towards him, etc. These were almost the sum of what he proposed. He was heard calmly, and he was also calmly answered to everything, that it is not up to us to prevent sincere concord from being cultivated. Let him continue as he has begun, and we will also embrace him, etc. Privately, he conferred with me whether it would be possible for us to testify about his doctrine before the senate. I neither wanted to deny nor affirm anything on behalf of the other brothers. However, I showed him some difficulties that might perhaps hinder this effort of his. Therefore, he made no mention of this matter in the meeting. After he had been here for three days, he departed with everyone's good will. We received and treated him as kindly as we could. Only Jodocus neither wanted to hear him nor to participate in the meeting or banquet where we received him. This gravely offended him, but I excused the man's manners to him as much as I could. I spoke with him about the council, so that he might prepare an antidote for the following sessions. And he seemed to agree to this request. He did not have those two sessions before I sent him the ones I received from you. The King of England sent him a booklet written in his own hand, which he highly commends. Otherwise, there is nothing new with us, except that it is reported about Schertlin that he is recruiting soldiers in Basel, and that there is a great preparation for war everywhere.</p>
      <p>The Burgundians are strengthening their borders towards us with garrisons. A certain Württembergian, who was with his prince's envoys in Trent, writes to Musculus that those envoys were not heard by the council, but were forced to hide there and to disguise their journey. Behold, therefore, what would happen to us if we were to go there? He also writes that Maurice is protesting against the council and its judges and is trying to rescind everything that has been done so far. But I also await from you what you have. I return to you the monk's story and give thanks. Please write what you have done with Froschauer, and that he should send copies. A certain citizen of ours, Hans Keck, known to Balthasar the bookseller, has gone there; he will receive whatever pertains to me. Farewell. Musculus and the others greet you. Give many greetings from me and mine to all of yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
