    <p xml:id="regest1">They express gratitude for the zeal of the people of Zurich in promoting concord with the Lutherans. Nevertheless, they cannot sign the Zurich Confession of the Lord's Supper [No. 482] sent to them due to some ambiguities; their church is accustomed to speaking differently. They make use of the offer for free criticism and express concerns about formulations that emphasize the presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper more strongly than is possible based on the symbolic doctrine of the Lord's Supper represented by the Swiss churches of Zwingli. In the Lord's Supper, we testify that we have already, in faith, received the body of Christ to eat and his blood to drink. They summarize the doctrine of the Lord's Supper represented by the Bernese church in a short confession and refer to Zwingli's "Confessio ad principes Germaniae" [1530]. However, their confession is not to be published; they only want to make their simple understanding of the Lord's Supper known to the people of Zurich. They are admonished not to harm the church and the truth - even through new discord within the reformed camp - for the sake of a hoped-for peace with the Lutherans.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>We give you the thanks we can, dear brothers and fellow laborers in Christ, for your great efforts towards concord between the Lutherans and us. For we also strive, as much as we can, to have peace and concord with all people, with the glory of God and His truth preserved. However, we must be very careful that a poorly constructed concord does not sow the seeds of much greater discord, not only between the Lutherans and us but also among our churches. Indeed, without causing great offense to our church, we can hardly subscribe to your confession in all respects, as it is not accustomed to such expressions. Moreover, it does not seem safe to do this without consulting our magistrate, who is not only a part of the church but also its patron, as the care of the churches is entrusted to him.</p>
      <p>Since you, our dearest brothers, have given us the opportunity to advise you if anything in your confession is less circumspect or ill-considered, we will do this not only for that reason but also because we recognize each other as brothers, and it is the duty of brothers to mutually advise and present mutual dangers before each other's eyes. We have no doubt that you will consider everything in good faith. Therefore, the things in your confession that displease us and seem less circumspect - which we say with the peace of all of you in mind - are as follows: First, we agree with you when you assert in your confession that the true body of Christ is truly present in the supper of the faithful. For we have taught our churches this from the word of God until now. However, when you add that the same body is given and distributed there, either we do not understand you, or you have confessed more than enough. Nor is it sufficient to object: Nevertheless, we have explained ourselves. For regarding the presence of the body of Christ, you have explained enough, and we do not disapprove of it. But what you conclude at the end, you have left unexplained when you say: "We therefore believe that the true body of the Lord is in the supper," etc., "in the meantime, in the manner and by the means by which the Lord presents Himself to His own, by which He distributes Himself to His own." In this, you seem to assert that Christ presents Himself first through the administration of the symbols, who, however, was already presented, distributed, and received in the hearts of the elect through faith and the Spirit. But what you add immediately about Christ giving and distributing Himself to us, you seem to refer again to the supper, when this must have already happened before. Otherwise, it cannot be called the supper of Christ and the faithful. Hence, it seems a harsher statement that Christ, our high priest, by His power here - here, I say, in the supper - does this very thing.</p>
      <p>Then you say that Christ exposes and declares Himself to us, in what way He distributes Himself in the supper - for you affirm that He is given and distributed there - citing John 6:51: "The bread that I will give," etc. It seems to us that these do not apply here, but as we have said, it must happen before the supper. This is what Zwingli once proved with many and most certain arguments in our dispute against Benedict Burgouwer. The following: "He gives this bread to be eaten" up to this: "are distributed and eaten in the symbols," etc., we confess with you and have already confessed. But they seem to do little or nothing to explain or prove your confession. When it follows: "They are distributed and eaten, even when they are eaten in the symbols," if you refer it to what has already been said, there is nothing absurd, but if to the eating of the sacraments, as your confession holds, namely truly and not only symbolically, we would like it to be proven.</p>
      <p>Then when you explain about the symbols, this is what we do not understand, namely that the church is made certain and undoubted by the symbols, that the body of Christ was given and broken for us, etc. This neither the external preaching of the word nor the administration of the symbols nor anything external can do, but only the power, operation, and efficacy of the Spirit of God confer this certainty to the elect. However, what we think about the symbols, we will confess shortly. When it finally follows: "As I offer you the bread to be eaten with the mouth of the body," etc., since you are still dealing with the explanation of the symbols and assert that this is done by the administration and offering of the symbols, we have said a little before: We testify that the body has already been eaten by faith and the blood drunk by the eating of bread and the drinking of wine. Otherwise, we would not have approached as faithful, but rather we would be made faithful in the supper for the first time. But what you add immediately, "I indicate the fruit," seems much milder and almost contradictory to the word of giving.</p>
      <p>These are, dearest brothers, the things in your confession that seem to us more obscure than that they can be accepted by our church, and about which we have judged you should be admonished out of charity, earnestly asking that you receive everything in the spirit in which it was done, plainly fraternal and most sincere. For either we do not understand your summary, or what we write is true.</p>
      <p>Thus, we briefly inform you how our church is taught in this matter: We and our church believe that Christ is truly present in the supper of the faithful, yet not naturally united to the bread and distributed with the taken bread, but sacramentally and mystically presented to the faithful and renewed mind. The sacraments are signs, testimonies, and memorials of the grace bestowed through Christ's death, and as you also feel, they not only signify but in a certain way present to the senses and represent the divine promises and free benefits of God, and because of the analogy of the things of which they are symbols, they receive names, excite faith, exercise it, testify, and invite to charity. In summary: Whatever Zwingli confessed in the Confession to the Princes of Germany and in many other writings about this matter, we also confess, not because we have sworn to the words of a man, but because we recognize the truth simply taught and asserted by him.</p>
      <p>We do not send you our confession in this matter because we wish it to be published or printed by anyone, which would never be allowed to us without the knowledge of our magistrate, but so that you may know the simplicity we use in proposing this matter to our churches. For the speech of truth should be simple and open. We wish that in this tragedy to be composed with the Lutherans, not only we but also the truth, our churches, and posterity may be consulted, lest they be endangered - for you are not unaware of what the opinions of the fathers of Augsburg about the Eucharist have contributed to our age, however they have explained themselves. For relying on these more than on simple scripture, the papacy has imposed this error about the Eucharist on the world. Therefore, we wish you, our dearest brothers, who first spread this truth in the world through our Zwingli, to be admonished and requested to act with your singular prudence, having thoroughly considered the matter, so that while you think peace is to be hoped for from the Lutherans, you do not stir up a new tragedy for us.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, dearest brothers, and as you are accustomed, consider our small matters favorably.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 16, 1534.</p>
      <p>The brothers and ministers of the church of Bern.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, Leo Jud, Konrad Pellikan, and the other ministers of the word, readers, and deacons of the church of Zurich, dearest brothers and lords in Christ.</p>
