    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer and his brother [Thomas] thank Bullinger for the copies of the [„Warhafften Bekanntnuß“] he sent. Immediately after the arrival of Bullinger's packages [with additional copies], a messenger from Augsburg [...] and a pastor from Württemberg [...] came, so the copies that Bullinger sent to Blarer [for forwarding] were certainly already delivered [in Augsburg and Württemberg]. [Ulrich of Württemberg] shies away from any reading and prefers to go hunting. Blarer would have wished [the „Warhaffte Bekanntnuß“] to be somewhat shorter so that it would find many buyers and readers, as there are significant men and courtiers who should read the writing but are deterred by its length. Apart from that, there is nothing to criticize. - Blarer wrote so rarely because there were no noteworthy news; news concerning Bullinger or the [Confederates] he always forwards immediately. - [Ferdinand I.] has arrived with others [at the Imperial Diet] in Worms, as Blarer recently reported. Otherwise, there is nothing new about the Imperial Diet. The Council of Trent is already quite well attended. - The messenger wages have already been paid. - Blarer recommends [Jakob], the son of the [Konstanz] pastor Bartholomäus Metzler. He was in Strasbourg for several years, now the father wants to send him to Zurich for certain reasons and on the recommendation of the council. Since he needs a strict hand, he should be placed with Bullinger himself or with Gwalther, Theodor [Bibliander], Otto [Werdmüller], in any case with an excellent man, as the [Fraumünster-Alumnat] probably only accepts Zurichers. He should be prescribed a study plan aimed at general improvement and preparation for the pastoral office. He is more unreasonable than bad and needs correction. [Bartholomäus Metzler] asks for supervision and reporting. The recently [to Zurich] relocated Konrad Curio [Hofherr] praises Bullinger highly; he and [Jakob Metzler] should not live together. - Greetings, also from [Thomas Blarer] and [Konrad] Zwick. - [P.S.:] Inquires about the behavior and the reason for the departure of the girl [Anneli...], who served with Heinrich Haldenstein.</p>

      <p>Greetings. For the copies of your Response sent to us, my esteemed and more than dearest Bullinger, I extend the most ample thanks on behalf of both myself and my brother. If it were as easy to repay as it is to express our heartfelt desire, you would clearly understand that your gift is exceedingly welcome to us.</p>
      <p>May the Lord and our heavenly Father, who is the source of ever-flowing goodness, most graciously compensate both this and your previous generosity towards us from His abundant horn of plenty. You sent the remaining bundles in time; for the day after I received both, a messenger from Augsburg and indeed a pastor from Württemberg arrived, so I have no doubt that each has already received their copies. The prince vehemently avoids all reading, engaging in nothing but hunting and other such activities, worthy of a prince, of course. I would have preferred a shorter response for this one reason, so that it might have more buyers and readers, as I am aware that certain prominent men, and many courtiers, who should know these matters, are soon deterred by the length of these writings. Otherwise, there is nothing in this diligent and clear treatment of the whole matter that could cause any distaste to eager readers. May the Lord grant that everything turns out as happily as it was given by you in the zeal for defending and propagating the truth.</p>
      <p>The reason I have written so rarely for several months now, you will understand, is solely because I had nothing worthy of your attention, as you are engaged in the most sacred matters. I will certainly not allow anything that I think pertains to you or your people to remain unknown to you, should I happen to learn of anything of the sort.</p>
      <p>The Roman King has now come to Worms, to fulfill the duties of the emperor along with some others, as I recently wrote to you. We receive no other news about the council, except that it is now being celebrated with a great attendance of the pontificals. Thus, the most holy father, with his paternal care, relieves the emperor and the other orders of the Roman Empire from this concern and trouble, so that they are not compelled to deal with the matter of religion at the diet. What you write about that beast, I do not doubt that it will attempt; but the Lord, perhaps having mercy on us, will bring about better things for us.</p>
      <p>As for the expenses of the messengers, I have long since received everything from you down to the last penny, so there is no need for you to be concerned about this any further.</p>
      <p>I commend to you in the Lord, as much as I can, this young man, the son of the excellent man and minister of our church, Bartholomäus Metzler. He spent several years in Strasbourg; now his father, following our advice, preferred to send him to you rather than back to Strasbourg for certain reasons. Since he still needs more diligent discipline, we would wish, if it could be done in any way, that he might live either with you or with Gwalther, Theodor, or Otto. If this is not convenient for anyone, then I beseech you by Christ and our friendship, that he be received by some other good man through your kindness. You have a college of students; but if I hear correctly, only Zurichers are admitted to it. However, whatever the case may be, I gladly promise myself that you will ensure that he is placed somewhere where he will not lack discipline or the convenience of living and applying himself to studies. You will prescribe to him a course of studies according to your lectures; you will exhort him from time to time to better fruit and all those things that can prepare him for the ministry to which he is destined. He is of a more imprudent than bad nature and altogether such that he needs correction from time to time, lest he become insolent. His father earnestly asks you, as much as he can, to take on this care of his son for Christ's sake, and to inform us from time to time how he conducts himself. That Conrad Curio, who was recently there and rented a house, has praised your kindness and helpfulness towards him beyond measure, so that in this respect too you have bound me to you anew. I do not think it would be beneficial for either of them to live together, this young man and Conrad, and that for not insignificant reasons.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, and in turn, be assured that I will diligently attend to all those things which I think you wish and which pertain to you. May your whole household be well. Give my regards to your fellow ministers and all friends. Our people send their greetings to you, especially my brother and Zwick. We commend ourselves to your holy prayers, that amidst these most turbulent times of all things, we may be allowed to be secure and tranquil.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, March 23.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>But what about that girl, about whom I recently asked you to inform me, who served as a maid with Heinrich Haldenstein? Write back, I beg you, how she conducted herself and for what reasons she left there.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his especially esteemed and dearest brother.</p>
