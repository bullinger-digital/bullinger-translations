      <p>Greetings. After my last letter to you, I received yours written on the 21st of this month along with several pages. I have been so occupied that I have only managed to read eight pages, which I find very pleasing and believe will be useful at this time. When they are available for sale, I will send them to the Bishop of Rennes and in France, when it seems timely to you and you have judged it necessary to do so. Regarding the controversy of the people of Glarus, you will learn more accurately from the mayor, a very prudent man, and how much the usurers have troubled me by demanding excessive interest for the money lent in the name of King Henry.</p>
      <p>I owe much to that good and excellent man, who acted as a mediator and endured the troubles of Pfiffer. I am sending you the bull you desire, which will indeed be a bull.</p>
      <p>I privately met with the delegates of the Five Cantons and discussed the matter of the people of Glarus extensively. They have promised me that all will be settled and that they will follow more peaceful counsels.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet all friends.</p>
      <p>Baden, January 14.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
