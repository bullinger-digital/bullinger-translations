      <p>Favorable, dear sir, some of our countrymen have recently returned home from France, whom I have not seen myself; but I heard they report wonderful things and practices. But my cousin Adam will inform you verbally of what they say.</p>
      <p>Many Dutchmen are said to be moving towards the Count, and they also say that one should no longer hope for peace, etc. I often think now of the prophecy of Liechtenberger, written 90 years ago about the great eclipses and conjunctions of the planets, especially in a chapter where he prophesies about France, woe and alas, when a child will sit on the throne of the lilies; then the greatest discord will arise because of religion, which has never been seen before and will not come again (after its end), which will begin in the year 1560 and extend until the year 1570; then a unity of religion will be made, yet this rebellion will go through the land of the lion and end in the land of the virgin, etc.</p>
      <p>At the same time, the eagle will also be badly reputed and lose its best feathers, etc. After all this, it has been reported that my son Conrad is also coming, where I hoped he would at least write to me. But I have received nothing else than this note written to me by Bartholome Oschwald; send it back to me. I suspect it is such that my son does not want to write.</p>
      <p>However, I hear that he and other countrymen of ours, who are of our religion, went to the captain and asked for passports, but they could not obtain any.</p>
      <p>The reason will be revealed in time.</p>
      <p>In summary, none of ours have been able to bring out a letter; but all the enemies have been coming out for weeks; it is an indication of a deception, as it is feared, one will find out how things stand with them; but the limping messenger will bring the true truth, etc.</p>
