      <p>Again, I hear that Mr. Brenz has published a book on the matter of ubiquity. I have not yet had the opportunity to see it; however, it pains me greatly if, by neglecting other arguments more useful and necessary for the church of God, you should devote any time to that cause. Indeed, I would prefer that no response be made, but rather that in some useful and notable work, only a brief mention be made, and the reasons for the omitted response be briefly given. But who am I to say this to you? I beg you to pardon my rashness.</p>
      <p>To the Reverend man, distinguished in excellent piety and doctrine, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Zürich church, a lord to be honored with all reverence. In Zürich.</p>
