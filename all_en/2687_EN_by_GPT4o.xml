      <p>Strassburg, 6th August 1555.</p>
      <p>There are two reasons that compel me to write now: one, so that I do not seem to neglect my duty by not returning the greeting to you, most learned man, who have so often sent me friendly greetings in letters from others. I both say and wish you greetings, and that sincerely, eternal ones. The other reason is that I wanted to use your name, under which I could safely send these letters and the packet, which I am delivering together with them, to Mr. Chamber. If there is any fault in this matter, your kindness towards the English has granted this permission. But I know that you will bear this with equanimity, in the same way that you always treat the English, exiles for Christ. Certainly, our gracious and truthful God, who does not withhold the duties of parents from us who have left our natural parents. If only I would seriously reflect on this sometime: then I would not be entirely ungrateful to God and would somehow show myself grateful to you and patrons like you. And because (as I hope) my brothers in ZÃ¼rich far surpass me in this matter, I therefore dare to appeal to you more freely in their affairs than in my private ones. Farewell. Mr. Martyr greets you, and he is also in good health. You will receive the few English news we have from Mr. Chamber. Farewell again, my most esteemed father and lord.</p>
      <p>Strassburg, (1555).</p>
      <p>Yours, Thomas Sampson.</p>
