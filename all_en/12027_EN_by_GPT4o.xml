    <p xml:id="regest1">The two letters of consolation from Bullinger increase his respect and love, which he has always felt for him and his works, and they strengthen him in the difficult situation of the church, which has been caused by the devil's raging before his defeat and the change of circumstances; never had the Church of Christ fiercer opponents, yet God will help, while the scholars, especially in Germany under the moderate governments, have to pursue their studies. Nothing torments him as much as the newly inflamed dispute over the Holy Communion, which divides the church and also corrupts the pious - may God help! He heard that Bibliander is giving lectures on the Apocalypse, the publication of which is desired by all [Frankfurt] believers for the consolation and strengthening of the church; otherwise, Bullinger should ask Rudolf [Gwalther] for a copy for Pistorius and have it delivered to him by [Christoph] Froschauer. The [Zurich] young men [Rudolf Kopp, Bernhard Lindauer, as well as Wolfgang Haller or Johann Felix Renner] have arrived safely in Wittenberg after a one-month stay in Marburg and will probably return to [Zurich] by Michaelmas [September 29]. Bullinger should pray for [the people of Frankfurt] and the entire church; God will support the [Protestant] clergy; greetings, especially to Rudolf Gwalther, who should send Pistorius news about the French war to the house of Melchior [Ambach] in Frankfurt; the Emperor is said to have announced another Diet of Worms on religious matters; greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God our Father through Jesus Christ in the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>For a long time now, most esteemed Bullinger, I have begun to admire and love you greatly for your most learned and pious writings. However, when I recently read through your very serious consolations written to me in two letters, I embraced you with the utmost respect and ardent love. For in your speech shone both the sharpness of intellect and singular erudition, as well as true piety, the combination of which virtues nothing more beautiful, nothing more lovable can be imagined. Therefore, in return, I ask you to embrace me with your goodwill. I will confess, however, what is true, that I have not only been delighted by your speech but also strengthened in these tribulations and the miseries of the church, although I am not a little moved otherwise by the image with which I am accustomed to remind myself of all times of the church, and I propose to myself to always look at it well in all dangers, namely that Satan brings upon himself the greatest disasters when he fights most fiercely for his kingdom and rages most atrociously. He never fought more fiercely than when he tried to overthrow our leader Christ himself, but in that battle, he succumbed most of all, and a change of the whole world followed afterward. The greatest changes of things followed after the madness of Pharaoh and Maxentius, concerning which it is fitting for us to hope better, however perilous the times may be, the more the strength of the devil seems to grow both in sycophants and in tyrants. For although the church of Christ seems never to have encountered more rabid and impudent adversaries, and the ruins and changes of empires have often harshly shaken the church of God, there is no doubt that the most good and great God will preserve some refuges for the church for the sake of the Son. In the meantime, let us modestly do our duty and commend the outcomes to God, who will take care that the churches do not perish utterly, however much some members may be slaughtered. And perhaps for this reason, he has placed some churches in the German cities, which have somewhat more tranquil and moderate governments than any other nations. Therefore, I often think and proclaim in many ways that you are blessed, who are mostly free from the often most foolish affairs of princes and can enjoy the studies of sacred literature in the tranquility of your cities. You are not oppressed by courtly tyrannies, nor are your disciplines hindered, nor are your studies disturbed by the panics of princely tumults.</p>
      <p>I could recite many other things, which I omit. For what shall I say, that the sacramental contention, which was scarcely in any way quieted, is being revived anew by some?</p>
      <p>There is nothing else that torments my mind more. For I have seen and experienced the losses of this contention. Indeed, I shudder with my whole body whenever I think that these sacred symbols, through which Christ our Lord truly and effectively offers himself, his body and blood, and all his gifts to the faithful and unites them with the greatest love, will become, through our fault, instruments of dissension and schism. Christ wished to gather and unite his church with the most holy sacraments; now, through our obstinacy, the church is being dissipated and most miserably torn apart. Would that they would consider at least that of the poet:</p>
      <p>“Peace is the best of things, which it is given to man to know, peace alone is more valuable than innumerable triumphs,”</p>
      <p>if they refuse to hear the Holy Spirit in any place in Scripture exhorting to peace, concord, unity, and truth! But where does the impulse carry me, not to say the zeal of the house of the Lord. Would that God, for the sake of Christ, would remove this dissension in the church and put an end to it once and for all, whereby piety is not only hindered in evils but also gravely in some pious ones!</p>
      <p>I hear that Mr. Bibliander is now publicly lecturing on the Apocalypse of John, which book graphically depicts the weakness, scandals, and tribulations of the church of Christ and at the same time greatly consoles the pious in these. Therefore, all good and pious people among us desire that Bibliander publicly propose his meditations on this book to be read by the church by committing them to the press, so that in these great evils they may have some consolation by which they can sustain themselves through the Holy Spirit.</p>
      <p>But if he absolutely does not want to publish, I ask you to beseech Rudolf in my name, so that he may procure a copy at my expense and send it to me through Froschauer.</p>
      <p>Your learned and pious young men left Marburg after a month's stay and safely and soundly reached Wittenberg, as I hear, intending, God willing, to revisit you by the feast of Michaelmas.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord Jesus most happily, most illustrious Bullinger, together with your whole household and church, and I ask that you commend us and our entire church to God in your prayers. We are especially sustained by this hope.</p>
      <p>For those whose minds God has stirred to the office of the gospel and called, he will undoubtedly also assist their labors and struggles when invoked, so that at least some part of the human race may perform duties pleasing to God, lest the whole human race furiously oppose God and perish. I earnestly pray that you most courteously and diligently greet all your fellow ministers, my most esteemed lords and brothers, Bibliander, Pellican, and the others, especially Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, an old friend, whom I would like you to remind also to write me something certain about the French war (while it is possible through a messenger); for he can do this because of the proximity. When he wishes to send letters, he can do so most easily, provided he has a messenger who will go to Frankfurt and there deliver them to the house of Mr. Melchior, the churchman. He can offer these to me daily. I sincerely pray for good health for all of you. They say that the Emperor has again announced a Diet at Worms on the matter of religion. If this is true, we will again be vexed by deceitful reconciliations, especially since the adversaries do not understand religion. Although I will try everything to exempt myself from these. Several ministers of the word in the Niddan field greet you. Hastily, from Frankfurt, September 10, in the year of our Lord 1544.</p>
      <p>Johannes Pistorius Niddanus, entirely yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in both learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, theologian of Zurich, his most esteemed lord, etc.</p>
