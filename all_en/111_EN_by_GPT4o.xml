      <p>Regarding Claudius, it truly pains me that you have troubled yourself with so much writing. That same letter has only just reached me through Buttler with your latest writing. I thank you most sincerely and earnestly ask you not to hold anything against me regarding this matter. My lords are writing to the good lord and host in Winterthur with their opinion; if Claudius complies, he will be well, if not, I believe my lords will seriously punish him along with the woman, who claims to be completely innocent. God have mercy on us all! Their misery has deeply moved me; but for whom there is no advice, there is no way to help. I must commend it to God; I deeply regret your trouble and hard work. But you have more than compensated me with your courteous writing. Forgive me; I intend, if I have good intentions, not to do it again, and partly through your letter, I have also been relieved of some concerns regarding Claudius. Praise be to the Lord for all good things in eternity!</p>
      <p>I have no news to write to you. Not a word has come from Augsburg since then. Our envoys have arrived safely and happily, having a very good, quiet lodging; thus waiting to see what God will further provide.</p>
