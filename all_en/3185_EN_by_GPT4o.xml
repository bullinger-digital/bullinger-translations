      <p> Greetings. I am sending again a few leaves to complete the first quire and the second, only two of the third, the first of which will also be completed tomorrow. But hereafter, we will have three forms each day, God willing; for until now, our people have been practicing reading your script, and I hope that henceforth the matter will proceed somewhat better. However, it pains me not a little that I cannot entirely prevent any errors from appearing, at least through our fault; but they can be corrected by your diligence and placed not at the end of the book, but immediately under the preface, rather at the front of the book, so that what needs to be corrected appears immediately to the reader. I greatly approve of the method of indexing you suggest, and because this can be done much more conveniently by Mr. Lavater, your son-in-law, I will gladly keep watch over the leaves being sent to you as soon as they are printed, so that we are not delayed in this part either and to relieve that labor, which will be most pleasing to me. Regarding the addition to your orations, which you write you will complete within a month, there is no need to hurry; the copies I still have will suffice even for the next fair; but afterwards, when they will need to be reprinted, I wanted the addition obtained from you, for which I am already promised and I rejoice and thank you, and I pray to the best and greatest Lord that you may continue to complete it at your leisure, who may preserve you and yours safe for a long time. Farewell and forgive; it had to be written suddenly. As soon as your letters were returned to me, it was indicated at the same time that those who had brought them would only take a meal and leave immediately, which I also had indicated to Junius and Sulcer, and in the meantime, I also wrote and collected the papers I am sending. Farewell again. May 16, 1557. </p>
      <p> Your Johannes Oporinus from the heart. </p>
