      <p>Philipp the Elder, by the grace of God Landgrave of Hesse, Count of Katzenelnbogen, etc. Our gracious greetings beforehand, worthy and highly learned, dear special one. We have received and read your letter dated Zurich, July 15th, and we graciously thank you for the news shared with us. We also want to assure you that your son Christoph, who is at our court, will be under our gracious care. As for the other matters concerning your and the other theologians' writings, we have responded to both you and them herewith, and we do not doubt that it will remain undisclosed, and it would be very good if the quarrel could be resolved once and for all.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we want to inform you in response to your letter, and we are graciously inclined towards you. Dated Rauschenberg, July 30th, in the year 1566.</p>
      <p>Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, etc., has signed. To the worthy and highly learned, our dear, special honor Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, pastor of the church in Zurich.</p>
