      <p>I clearly think (most learned man) that the same thing happened to my writings sent to you, as you recently complained about yours, namely that they were lost and not returned to you, because I could not perceive anything certain from there; but it does not matter much; for I had written nothing other than that your letters to Prince Georg of Württemberg were written as soon as possible and were taken care of with the utmost diligence. If he himself has delayed the response, for what reason this is done, I do not know. Of the new things, which I had none to write about then, nor do I have now, as I expect such things from you, to whom many and various things are communicated through the writings of outstanding and learned men, and unless it would be troublesome, I ask you by your humanity, if you have understood anything about that military tumult in almost the entire empire, to inform me about it, what the intention of the princes and cities is in enlisting such large troops, what also is to be hoped for from the French expedition, which, having left the city of Metz, is heading for the Piedmont region; I think that what you wrote to me a long time ago will happen, namely that Italy will have very serious wars. And there is a rumor among us that that prince from Gießen is going to pass through Zürich with a large cavalry; but whether that is true or not, and when his arrival is expected, I would very much like to know. Meanwhile, in whatever matter I can please you with my service, you will have me most willing. Jakob Keller, the son of Mr. Fridolin in Rümlingen, although the Bishop of Constance has chosen him to be the minister of the church in Rüdlingen and the successor of Finsler, our magistrate, however, did not want to accept him without your letters of recommendation; for a rumor has reached the ears of our people that he is a drunken man, a striker, and I do not know what else, twice deprived of his stipend by you for sins, and promoted to this position by very impious men, namely some relatives. Therefore, he will not be such a minister of the church as necessity requires. We would therefore like him to receive and bring such a testimony, lest, if he sins afterwards, it be imputed and reproached to us that you could not warn our people about Jakob, what he was like and what was to be hoped for from your judgment about him; for if too much is attributed to him in the letters of recommendation, some will object, why your people do not use his service, since he was a stipend holder, etc. Meanwhile, I wish Mr. Theodor, Gwalther, Pellicanus, and the other ministers of the church, along with your son-in-law, one, two, and three, to be well, and I would like to know something certain about Mr. Zwingli's health. We will diligently pray to the Lord that he may allow you all to remain in good health for a long time for our and your church. That furious heretic Osiander has died in Prussia, who was given the name δικαιωτής, undermining the article of justification, which was hitherto intact from the gospel, indeed teaching contrary to it. The Duke of Prussia, having been liberated by Johann Friedrich, asks that he send learned and pious men to bring back the seduced, to extirpate the heresy with the sword of the word of God. Justus Menius and some others are sent. Mr. Major is also stirring up a new contention about the proposition: Good works are necessary for salvation; Major defends it with all his might, many others refute his opinion with public writings. Behold, what ambition, greed, etc., produce, they completely transform men, make teachers of truth into false teachers; hence the greatest danger and damage threatens the Christian church, an indelible scandal, so to speak, is given, etc. May God, the best and greatest, protect our churches and their teachers, lest any contention arise among them in the doctrine of truth, nor false opinions creep in under the guise of truth. Farewell, my Mr. Bullinger, and have me commended to your humanity along with other colleagues. May your wife and children with the whole family be very well. Schaffhausen, April 20, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Jakob Rüeger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in learning and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed lord and brother. In Zürich.</p>
