      <p>Greetings. From your letter, dear brother, written on January 21st, I understand that you are pressed and troubled on all sides. This is not rare for me, indeed I am constantly burdened with the most troublesome cares, and it cannot be otherwise unless it pleases the ministers of the Lord to be less faithful. The world is as the Holy Spirit has described to us in the divine writings; in this we must engage, with this we must contend. But with how much labor, with how much trouble, especially when we are forced to see how little our labor is appreciated and how little it benefits most people. But our Lord and Savior has foretold all these things to us, who also promised the most ample assistance to the faithful. Therefore, let us be faithful in our ministry, let us invoke His help; which when He certainly provides, we will say with the prophet: "In the Lord is my hope; He is my refuge; therefore I will not care what a troublesome man may do." We know here what has happened to you in Graubünden due to the ingratitude and insolence of some. But the Lord must be prayed to, that He may look upon these things and set right what has been badly disrupted. Therefore, our most honorable magistrate writes to the people of Glarus and Schwyz, to open the way for goods or provisions, etc. Furthermore, on February 26th, he has called a public and general assembly at Baden to act on this matter, which is in the interest of us all.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant us His grace!</p>
      <p>We have not heard a word from France. However, it is certainly reported that the city of Saint-Jean-d'Angély has been captured or has offered surrender to the royal forces after driving out the Admiral's supporters. It is also said to be certain that the King of Spain, pressed by the Moors and Turks, is gathering assistance from all sides and, despite these dangers, is nevertheless preparing a marriage, to unite with the daughter of his sister and his cousin. And it is surprising that the Papists do not abhor this; if such marriages were to occur among us, they would be called canine. But let this pass with other errors. In England, the disturbances have been well quelled, and the seditious will pay the penalty. It is also reported that in Germany a proper army of cavalry and infantry is being assembled for the Admiral, which will soon depart for France. However, I affirm nothing here.</p>
      <p>Greet the honorable consuls, the tribune of the people, Mr. Ruinella, Mr. Pontisella, Ganthner, and our other friends. The bearer of this letter to you, the bailiff of Maienfeld, has lived with us familiarly for several days; he is worthy of your friendship as well.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 27, 1570.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger the elder.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, my dearest brother and fellow minister.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
