      <p>Greetings. Since I unexpectedly encountered the courier, most esteemed man, who was already prepared for his journey, it seemed fitting to me to trouble your learned ear with an unlearned letter. "Who," you ask. [Greek] A certain young man from M端lhausen, indeed of good character, is pursuing his literary studies there, having been entrusted to the Z端rich school to learn the liberal arts. Therefore, I commend him to you, and if he should err or falter in any way, reprimand him severely.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In M端lhausen, on the 20th of May, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Apriolus, minister of the word of God.</p>
      <p>To the renowned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the Z端rich church.</p>
