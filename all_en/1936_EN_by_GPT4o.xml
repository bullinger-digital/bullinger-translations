      <p>Greetings. I congratulate you, esteemed fathers and brothers, that you too, having been freed from the yoke of the Antichrist, continue to adhere with all your hearts to Christ, the Son of the eternal God and the blessed Mary. I also pray to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, that He may deign to open the eyes of your minds, so that you may progress more and more in Him. We are certainly at the final point of the last times; the final judgment is upon us; our Lord Jesus Christ will come on the clouds of heaven to judge the living and the dead. Blessed indeed are all who will then be found to be and have been true members of Christ. Outside of Christ, there is no salvation, as the Apostle Peter also said, that there is no other name given among men by which we must be saved except the name of Jesus Christ; for He alone is our priest or pontiff and king, He is our mediator between us sinners and the most just God, He justifies us by bestowing upon us His righteousness, which we receive through faith in Him. He forgives us our sins for His name's sake, He regenerates us by His Spirit, so that, renewed, we may perform new works, not indeed of corrupt flesh, but works of regeneration, I say, of faith, hope, and charity. In His name alone and always, God is to be prayed to, that He may grant us these gifts of His, nor should we doubt the goodness of the Lord, as He testifies and seals to us with the sacraments, namely with the most holy baptism and the saving supper, that He is our Savior, that He wishes us well and has adopted us to attain life. Stand firm in these things, brothers; let no one lead you away by a doctrine that is foreign and contrary to these. He who perseveres to the end will be saved, he who worships the beast will be cast into the lake burning with sulfur, whose smoke ascends forever and ever. Therefore, I exhort you, brothers, by Him who lives forever and ever and by your own salvation, to persevere in the true and Christian faith and to beware of the Antichrist. The Antichrist, says John, is he who denies that Jesus is the Christ. This is what the Pope does; for he openly seizes the kingdom and priesthood for himself, which belong to Christ or the Messiah alone. He takes away the priesthood from Him, while he wants other teachers to be heard on earth than Christ alone in His word, while he substitutes other sacrificers on earth for Christ, sacrificing the mass for the living and the dead, while he shows other mediators and intercessors in heaven than the one Christ Jesus. He takes away the kingdom from Him, while he wants to be the king, emperor, and supreme head on earth, the ecumenical or general pastor, while he demonstrates other helpers in heaven than the one Christ, namely Saint Francis, Saint Benedict, and I don't know how many others, about whom we have nothing certain, whether they are in heaven. The Pope also institutes other orders, changes the rite and form of celebrating the sacraments, sells all sacred things for money, and whatever is in the church. Therefore, you, O brothers, abstain from this Canaanite, abstain from these rites and sacred things, consecrate yourselves entirely to Christ, the true Messiah; He will give grace, so that you may endure, if anything is to be endured for His name's sake. But eternal things are also to be preferred to temporal ones. For what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his own soul?</p>
      <p>Fear God, O brothers, give glory to His Son, believe in Him, flee from the Antichrist and all impiety and all wicked works. Keep yourselves holy by His grace and blameless on that day. Pray diligently for us/you, and that the word of God may run and many may gladly embrace the truth and be freed from spiritual and bodily Sodom. May the Lord Jesus be with your spirit. Farewell. Zürich, among the Swiss, July 22, in the year of our Lord 1553.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours wholly in the Lord, pastor of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent men, Mr. Francesco Piperario, Leonardo Pescarolo, Hieronymus Crotus, and other Christ-loving citizens of Cremona, most esteemed lords and dearest brothers of his.</p>
