      <p>God grant us His grace and strength. Amen.</p>
      <p>My lord and benefactor, regarding the bath gift from Duke Ulrich of Württemberg for Mayor Röist, my lord Vadian has faithfully concluded (decided) with me and has immediately sent a citizen today to Lord Georg von Hewen in Tuttlingen, with a serious and confidential command for the hoped-for dispatch, etc. etc. This person is known to von Hewen. He also let me read a letter written to him by von Hewen these days: among other things, that he has captured two deer, and that he hopes to soon have more captured. The messenger is also going there, in case von Hewen undertakes something forceful, so that it might perhaps take too long to Stuttgart, or to let it take long to Stuttgart, etc. Accordingly, I have informed my wife about your loyalty, along with others, regarding the Zürichberg matter. If it is God's will, she desires this, in good hope, that my gracious lord would see wife and child. And although I know how you are inclined, to spare nothing, we still ask you to remind my lord Röist that we are driven from our possessions, for our sake and from the fatherland. Even if God rightly punishes us for accusations, yet, praise be to God, His word and that which concerns the city of Zurich's condition and command are the highest causes; hopefully, they will be considered appropriately. You know what needs to be done. I leave it at that. I desire to earn (repay) it eternally. God be your reward.</p>
      <p>I ask you to greet my lord Master Kaspar and the goldsmith for me. There is much talk as if Master Ambrosius Blarer has recanted.</p>
      <p>Greetings to your wife.</p>
      <p>Done in St. Gallen, Sunday, the 6th day of September, in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>Your willing poor Hans Vogler, now in St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>Peter Weber has been before the abbot's council. He does not say what was discussed with him, etc. However, he is cheerful. Also, the abbot, through the captain, has requested of them; requested whether they will allow the reformed pastor to remain for another year or not pursue him further, as he will allow them the year. Thus, they bring it to the community; however, I suspect not.</p>
      <p>To my particularly favorable lord and friend M. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of my gracious lords in Zurich.</p>
