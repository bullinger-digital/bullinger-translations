      <p>Greetings. I would have written to you recently through Laelius, dearest lord and compater, if I had not decided to come there myself. But since my journey was hindered, I could not refrain from writing a few words even now. Indeed, there are many things to write about; but letters cannot contain everything, nor do I have much leisure at the moment. If the Lord wills that I come there, I will discuss many things with you in detail: first, I think you have heard something about the new dispute between the people of Geneva and ours, and how they have recently beheaded one of their exiles whom they captured.</p>
      <p>The story is long and cannot be explained in a few words; therefore, I will defer it until my arrival, or otherwise, if you wish, I will write when I have more leisure. Likewise, about the new contention of our French regarding the descent of the Lord into hell, and also what the people of Lausanne have obtained from our senate concerning ecclesiastical discipline, which they have been demanding for so long. They have been given the opportunity to draft some form, which, if established, will be examined by our people and then it will be decided what can be accepted or not.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, our church has also adopted a more frequent use of singing Psalms, and the matter is proceeding well. There is also now a reading during the action of the Lord's Supper as in Zürich, which was not previously held. Besides the new things that are already public, we have nothing.</p>
      <p>Dr. Albin and Glaner praise your humanity greatly, so much so that I rejoice in your name and that of others; however, I am surprised where my brother has been, since they were in Zürich; for they could tell me nothing about him.</p>
      <p>My private affairs are as before: I live like a solitary pastor above the house and see my affairs so arranged that I cannot be without a wife for long; therefore, I begin to think of another, since it seemed good to the Lord to take another from me. I earnestly ask you, indeed I beseech you by our connection, that you also deign to assist me here with your counsel and help; I see that even wise men become more foolish in this matter than in any other, and the examples of many terrify me; I would have married a hundred times sooner than now even once.</p>
      <p>There are many obstacles and impediments, and I see that I must endure something. Many are offered here, but they are not such as I would wish.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the Lord must be asked to suggest to us the one who pleases Him; for although a prudent wife is given by the Lord, the house and paternal affairs come by inheritance. I pray that the Lord may give me such a one and not punish me with a troublesome and malicious wife, and I also ask you to help me in this matter. Farewell happily in the Lord with all yours, to each of whom I send many greetings. Bern, the first of June, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your H[aller].</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his dearest and most esteemed lord and compater.</p>
