    <p xml:id="regest1">The letter bearer Hans Fridinger, from whom the Abbot of Fischingen [Markus Schenkli] withdrew his benefice [in Bettwiesen] at the most recent Baden Diet, wishes to seek his livelihood in the Zurich area and has therefore requested a testimonial; the Zurich envoy Johannes Haab will have already reported about him. They confirm that Fridinger has never given cause for complaint and can be recommended as a pastor. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace be with you, most distinguished prelate.</p>
      <p>Our beloved brother Hans Fridinger, the bearer of this letter, appeared before us and recounted the circumstances of his situation. He explained how, at the recent Baden Diet, due to some shortage of income, the Abbot of Fischingen deprived him of his benefice, even though his church had resisted in many ways. Persuaded by his brothers, he proposed to seek refuge under your jurisdiction, hoping to obtain some position among the people of Zurich, so that he and his children might be more easily provided for in terms of sustenance and clothing. He thought it advisable to carry with him testimonial letters from his brothers, who are well acquainted with his past life and conduct, so that you (most excellent patron), the pious magistrate, and all the patricians might be assured that he was removed from his church for no other fault or offense than the aforementioned reason.</p>
      <p>Undoubtedly, your distinguished patrician and envoy, M. Johannes Haab, has already explained the entire situation of this brother to you. He also requested us, who have known him for many years, not to refuse to provide him with such testimonial letters. We therefore confess that this brother has conducted himself among us without any offense, as far as we know, and we have not heard otherwise from his closer neighbors, colleagues, and subjects, than that he has managed his church well, both by example and doctrine, indeed worthy to preside over a pious and prudent assembly; for we do not doubt that he will fulfill all the qualities of a good and learned pastor. Therefore, we commend him to you (most illustrious man), not doubting that whatever benefit you bestow upon him will be bestowed upon Christ himself.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet Theodor Bibliander and all the pious ones for us. Given and sealed with the seal of Master Alexander on the 25th of April in the year 1542.</p>
      <p>Huldrych Amantius, M. Alexander Schmutz, Johannes Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man and most distinguished prelate of the Zurich church, M. Heinrich Bullinger, our lord and patron, to be especially revered.</p>
