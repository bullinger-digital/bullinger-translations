      <p> Greetings. It does not escape you, most learned men and my esteemed lords, how great a storm has now invaded and oppressed us who announce the word of the Lord in these regions, and that the imperial cities have been forced to return to papism. It is not safe to write much about this matter. And since almost all the other cities have unwillingly accepted papism, only Kaufbeuren has both willingly and unwillingly instituted the mass and other papist ceremonies and doctrines, and has embraced them, and has removed and dismissed me from the duty of teaching. Furthermore, since I do not wish to entirely abandon the small gift of God in me and the very letters, and I understand that there is no longer a place for me in these regions, I turn to you, asking for advice and help, so that if you know of any place there or elsewhere where there is a vacancy for teaching the gospel or a public school, you may deign to provide for me out of Christian love. I will refuse nothing, provided I can serve Christ and the letters. Therefore, please write back to me what hope there is with you regarding this matter, and at the same time, whether it is permissible for me to move there with my belongings and family, and whether lodging can be prepared and rented in the meantime. If there is no place at present, I still ask that if anything becomes vacant in the future, you may be my supporters and patrons, and inform me, staying here for a while, through a messenger at my expense. I will most eagerly repay your efforts with whatever services I can, and I will not allow anyone to rightfully accuse me of ingratitude. </p>
      <p> Farewell, my most esteemed lords, and write back. Given at Kaufbeuren, August 26, 1548. </p>
      <p> M. Thomas Naogeorgus </p>
      <p> To the most excellent men in piety and learning, and lords, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger and other doctors and ministers of the Church of Zürich, my most esteemed lords. </p>
