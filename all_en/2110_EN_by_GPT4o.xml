      <p>I acknowledge that I owe you greatly for your kind disposition towards me and the benefits offered both through Mr. Vergerius and through your letters. It is a significant matter for a citizen of ZÃ¼rich to have received anything from a prince. However, I am a citizen, a guardian of the laws, and the pastor and minister of this church.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus grant me to be what I am reputed to be. I confess that I am a sinner and unworthy of such duties; but in the meantime, having obtained grace, I have a willing mind to perform my duty. Even if I were neither a citizen nor a minister of this church nor bound by any sacred and fundamental laws, my spirit, which is very desirous of freedom, and my conscience, which I have enjoyed peacefully since childhood by the grace of God, shudders and recoils from gifts. Often, gifts from nobles, my sincere friends, have been offered to me; but I have never accepted anything from anyone. I am content with my salary and live frugally as much as I can, and I teach frugality to my own. Soon, as the saying goes, I will set foot in Charon's boat; for I have nearly completed my fiftieth year of life. Therefore, I think to spend the remainder of my life, if the Lord my God grants it to me, in my modesty or poverty. It is not fitting for theologians to amass treasures in this world, but it is fitting to adorn the doctrine of our Savior Jesus Christ with a moderate life. You know that golden saying of the divine Apostle Paul: "Godliness with contentment is great gain. For we brought nothing into the world, and we can take nothing out of it; but if we have food and clothing, we will be content with that. Those who want to get rich fall into temptation," etc., and the rest, which you know from 1 Timothy 6. I pray without ceasing to the Lord, that not only I but all who serve Christ, our great high priest, and his most holy bride, the church, in preaching the gospel, may be so prepared by the Lord that we may always be able to say with his apostle: "I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. I know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty (I have learned the secret of being content in any and every situation), whether well fed or hungry, whether living in plenty or in want. I can do all this through Christ who gives me strength." Thus spoke the chosen vessel to the Philippians, chapter 4. I perhaps explain these things to you at length not for any other purpose than that you may see the purpose of my mind and not think that anything is done by me here out of pride or contempt. Furthermore, you will find that I am not ungrateful for your goodwill. I am ready of my own accord and willingly to serve you in all pious requests, and perhaps more faithfully than those whom you consider most obliged to you. Since I know that generous spirits, unless they can compete with mutual services, groan, come, my reverend lord, help as much as you can those who are striving to discover and assert the truth of Christ's gospel, so that they may not be crushed more cruelly by persecution, if not more boldly; help so that that saving truth, which is for all men, may someday be known purely to your most powerful prince and flourishing kingdom. You know, however, that in this cause you will not only gratify me but more so him to whom you belong entirely in soul and body, who created you, redeemed you, gives you life, and will judge you. Farewell.</p>
