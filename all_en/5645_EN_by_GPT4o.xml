      <p>Greetings. I neither wanted nor ought to write much to your kindness.</p>
      <p>There are many reasons, partly because I know there is no doubt that you have been almost worn out by labors for some time now, and also because the news that is spread here and there is so uncertain that those who hasten to write it sometimes have to retract it.</p>
      <p>However, I do inform you that your son Christoph visited me, to whom, if I could, I would have provided whatever would have been pleasing to him.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ, who may keep you safe with us for a longer time. Schaffhausen, March 15, 1563.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Jakob RÃ¼eger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zurich, lord and brother, indeed rather his father, to be greatly respected.</p>
