      <p>Greetings. Persistent insistence is an invincible matter. This man is indeed good and not unlearned, and he could be of use if he had a little more prudence.</p>
      <p>He has not ceased to insist that I commend him to you. Therefore, I commend him as a poor man of Christ who needs to be helped. You decide how he might be of use. I do not wish anyone to be burdened; nor do I wish those who need necessary help or who can be of some use to the church to be deprived of help or repelled from the use of the church. Therefore, receive this man as the Lord suggests to you, and let us pray for the churches of God in the southern Netherlands, which are being harassed in horrendous ways, not so much by the most severe persecution of the Emperor, but by the Jorists and Libertine plagues. However, it is to be congratulated that they produce so many very strong confessors in both sexes.</p>
      <p>Mr. Eustache Du Quesnoy, who once visited you when he was with Simon Grynaeus in Basel, if I am not mistaken, is now also in exile here, separated from his wife Jeanne de Fourmestraux and four children, and from a very rich patrimony.</p>
      <p>Four people were sacrificed to the Lord by fire in Antwerp these days, whom their relatives wanted to redeem with 40,000 gold coins. But although the Emperor now scrapes together money from everywhere, he preferred their souls to the money. Pray for the Bishop of Münster, whom the Antichrist seeks in wondrous and very serious ways through Duke Heinrich of Brunswick.</p>
      <p>Farewell to all in Christ.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, April 11, 1545.</p>
      <p>M. Bucer, yours.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, to be respected in the Lord.</p>
