      <p>How sad my departure from you was, due to the massacre that has spread among the faithful throughout France, is testified by the tears that have not yet ceased. The pain is made even more bitter because the majority of the nobles, both of our church and the papist church, are inclined to elect as king the one who most cruelly slaughtered so many innocent heroes. For the King of France, upon learning of the death of our king, sent his envoy to us, who, in the name of his brother Heinrich, claimed the kingdom and asked for the hand in marriage of the sister of our deceased king.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a large part of our nobility, led by some opinion of his virtues, decided that he should be adorned with royal dignity. But having been persuaded by us about that tyrannical savagery and the great massacre cruelly and deceitfully perpetrated against the pious innocents, and having been drawn back by their conscience, they allowed themselves to be somewhat diverted from their purpose. However, they are not satisfied with our simple narration and wish to be convinced by more evidence and to be made more certain about that notable cruelty. Conquered by our lamentation of those calamities, they unanimously incline to receive something authentic from you, in which the whole matter is abundantly described, from where that massacre originated.</p>
      <p>The envoy, who is Johannes Monlucius, Bishop of Valence, uses astonishing excuses, by which he miserably slanders the slaughtered and transfers all the blame onto them, as if they were plotting the king's ruin and had come to those weddings as conspirators. And so that he does not deviate from his purpose, but promotes the Angevin by all means, as he began, with the bishops and similar swine from the flock favoring him and spurring him on, a new delegation is sent by the French tyrant to excuse his crime and declare that the blame lies with the slain. Concerning this matter, we here contend most gravely and, if we were sufficient, we would wish to refute this slander with our blood. But because we are not sufficient, we therefore pray and beseech you to have mercy not only on our afflicted homeland but also on the slaughtered, so that they are not overwhelmed by so many false slanders. This will happen if you send some authentic writing, sufficiently declaring how the matter was conducted, whether printed or handwritten, so that you may help us who are laboring and afflicted and prevent such a cruel tyrant from being honored. I have been waiting for the letters you promised for so long, and I am surprised that you have written nothing to me, nor to Mr. Treasurer and Duditius, but neither has Heinrich Bullinger the Younger sent what he also promised. Therefore, I ask that we finally receive something from you without delay.</p>
      <p>I wish you all the greatest happiness and diligently greet your fellow believers.</p>
      <p>Given in Krakau, December 5, 1572.</p>
      <p>I ask you, most learned Simler, to communicate the same to Mr. Beza without delay, so that it may be prevented that this tyrant occupies power in this kingdom; otherwise, with him reigning here, you will have me, a miserable man who is hated by the entire French faction here, as an exile with my little family.</p>
