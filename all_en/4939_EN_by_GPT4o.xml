      <p>I received your most courteous letter written on June 23rd at the end of August, most learned Bullinger. How much they encouraged me, how much they inflamed me to be cheerful and strong in the Lord in my duty, I can hardly say: I pray that you continue to spur me on with such encouragements. Spurs must be applied to a slow horse.</p>
      <p>May the Lord convert or crush the five satrapies of the Philistines, which do not cease to cause trouble to the pious! I rejoice that Burcher has been separated from that vile harlot by divorce; may it be fortunate and prosperous for him that he has married another.</p>
      <p>I am now writing to Burcher about Burcher and his affairs. You will learn the rest from him.</p>
      <p>I wish a better mind for the Ubiquitarians, if only they have a mind, since they are both mad and insane; you and Master Martyr will easily defeat them. But I know the nature of the boastful.</p>
      <p>The defeated will not yield; but unless they come to their senses, Christ will conquer them, and Satan will bind them. May the Lord strengthen the Elector Palatine of the Rhine and the Landgrave of Hesse with His spirit, and keep them safe for a long time! Julius, who was not only an ear-witness but also an eye-witness of many things, has told you the rest.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name your excellent wife, sons, daughters, sons-in-law, Master Martyr, Master Gesner, Wolphius, and all.</p>
      <p>All mine to you all.</p>
      <p>Hastily, at Ludham, September 1, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your John Parkhurst of Norwich.</p>
      <p>I have instructed all the ministers of the word throughout all Suffolk and Norfolk to obtain your sermons on the Apocalypse for themselves, either in Latin or English. For John Daus, a good and learned man, a schoolmaster in the city of Ipswich, has translated them into our vernacular language. Farewell again, and may the people of Zürich fare well.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
