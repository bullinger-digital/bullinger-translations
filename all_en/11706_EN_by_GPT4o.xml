    <p xml:id="regest1">He has read the remaining parts of the Matthew commentary [HBBibl I 144] with approval and attributes it to Bullinger's sound judgment and great spirit that he was able to publish this work in such a short time; furthermore, it is thanks to Bullinger's diligent reading and tireless practice that he is able to express himself eloquently and fluently and to write with similar abundance as Varro, Cicero, Hieronymus, Augustine, and above all Origen. Vadian knows he is in agreement with Bullinger on the question of the Lord's Supper; Bullinger manages to express himself clearly and decisively without alienating himself from the expressions of other churches. He has also responded so comprehensively to [Kaspar] Schwenckfeld's teachings that no further reply is necessary; he leaves no escape for the hypocrites. Thanks be to God for his gifts. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The remaining parts of your work on Matthew were delivered to me promptly. I am greatly pleased with everything, and I affirm this not with a flattering spirit, but with a certain and joyful judgment, attributing it to the overflowing treasure of your mind, that you were able to accomplish in such a short time and with seemingly hasty work what many do not achieve with much premeditation and many years of revising and altering their writings in a thousand ways. I attribute this to your abundance of knowledge and frequent reading, and, which is the highest in every profession, tireless practice, so that what you have ready and at hand, you can share and make common with others with your elegant and facile pen without reluctance. The same vein and richness have produced so many books for Varro, so many for Cicero, and indeed, so many for Hieronymus, Augustine, and above all, Origen, those myriads of writings. I have indeed seen the passage about the Lord's Supper, in which you confirm our understanding so much that nothing could be more so. But now you use such clear and eloquent language, yet in such a way that the various expressions, which other churches of Christ use with great benefit of piety, seem neither foreign in sense nor in the explanation of the mystery, and are clearly perceived all around. And to Schwenckfeld, you have responded so comprehensively, piously, and circumspectly that it seems neither our efforts nor those of others, whom I hear are arming against him, are needed. And for the hypocrites (which I especially sought from you in writing), every path of their madness is blocked. Thanks be to our Lord through His Son Jesus, who does not cease to generously and readily bestow His gifts upon us who labor and are burdened by the most unjust times. In this, I wish you well with your entire college and hope you remember me, who favors you sincerely. St. Gallen, 19th of September, in the year 1542.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian (von Watt).</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most illustrious city of Zurich, a lord and friend to be especially honored.</p>
