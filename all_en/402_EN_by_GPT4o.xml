      <p>S. D. For the cause of the Gospel of Christ, our Redeemer (my most learned Lord Bullinger), having been agitated and weakened by many and various inconveniences, alas, it not only does not have anyone whose fairness it might be refreshed by, but it has been ordered to be exiled far from the borders of Germany. Is this the gratitude we bear to Christ, that our most merciful Savior does not have a place to set his foot? Is this how we should remember the benefits of the most good and great God and His love for the human race, and we who were children of wrath and sin, redeemed by the precious blood of Christ and restored to grace with the Father, do we so cruelly drive Him away from us? Would it not be a sign of the greatest ingratitude to expel any man, even of the lowest rank, or one who has deserved well of us, without first returning gratitude for his services? How much punishment or penalty, then, shall we judge those worthy of, who expel the most faithful author of our souls and the only author of salvation without any crime being alleged or cause being declared, so that He who has deserved the best of the human race seems to have deserved the worst of all?</p>
      <p>O heaven, o earth, o corrupted name of Adam, how long do we insult Christ and pursue Him, to whom we owe all that we live and all that we are? But what can those who still support the cause of Christ do against force and violence, who have little resources and most are treacherous? I do not doubt that you have already understood this with your prudence. "But to what end," you will say, "is this? Why do you cry out so much?"</p>
      <p>It is precisely this, that Christ, who had no place in the inn from His cradle, having been vexed by many insults and tossed by many injuries, is finally compelled by the treachery of our princes to leave the land and seek other seats. Why so? This good Christ, who barely clung to the lowest place among the Württembergers, now, with all the ministers of the divine word dismissed, must necessarily go into exile with them. O the treachery of mortals, o men more ungrateful than ingratitude itself, who, having taken up Christ not for salvation but for private gain, which they sought in His name, did not wish to retain Him even when they obtained everything under His pretext. But if, seeking the salvation of souls, they had lost as much of their goods in the name of Christ as they have obtained under His pretext (for I speak only of temporal goods), what do we think they would do then?</p>
      <p>Does it not seem to you a matter worthy of tears, with Christ now miserably expelled, the true leader to salvation, to send the souls of the wretched, led by the antichrist and his followers, to the underworld and the realms of Pluto? O if only I could match such miseries and calamities with tears alone, so that the unhappy and wandering flock would not have to experience such evils for long. O if only I could bring help as much as I am prepared in spirit to do so. But why do I weep, why do I cry out, or what can the power of a few do against the most powerful princes of the world, you do not ignore. Therefore, since what I want is not allowed, nor can I achieve what I desire, I will do what is allowed, that is, I will commend the cause of the wretched to the Lord. And if the prayers of friends for the afflicted and disturbed are believed to have any efficacy with God, I will also intercede for them and earnestly ask that you do the same.</p>
      <p>For there are many who are grieved by these things, as no one is ignorant; but how their troubles can be alleviated except by the prayers of the pious, I do not see at all. Since brotherly love and even the law of nature itself urge this, and you most bravely defend the cause of Christ, I ask again that you take up the cause of our people, since it is the same as Christ's, and intercede with prayers to God for us, etc.</p>
      <p>As for the church of Augsburg, which has retained the gospel with great difficulty, I do not know what to promise myself; yet I see this, unless God Himself finally wishes to plead His own cause, it is not within human strength or help that it can remain with us any longer in such great treachery of men.</p>
      <p>For such is the corruption of morals and life, that little hope is found for those few defending the cause of the gospel. Therefore, it is necessary that the Lord of hosts Himself be present with us, lest we, deprived of such great goods, be reduced to the utmost poverty, etc. The Bishop of Augsburg, as I think you know, has already preached to the people twice, but how well, that is another's judgment. I was present at both sermons. I do not ignore what he said beyond the faith of the matter and truth. For who ever heard that the mass was instituted by the fathers, for thus they speak, and handed down to posterity as if by hand? O distinguished theologian, is this to make faith in words, what prevents him from saying in the same way that all ecclesiastical ceremonies were instituted by Christ Himself? No one is found to contradict or refute the lies. Those who have no knowledge of scripture and truth think it well said. Thus it happens, while no one refutes the lies at the risk of death, others willingly acquiesce to his words, so that the kingdom of the antichrist is restored to its former dignity.</p>
      <p>There is also another monk of the same dregs, who preaches in the main church; he proves fasting with almost the same argument, whose deceit, however, appears less to the untrained, with an argument drawn from the particular to the universal affirmatively. In this way, with no distinction made, he says... "The days of fasting," he says, "if we believe Epiphanius, were instituted by the apostles; for Epiphanius writes the same, that St. Peter appointed fasting on Tuesday and Saturday, and Paul on Friday. Therefore, the days of fasting, which have been in use until now and which were instituted by the apostles, are to be retained in the Christian church." Which he thus proves by the saying of Christ about the authority of the apostles: "He who hears you, hears me, and he who despises you, despises me; therefore, he who rejects fasting, rejects Christ Himself and also the apostles," etc.</p>
      <p>See the man's deceit, how cunningly. O great impudence, who would not notice this kind of fraud, who does not understand the snake lurking in the grass? But he too obtains what he wants without difficulty, for no one dares even to mutter against him. But the Lord knows their impious plans and will surely confound them in their thoughts. But I would wish for us another life and another ardor, lest, stunned by any breeze, we let go of the hope of salvation from our hands, etc. These are, my most learned Lord Bullinger, what I wanted to write to you out of my piety towards you, so that, while our most turbulent times have supplied material for writing about the church of Christ, you might also learn about the antichrist and the papal heresy recently introduced. I would write more, but it would be dangerous to criticize the impostures of those whose hands are already long. But you, with your prudence, can understand the rest from one. You can learn about my affairs from Gesner. The patron does not involve himself in the business of religion, but always exhorts us to true piety.</p>
      <p>The protection of the Landsknechts was dismissed long ago; now we live in the utmost peace, except that the souls of the good are struggling, as usually happens, if we exchange gold for bronze. The prince's arrival from Spain is constantly expected, and those who will go to meet him have already been chosen.</p>
      <p>Whether I will see that pope, I doubt; for the patron threatens us with departure every day. When I learn more or if the present state of my affairs changes, I will inform you as soon as possible. If you wish to write back to me (which I would like), you will send letters to Mr. Andreas Diether, the schoolmaster in Augsburg at St. Anne's; for through him I can safely receive yours. Farewell in Christ; greet your wife, the most honorable woman, and the other brothers, especially Mr. Pellican and Gualter. If I understand that you have taken this negligence of letters in good part, I will not hesitate to send you such signs of friendship in the future. Again, farewell.</p>
      <p>From Augsburg, on the Ides of January, in the year 49.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Kielmann, tutor of the Peutingers.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of Zürich, lord and teacher, especially to be honored.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
