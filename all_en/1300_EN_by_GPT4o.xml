      <p>Greetings. Through Piscator, I wrote to you extensively two days ago about all the news I had, most esteemed lord and godfather, except for one thing that slipped my mind, concerning the Bishop of Chur being detained by the Pope. Our people, at the request of the Rhaetians, are writing to the Pope, and somewhat threateningly: that they are bound to the Rhaetians by some necessity; therefore, it could happen that, unless he releases him, their own people passing through here might also be intercepted.</p>
      <p>A copy of the letter was sent to the Rhaetians, and they were given the freedom to either send the letter to the Pope or suppress it, as they saw fit. While this was being decided in the senate, there was a debate about the title to be given to the Pope; finally, it was agreed to simply write: To Julius III, the Supreme Pontiff of Rome, etc. I would have preferred to write nothing; but I was unaware until everything had already been decided.</p>
      <p>I have nothing from Calvin at the moment. In our France, thieves and poisoners are being severely punished daily, many of whom are continually being caught and punished. The ministers of that province are very restless and harbor great hatred and enmities among themselves. We must pray to the Lord to grant this nation more peaceful dispositions. As for the bearer of this letter, we commend him to all of you, especially to you; he is called A. Vögelin and is sent in place of Elias; he is a very studious young man, of good character and testimony, and of great promise. We wish him to be able to act also with the lord provost; do for him what you are accustomed to do for the rest of our people, and commend him in our name to your other co-ministers and doctors of your church, to whom you should convey my greetings. My family, like Musculus, sends greetings to you and yours.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Bern, May 30, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord and dearest godfather.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
