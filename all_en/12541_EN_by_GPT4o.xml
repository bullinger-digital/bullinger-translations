    <p xml:id="regest1">After reading Haller's last letter [No. 2473], it became clear to Bullinger that he had not yet received some of Haller's letters, which he had already mentioned in his last letter to Haller [not received]. Now, in the last few days, two letters have arrived. Regarding the first letter from June 17 [No. 2462], it is only to be said that it is true that an army is being raised in Italy against the [Protestants], as the envoy Marx Schultheß in Milan confirms. For Emperor [Charles V.], 12,000 Italians are being assembled, for Pope [Paul III.] 1,000. In Genoa, 8,000 Spaniards have landed. The entire army is likely to comprise 20,000 men. But even if it were 100,000, the angel of the Lord has indeed struck down 185,000 Assyrians before Jerusalem. Not the strength of the troops, but God's goodness is decisive for victory!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Yesterday, the letter from June 1 [HBBW XVI, No. 2451, actually from May 31] arrived. The book written by [Sebastian] Coccius [“Refutation of the Twelve Causes”] has been well received by Bullinger. He has already taken note of the nonsensical polemics in [Johannes] Hoffmeister's [“Verbum dei carnem factum... assertio”]. However, he will not respond to this fool. [The Catholics] boast to their bishops when a [Protestant] writes something against them, as it allows them to present themselves as pillars of faith. Bullinger prefers to use his efforts for writing commentaries on the Holy Scriptures. He is currently working on the 15th chapter of the Gospel of Luke, and the 9th chapter is currently being printed. Moreover, in these turbulent times, he is fully occupied with writing letters and receiving many visitors, not to mention preaching.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger has used the detested title "Junker" on the address of a letter [not received] to [Hans Wilpert] Zoller. He intended to grant Zoller more respect among the people to whom he would show the letter, especially since he indeed comes from a respected family and deserves such recognition.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- At the meeting in Baden, the 13 and the allied places are gathered. On the second day of the meeting, the Swiss mercenaries who have joined the army of the [Protestants] and that of the Emperor [Charles V.] were discussed. The nine places Appenzell, Freiburg, Glarus, Lucerne, Schwyz, Solothurn, Unterwalden, Uri, and Zug want to write to Constance and Feldkirch to send these mercenaries back. However, the [four Protestant] places were against it. Consequently, the nine places wrote to the [Zurich] authorities and requested to recall the departed mercenaries. A meeting of the council and citizens of Zurich decided, however, not to recall or punish the mercenaries. This displeases the nine and especially the five places. Yet, the city and region of Zurich are united and steadfast as they have not been for a long time. However, since a large part of the population is willing to offer their services to the [Schmalkaldic League], Zurich would be weakened by this, and it is further believed that the [Protestants] have already been able to recruit enough mercenaries, it was decided today at a council and citizens' meeting not to allow anyone from the city and region of Zurich to leave from now on. Everyone should wait for the [local musters] should they be necessary. This decision will be announced tomorrow. Haller is to inform the [Augsburg mayors] [Hans] Welser, [Jakob] Herbrot, and the city clerk [Georg Frölich], to whom Bullinger cannot write himself.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- In Zurich, it was learned today from Baden about the arrival of the envoys of the Schmalkaldic League from Württemberg [Hans Herter von Hertneck], Strasbourg [Heinrich von Müllenheim], and Constance [Ulrich Hochrütiner]. They are presenting their concerns today. Also, [Girolamo Franco and Albert Rosin], the envoys of Pope [Paul III.], and [Jean Mouchet de Poligny], the representative of [Charles V.], are there and are spending vast sums of money.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Although some places want to call the mercenaries home, Bullinger hopes that they will not return. However, the pension recipients are trying to achieve this return through intrigues. The common people, in any case, are not against the [Schmalkaldic League]. Haller should encourage the Zurichers who have come to Augsburg, among them Heinrich Hermann, Jakob Götthart, and [...] Rüttimann, with words and deeds.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- The Zurich council is currently writing to the council of Basel not to allow the 800 Italians, who want to travel from King [Henry VIII.] of England through Basel and the Confederation to Italy, to pass through.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Greetings, among others, to Frölich. Haller should report on the current situation. [Hans Rych], the bearer of this letter, should be helped by Haller with a messenger's fee.</p>

      <p>May He who has overcome the world grant us grace, strength, fortitude, and victory. From your last letters, I understood that you had sent me some letters which I have not yet received, as I mentioned in my last letter. Now, however, know that I have received two letters in the past few days. The first was sent on June 17, but there is nothing in it that requires a response, except that you are not mistaken when you write that an army is being assembled against us in Italy. For Marcus Schultheß, the envoy to the Leventina, writes the same from Milan. 12,000 Italians are being gathered for the Emperor, 1,000 for the Pope. 8,000 Spaniards have landed in Genoa. I believe the entire army will hardly have 20,000. But even if there were 100,000, the angel of the Lord struck down 185,000 Assyrians before the city of Jerusalem. Victory is not in the multitude or strength of the army, not in horses and artillery, but in the mercy of God. God can save with few as well as with many.</p>

      <p>Now I respond to the second letter dated June 1, which I only received yesterday, July 9. I received the book by Coccius sent through you. I thank you for the gift. In the meantime, I have not been able to examine it, being so disturbed by business. I have also seen the nonsense published against me by Hoffmeister long ago. But I have decided not to respond to a fool. They boast greatly to the bishops if any of us writes against them. For they want to appear as pillars of religion and receive rewards. Therefore, I have decided to better employ my efforts in writing commentaries and illuminating the Holy Scriptures. What have I to do with talkative and unfortunate birds and with the most inept and stupid donkeys? The master reveals himself by his work. I am writing (as you know) on Luke, and I am now beginning to expound chapter 15. They are starting to print chapter 9. I am writing amidst these disturbances, in which I must run about so often, write so many letters, and listen to so many who come, not to mention the sermons to be held.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I wrote to Zoller, giving him the title on the front of the letter, which I otherwise hate. I did not want to flatter him but to gain esteem among those to whom he shows the letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I know how much this title is worth among you. And indeed, he is much more justly adorned with this title than any other, as his parents from both father and mother were truly noble patricians and leaders, having served this city well for more than 100 years.</p>

      <p>There is a meeting in Baden. The 13 places and all allies are present. On the second day of their gathering, they discussed how to conduct themselves in the difficult war. It was mentioned that it is not known how things will turn out, and a large number of people are leaving the country. The nine places Lucerne, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden, Zug, Glarus, Freiburg, Solothurn, and Appenzell have agreed to write to Constance and Feldkirch that neither the empire nor the emperor should take their mercenaries. The other places and confederates did not want to agree to this. Consequently, the nine places wrote to my lords, asking them to help recall those who have run away from the empire and the emperor. Therefore, my lords held a council and citizens' meeting and unanimously decided not to recall them from the empire, knowing well that none of their own had gone to the emperor; there was no need for a recall. The nine places, especially the five, are not well pleased with this. But my lords are steadfast. I have never seen such great unity and seriousness in Zurich in the city and country as now. The imperial cities want to do well by Zurich in the city and country with body and goods. You may say this freely. The mercenaries who have run away will not be punished harshly, etc. No one will be shut out of their house; nothing will be taken from them, etc. It is well mentioned, but the council and citizens do not want it. And know that there has been a considerable movement among the common people, that if nothing is done about it, I think such a large number will run away that we would be left bare. Therefore, today, the council and citizens have again decided not to recall the mercenaries, not to close their houses according to the ordinance, etc., but to be helpful to the empire with all their might. Since a large number have run away, it is generally believed that there are enough people with the empire, it was decided today to announce in the city and country that henceforth everyone should remain in the country by honor and oath, wait for the banner and flag if my lords need it, and that everyone should be armed, etc. This will be announced tomorrow. And so it truly stands. You should inform my lords Welser, Herbrot, and the city clerks, to whom I send my willing service and greetings. I could not write to them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Today, my lords are writing from Baden that the envoys of the league, Württemberg, Strasbourg, and Constance, have arrived, and today they will be heard. May God direct it rightly. The envoys of the Pope and the emperor are also very powerful there. They give out with both hands. I think nothing will come of it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Even if some places want to recall the mercenaries, they are not heeded, and no one returns home, being faithful and honest. For truly, only some pensioners are driving this opposition. The common people in the lands are not unwilling towards the empire. But you know how the oligarchs are. If there are some confederates with you, strengthen them and do them good. For truly, the good, honest fellows are with you, who gladly are with you. If Heini Herman, Jacob Götthart, or Rütimann or other Zurichers have come to you, do them good. There are many who have gone away, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>At this hour, my lords are writing to those of Basel not to allow the troop coming from the king of England, who were stationed in the previous war (there are about 800; they are moving towards Basel; they would like to return through the Confederation to Italy, as they are Italians), not to let them pass through.</p>
      <p>They are well comforted in God, comforting and manly. I trust God, He will not leave us. Greet my Laetus a thousand times. Write, I pray, very frequently, how all things are. Farewell with all good people, whom you will greet in my name.</p>
      <p>Help this messenger with a messenger's fee for this new news.</p>
