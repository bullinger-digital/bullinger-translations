    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger is pleased that his letter [not preserved] was welcome.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Emperor [Charles V] will flatter the [Protestants] until he finds a valid reason to attack them. It is true that he is harassing the Cologne [Archbishop Hermann of Wied] with his mandates. This is also evident from the letter [No. 2419] of a friend [Peter Medmann] and from a printed "transcript" that Bullinger received today from a learned canon of Cologne and Bonn [...].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Duke [Ulrich] of Württemberg has met with the emperor hastening to Regensburg. Nothing is known about the content of their long conversation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- [Charles V] wants to hinder and destroy the Schmalkaldic League. If only some of the league's estates and cities would not waver! In Donauwörth, the emperor was received warmly. The Augsburg councilors sent there, led by the [former] mayors [Hans] Welser and [Jakob] Herbrot, were received by the skillful emperor with wonderful affection and bid farewell with honeyed words. The emperor did not decline an invitation to Augsburg. He allowed the inhabitants of Donauwörth to swear an oath of loyalty to him "by God and the holy Gospel." The emperor has great plans ahead.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Myconius should not immediately share everything entrusted to him by Bullinger with the [Basel] councilors.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- It is true that [Anton] Fugger likes Italy very much. If only the Gospel proclaimed in this language [by Bernardino Ochino] would also please him one day! [But] unfortunately, the merchants worship Mercury, the god [of profit].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- With his [earlier remark about] the "Walchen" [foreigners], Bullinger wanted to admonish the [Basel] people not to let all these treacherous people in.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Last week, the Transylvanian [Antun Vrančić], steward and councilor of Queen Isabella [Jagiellonica], the widow of King John [Zápolya], came to [Zürich] accompanied by a Portuguese [...]. Both recounted how warmly they were received in Basel and that they visited scholars there. They spoke at length with [Konrad] Pellikan and Bullinger about the Lord's Supper. They are on their way to Trent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Bullinger is currently exhausted from much preaching. Since he has been in Zürich, prayer services, sermons, and communion celebrations have never been better attended than now.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace. I am truly delighted, my most esteemed Myconius, that my letters are most welcome to you. This arises from your singular love towards me. May the Lord Jesus increase His true love in us.</p>

      <p>The Emperor will flatter our people for a while until he finds a just occasion to unleash his long-desired wrath. It is entirely true, as you write, that the Emperor is harassing the Archbishop of Cologne with severe mandates. Today, I received a printed "transcript," as they call it, from a learned canon of Cologne and Bonn, along with a letter from a friend, declaring that the Emperor is extremely angry both with the Archbishop of Cologne and with all the evangelicals. Indeed, he needs no witnesses, as his deeds are sufficiently monstrous.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The Duke of Württemberg received the Emperor, who was hastening to Regensburg, with the highest honors. They conversed for a long time. About what matters, it is uncertain.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Emperor is entirely focused on either hindering or dissolving the Schmalkaldic League through cunning. And if only some of the estates or cities of that league would not waver today; but no more about this now. When he came to Donauwörth on the Danube, he was received most amicably. Several Augsburg councilors, led by the former mayors Welser and Herbrot, had gone there to greet his majesty. The Emperor, being very cunning, received them with wonderful affection and dismissed them with the sweetest words. They invited him to Augsburg. He replied that once the diet was concluded, if his affairs allowed, he would come, promising everything. The next day, he demanded an oath from the citizens of Donauwörth, and when they cited religion as a reason, the Emperor did not argue about the form, but demanded this form: "So help me God and the holy Gospel." Thus he departed. We await what he will accomplish; for he is attempting great things.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>However, my Myconius, I would not want you to immediately share everything I entrust to you with the councilors for certain reasons.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>You rightly judge that the Italian language pleases Fugger. If only the Gospel, which is preached in this language, would please him someday! Merchants have Mercury, the god of profit, as their guardian deity, whom they both worship and imitate. You understand what I mean. Regarding the "Walchen," I mean that you should not let all these treacherous and wicked people always and everywhere among you, lest they bring you some disgrace. They are full of deceit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Last week, the Transylvanian steward and councilor of Queen Isabella, the widow of King John, came to us, accompanied by a Portuguese, and they discussed many things about the Eucharist with Pellikan and me. They are heading to Trent. They said they had also been in Basel and visited the learned, and they praised your hospitality.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I had to hurry. Therefore, consider these few words kindly. Live and farewell. I am so exhausted from preaching these days that I am utterly weary. Never, as long as I have been in Zürich, have I seen the church more frequented in prayers, sermons, and the Lord's Supper than now. Farewell again.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>In Zürich, April 26, at 4 in the afternoon, 1546. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, the most faithful overseer of the Basel church, my brother and lord, always to be esteemed in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel.</p>
