      <p>Greetings. Most humane man, Guido delivered your letters to me, speaking many good things about you and all others there. These days, a certain German merchant coming from Italy passed through here. He whispered to our consul that the Pope had already prepared an army of several thousand and is said to be attacking Tuscany and Naples.</p>
      <p>But in Tuscany and the Kingdom of Naples, no soldiers are being prepared; everything is in the deepest peace, and nothing is feared, nor is there any talk of war, from which it can be sufficiently understood that the Pope is preparing forces against others, and it is thought by the shrewd that this army will be sent to his friends, I do not know which ones. It is useful to know this, but not to speak of it. Whatever it is, I wanted you to know. Meanwhile, Comander has recovered and sends his regards to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, greatest man, and continue to love your Philipp. From Chur, the penultimate day of August 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours in all humanity, Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all good people. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
