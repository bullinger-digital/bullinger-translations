    <p xml:id="regest1">The Zurich native Konrad Klauser fully matched Bullinger's description during his stay in [Isny]: While staying with Frick, he translated the first book of the Greek [author] Theophilos to Autolykos from Greek into Latin; he is eloquent, a good preacher of the [Holy] Scripture, and pleasant in interaction. However, they could not agree on the salary; he will report on this himself. Frick thanks Bullinger in the meantime for sending Klauser, with which Bullinger complied with [Isny's] request.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace from God. What you, most learned man, have testified in your most welcome letter to me about Mr. Konrad Klauser from Zurich, he has fulfilled beautifully in every respect when he arrived here. Namely, that he is learned in Greek and Latin, not commonly educated in divine and human letters, humane and faithful; which was easily discernible from many arguments: For in the meantime, when he lived with me, he translated the first book of the Greek Theophilos to Autolykos from Greek into Latin, eloquent to the point of wonder in daily conversation, practiced in preaching the scriptures, exceedingly pleasant in interaction, as nothing was lacking of those things you asserted about him; this was also clearly perceived by our people. But how it happened that he could not agree with our people on the salary, he will narrate himself. In the meantime, I give you the most abundant thanks on behalf of our entire church, for sending him to us, compelled by our prayers.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord as happily as possible and always love me, though unknown by face, yet very well known in spirit.</p>
      <p>Given in Isny, on the 15th day of October in the year 1545 after Christ's birth. Yours, Konrad Frick, preacher in Isny.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zurich, always to be revered by him. Zurich.</p>
