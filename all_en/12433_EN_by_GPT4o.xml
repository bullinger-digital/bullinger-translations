    <p xml:id="regest1">For several reasons, Hospinian's letters to Bullinger are becoming rarer. On one hand, Hospinian hears that Bullinger is very busy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- On the other hand, he himself has a lot to do. Among other things, he is currently giving two demanding lectures on Cicero.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Additionally, the [Zurichers], to whom he would gladly entrust letters, do not consider him worthy of a visit. He met Rudolf Gwalther only by chance in Basel, and Gwalther did not even share the reason for his visit, so Hospinian had to learn from other professors that the Zurichers planned to send Huldrych Zwingli's son [Huldrych Zwingli the Younger] and another [Josias Simler] to Basel. Subsequently, Johannes Wolf came, who also did not visit Hospinian. Rudolf Kopp and Johann Felix Renner were also in Basel without visiting him. Thus, Hospinian is considered a nobody. He knows who [Oswald Myconius?] is responsible for this. However, he also knows that he has done nothing to deserve such contempt.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The reasons outlined will surely reassure Bullinger if he misses Hospinian's letters. He should know that Hospinian values the Zurichers, honors them, and wishes to assist them; indeed, he shares their faith in all respects and even has to endure some things in Basel because of it. And yet, he is shunned like a leper by several Zurichers! His patron [Kaspar] Megander is no longer alive; likewise, his teacher and relative Johannes Rhellikan. Recently, he learned that Erasmus Schmid has also passed away!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- If it weren't for Bullinger and a few other people, the Zurichers would have long since written him off. However, Bullinger should know that Hospinian is deeply obliged to him not only in words but also from the heart and would gladly be of service. The wise Bullinger will surely understand why he writes this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- As a small gift, he now sends the abridged edition [of the Greek grammar] by Urbano [Valeriani] that he has edited. He hopes to soon be able to send Bullinger a larger work. He has given up his medical studies to devote himself entirely to theology.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- He sends greetings to Bullinger's wife [Anna, n√©e Adlischwyler] and their children, as well as to Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Pellikan, and the other colleagues.</p>

      <p>Greetings through Christ the Lord. For many reasons, my letters to you, most esteemed Bullinger, have become rarer. I understand that you are a man entangled in very serious affairs. Why then should I interrupt you with my trifles?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Now, my own occupations, both private and public, are not insignificant, as you know, since I am appointed to two very difficult lectures on Cicero. Hence, it is not always possible for me, even when I wish, to write to good friends and brothers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Additionally, those through whom I would most like to write do not consider me worthy of a visit. How many of your people, even those with whom I think I have a friendship, when they come here, usually visit and greet me? Recently, Rudolf Gwalther was here, and if I had not happened upon him almost by chance, I would not have had the opportunity to meet him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Yet he did not consider me worthy to discuss anything regarding the matter for which he came. All the professors knew that you were going to send us two young men, Huldrych Zwingli the Younger, of blessed memory, and another one. I alone, when asked, was found to be ignorant. Not long after, Johannes Wolf also came here, whom I considered to be a very good friend. But did he greet me? Johannes Rudolf Kopp and Felix Renner were also here. Neither of them approached me. These and others like them are the ones through whom I would undoubtedly write not only to you but also to others. But I am disregarded and despised by them; nor am I unaware of who has brought me into this contempt. Yet thanks be to God, I am conscious of no reason why I should be so deservedly despised by them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>But if you are grieved that I do not write to you more frequently, you can certainly attribute it to them. For although I am rightly disposed towards all of you, although I am in complete agreement with you in all matters of religion, and have therefore suffered not a little, although I am of the same city as you, that is, Zurich, and finally, although I think and sincerely wish to consult for the glory and benefit of all of you, yet I see that some of you shun me and flee from me as if I were a leper. My greatest supporter, Kaspar Megander, has died, and before him, my most esteemed teacher and relative, Johannes Rhellikan, and, as I hear, not long ago, Erasmus Schmid also passed away.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I would undoubtedly be erased from your book, as far as I can conjecture, if you, most excellent Bullinger, and a few others did not still (as I hope) love me and not consider me entirely worthless; whom I, in turn, hold in high regard not only with my words but with my heart, and will carry in my eyes as long as I live. I pray you by the cross of our Lord, do not consider me a man who has something ready on his tongue other than what is hidden in his heart; by which I also testify that I always think and speak well of all of you. Therefore, if others do not wish to use my friendship and service, use it yourself, and you will find me, if not suitable in all things, yet ready and faithful, and you will never regret it. I believe you, a most wise man, understand why I write this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>What remains, I send to you here the abridged edition of Urbano [Valeriani] that I have compiled, which the most learned men have urged me to publish. I send it not because I think you need such elementary booklets, but to testify to my goodwill towards you. It will be your part to receive this small paper gift with a serene face, until not long after, something greater is brought to you, if Christ favors my undertakings. I have dedicated and devoted myself entirely to sacred theology, having abandoned the study of medicine. Therefore, pray to the Lord for me, that He may impart to me the spirit of His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, and grant me His grace so that I may proceed to the glory of His name and the growth of His church. Farewell happily in the Lord Jesus. Greet your wife and children, Theodor Bibliander, Konrad Pellikan, your schoolmasters, and the other brothers on my behalf.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely (as you know), entirely Johannes Hospinianus.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man in divine and human letters, Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church of Zurich, his lord and patron in Christ, to be revered.</p>
