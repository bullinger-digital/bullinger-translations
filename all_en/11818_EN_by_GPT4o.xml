    <p xml:id="regest1">Received Bullinger's letter from March 1st. The Brabant-Cleves war brings great inflation; the Duke of Cleves [Wilhelm of Jülich] has, with God's help, occupied Amersfoort and is also said to have taken Breda, yet the Imperial forces continue to persecute the Church; the Regent [of the Netherlands, Maria of Hungary] is under the influence of the theologians of Leuven and has had visitors of [Protestant] services executed after Easter; the theologians cannot tolerate the contradiction from laypeople. In [East] Frisia, where the God-fearing [Countess Anna] rules, a pious Pole [Johannes a Lasco] leads the Church, but the Anabaptists from Belgium who have been taken in here prove to be obstinate and endanger the Church. Rejoices over Bullinger's health and regrets the death of Leo [Jud], whose catechism is appreciated here and whose Passion history was expected; welcomes the new Bible edition [„Biblia sacrosancta“], which he has not yet seen; has seen [Bullinger's] commentary on Matthew, but not yet read it; the commentary on John is eagerly awaited by many. Would wish to send one of his three sons to Zurich for education. Requests an occasional letter; relies on the works of scholars and especially Bullinger's; struggles daily with the Anabaptists; apologizes for his confused writing.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>Finally, I received the letters written on the first of March and sent from Cologne on the 7th of July, most excellent of friends.</p>
      <p>The unfortunate Brabant-Cleves war with the Duke of Cleves brings all calamity to these lands, so that hardly anything remains for the poor to eat; such is the scarcity of rye here. God now favors the Cleves against the House of Burgundy, which has so far despised God and men; thus they are compelled to recognize that they are men and that God exists. Various troubles afflict the Cleves. They have captured the very strong town in the diocese of Utrecht named Amersfoort, three miles from Lower Utrecht, which they are fortifying with bulwarks to defend themselves; for it is close to the borders of Gelderland. Moreover, a persistent rumor continues that the Cleves (who now govern Gelderland) have taken Breda with strong force; it is indeed a unique town in Brabant, which rightly returns the county with its subjected fields. The Imperial forces are dismayed, as everything falls out unfortunately, lacking counsel, yet they do not cease to persecute the Church, lest they be found inconstant in their troubles. Unfortunate things are whispered about the Emperor; those who speak out are punished with death; thus we play in these regions. The theologians of Leuven persist strongly in their institution and do not send a jot of what they have conceived, so that they preach indulgences, candles, and parentalia without shame after a decade. What can I say, except that the death of Pharaoh is imminent after such great darkness? Yet the Queen, the Emperor's sister, the governor of these regions, executes everything vigorously according to the counsel and judgment of these blind, insane people. After Easter, those who celebrated, visited temples daily, and about whom no one had anything bad to say, were burned, drowned, or stabbed alive. What do I want? The theologians are mad when they see their glory obscured and are reproved by laypeople; but this is their hour and the power of darkness.</p>
      <p>Here in Frisia, we are quite well, which we now conduct under the best princess, a God-fearing widow, and by divine favor, we have acquired a noble, pious, and learned Polish man who governs the Church of Frisia in the name of the princess as bishop; but the Anabaptists, who have come here in large numbers from Belgian Gaul, having been driven out from there, cause trouble for everyone, not without annoyance. The rulers, hoping for the repentance of the wretched (they first proclaim themselves wretched and desolate), moved by mercy, received them; now received, they persist more strongly, a new kind of Jews, which is not bent by any warnings, but daily, like a flock, the more numerous they are, the more burdensome they are to their neighbors, and unless God singularly looks upon us, they will infect this whole province. If only someone would apply a healthy remedy!</p>
      <p>Having been defeated, they proclaim themselves victorious, detest our church as impure, mock sermons and ministers, have their own teachers and gatherings, yet secretly.</p>
      <p>They cannot be expelled without a crowd, and if they persist in this way, this pestilence will infect the whole body. These are about the unfortunate war and our Frisia.</p>
      <p>Now a few words about your letters. I rejoice that you are well with yours, but I grieve that Leo, a faithful minister, has been taken from his church. The catechism of the man is praised by everyone here. The memory of the Lord's Passion promised at the end of the catechism was expected. Moreover, I rejoice over the Bible that has been published, long desired, which I have not yet been able to see; I hope for all your works from these fairs. I saw one copy of the commentaries on Matthew, but did not read it; many desire the one on John, which you promised. Continue, most excellent of men, to cultivate the Lord's vineyard and drive out the foxes that demolish it.</p>
      <p>I, broken by old age, am making my will, although there is nothing of fortune; yet I have three poor sons, who now begin to bend and vex letters; I would like to provide for them out of paternal affection. If only I were nearer to Zurich; I would send a young man beautiful in face and most beautiful in talent, small in stature, great in spirit, so that he might imbibe piety and good morals there; but these are not to be hoped for.</p>
      <p>Finally, I would like you to write a few words sometimes, especially at the fairs, about how you are doing, what you are working on. We here depend on the abundance of learned men, especially yours. It is your duty to abundantly provide and nurture the rational milk for your sons (since you have received it generously). As you know, I have moved to another more renowned place, where I have to contend daily with the most obstinate Anabaptists.</p>
      <p>These things, I pray, consider kindly, most delightful of friends, which I have vomited out as if into a mouth, content to have indicated my mind, not at all concerned with composition. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Emden, the day before the Assumption of the Virgin, in the year 1543. Hermann Aquilomontanus, minister of the Church of the House of the Old Men near Emden, most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant minister of the Zurich Church, his greater in the Lord. To Zurich.</p>
