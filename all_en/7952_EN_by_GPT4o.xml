      <p>Greetings. I have much to write, and I should also send back Rami and other letters that you sent me through Leon, the son of Coelius; but I do not have time now, as my gracious lord, the Count of Culemborg, is ready to depart and has already had his horse led to the gate, and he is waiting for me to write you a word. He is coming from Geneva, and with him, you will learn what news there is from there. One thing I cannot withhold is that on the 2nd of this month, FÃ¼glinus came from Basel, under the guise of a table companion from here, whom he had with him. He brought a heap of letters from Sultzer to many of my lords, also to particular citizens; think well what the matter might be. We kept company with him; then he (as is his custom) broke out during the meal and declaimed against the foreigners (and did not obscurely let it be known that he was here for that reason, although he later denied it, and early in the morning greeted Tun) to such an extent that we could not endure it, but openly contradicted him and admonished him to discretion. It almost came to a scuffle; for he seemed very angry. Yet he does not want to be like Sultzer, and before his departure today, he sent me this attached note.</p>
      <p>Let me have it back as soon as possible. As for the strangers, we otherwise know well that one must be cautious; but the example of Gentilis and others, should it come to that, will teach them well to keep quiet. These things hastily. I ask that you consider everything favorably.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 5.</p>
      <p>With this count, you have seen nothing more humane.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, wholly and always yours. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
