      <p>Pious, honorable, etc. My willing service and all good things beforehand. I thank you very kindly for your diligent writing, it also has an appearance of truth.</p>
      <p>In return, I am sending you enclosed a copy of a letter; a man from Lucerne is said to have sent it out of the camp. The copy was given to me by my friendly, dear brother-in-law Heinrich Berckher, now the new host at the Stork; from him I have it. And when I asked him if I might send it to you, he replied: "Yes, very well; for I intend to send it to the Bäldis (your dear sons); so you send it directly to the father and greet them kindly for me with the offer of my very willing services." That I want to have accomplished hereby.</p>
      <p>From Strasbourg, it is heard that their bishop has died and the canons have fallen into discord over the election, coming into disagreement. This is unpleasant for the city, somewhat concerning in terms of politics, especially since Aumale is lying with a strong force of cavalry and infantry near Metz; therefore, the city of Strasbourg is hiring soldiers for their protection, etc. At this time, I have nothing further to know.</p>
      <p>God be with you. Greet yours and all good gentlemen and friends for me.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich in haste on the day of Charles in the year 1569. Yours, etc.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable lord Joachim Bäldi, former Landammann (chief magistrate) of Glarus, my gracious, dear lord.</p>
      <p>Glarus.</p>
