      <p>Greetings. It is written to me from Bellinzona that the people of Casale are being harassed by unjust exactions, and that the Mantuan authority has been resisted. Consequently, with the spirits of the populace stirred to arms, they have summoned a band of soldiers from the neighboring fields and towns.</p>
      <p>The Viceroy of Milan sent a legate, Nicolaus Madruzzo, who settled the matter without much trouble, so that the privileges of the people of Casale would be preserved intact and inviolate in good faith, the people of Casale would again pledge their loyalty to the Mantuan, and they would not be allowed to have any weapon at home except a traveler's sword.</p>
      <p>The Pope was said to be about to enlist six thousand foot soldiers in the Milanese territory; but it is written that this matter is being handled coldly. Nothing further; the letters were written in Italian, therefore I do not send them.</p>
      <p>In the Grisons, all is quite peaceful, and better is hoped for daily.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, P[omponne] Belli√®vre.</p>
