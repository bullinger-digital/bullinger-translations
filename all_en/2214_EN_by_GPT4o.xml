      <p>I have no doubt, most esteemed brothers, that you have long been eager to hear something about us, ever since we left England after our churches there were scattered.</p>
      <p>But you can also believe that we, in turn, have had no less desire to write to you during this whole time, if we could have done so in any way, not only to relieve your concern for us, which we do not doubt is great due to your piety, but also to have your prayers and sighs joined with ours all the more fervently, and finally to be instructed and further strengthened by you in our troubles and struggles, which our Lord God has willed to test and exercise us for the glory of His Son, as I hope; to Him be glory forever. Amen. Since we have not been able to do this until now, and now someone offers to carry our letters to Strasbourg, and we do not doubt that they will easily reach you from there, I could not refrain from writing to you all there through these letters, hastily indeed, as time allowed, but meanwhile diligently and dutifully from the heart, to greet you as most beloved brothers and also to inform you of the success and all the circumstances of our Danish journey, so that you may now finally join us in giving thanks to our Lord God for His divine kindness and mercy towards us, who has never failed us in our troubles and struggles, but has stood by us powerfully and has illustrated His divine power in our weakness.</p>
      <p>I am sending you an account of our journey, up to the point when we were dismissed, not to say expelled, by the King of Denmark, in which you will see how our opponents in the doctrine of the sacraments have dealt with us, and you will easily understand what their nature is, what integrity they have, and what all the pious should expect from them. May the Lord forgive them and grant them by His grace to repent at some point.</p>
      <p>The rest of our journey is not yet completed, nor can I complete it until those who are still scattered elsewhere come to us. Our Martin Micronius is with a good part of our scattered church in Wismar in the Duchy of Mecklenburg, others are in Lübeck, others in Hamburg, but all will soon come here. However, I have not decided whether I want to stay here, but I will wait until all of ours gather, who perhaps will no longer need my ministry here; for they will join this church, which otherwise has its own ministers, so that I hope to be free.</p>
      <p>A pastor in Hamburg, Joachim Westphal, has written a pamphlet against us all in general, filled with lies and insults, in which, however, there is nothing that has not been said before by others, and indeed more successfully. I am also sending it to you, in case any of you there might want to respond to it; for I truly do not have the time now. However, I would like it to be answered, not so much for his sake as for the sake of others who depend on him. He has also issued a collection of interpretations on the words of the supper, gathered from the writings of Karlstadt, Zwingli, Oecolampadius, Peter Martyr, Bucer, your confession against Luther, Bullinger, Calvin, and finally from my own little book; but I intend to respond to this, if the Lord grants grace. Moreover, after my departure, some things have begun to be mixed in here by some, which I hope will be easily corrected. They urge the Bucerian presentation, which not even Bucer himself could understand, much less could it be proven with any solid testimonies or reasons. But more on this later. Such is the burden, indeed, of removing that prodigious imagination, the parent of all papal idolatry, of the presence of the body of Christ in the ceremony itself and the elements of the supper.</p>
      <p>However, I hope that soon it will be completely removed from the minds of all the pious. There are again those who think I disagree with you, because I deny that the bread and wine in the supper itself are signs of the supper, which you teach are symbols of the body and blood of Christ, as if the supper itself were not one thing, and the body and blood of Christ another, so that, even if the bread and wine are not signs of the supper, they can nonetheless be symbols of the body and blood of Christ. Indeed, when I teach that the distribution and participation of the bread in the supper is a sign of the supper, I also teach that the bread and wine in the supper are symbols of the body and blood of Christ. Otherwise, the distribution of the bread and cup in the supper could not be a sign of our communion with Christ in His body and blood, if the bread and wine were not symbols of the body and blood of Christ. But they love to hunt for and sow dissensions where there are none, while they themselves are never consistent.</p>
      <p>I cannot write more now. I commend myself and my scattered church to your common prayers and wish you all well and happy in the Lord. Emden, Friesland, March 6, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, as much as I am, Johannes a Lasco, by my own hand.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed brothers in the Lord, the ministers of the Church of Zürich, Heinrich Bullinger, Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, Konrad Gessner, and all their colleagues, to their hands.</p>
