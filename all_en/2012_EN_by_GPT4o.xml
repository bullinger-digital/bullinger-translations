      <p>Greetings. I will write about that discipline another time. For, to freely confess the truth, I have not yet read what you sent about it. The affair of Servetus has me worried. I have known him not by face, but through his books for more than 20 years. If the people of Geneva do their duty, they will treat him as a blasphemer deserves. For he is not simply guilty of heresy, but of extreme blasphemy against the majesty of God. I think that by God's providence he fled to Geneva, so that by taking action against him, they may clear themselves of the crime of blasphemy and heresy among many. But I hear that they are defending that most profane scoundrel, perhaps out of hatred for Calvin.</p>
      <p>From Germany, we have no certain news, except that councils are being held in Heilbronn, where many princes are trying to settle the war between the margrave and the bishops. Live and farewell with your family.</p>
