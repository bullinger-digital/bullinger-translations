    <p xml:id="regest1">Regarding the outcome of Bucer's negotiations with Melanchthon, he confidentially shares a letter [Bucer's to Frecht] with him. Although Luther found nothing condemnable in the formula of agreement, Philipp [Melanchthon] has been instructed by the Elector [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony to seek the opinion of Johannes Agricola, Osiander, Linck, Brenz, and Amsdorf, while Bucer will again reach out to the pastors and authorities of the cities; this will be discussed, among other things, at the meeting in Esslingen [on March 7]. At the theologians' meeting in Constance, the participants approved nothing that went beyond the statements in Bucer's "Ad Monasterienses," but they also found that the Zurich [Communion] confession probably did not suffice for Luther; Bucer presented articles with a view to reaching an agreement with Luther, which he definitely wanted to discuss with Bullinger. He requests confidential treatment of the enclosures. News: Nuremberg has joined the Land Peace Alliance [of Ferdinand], while Ulm wants to stay out due to religious reservations; he has preached about it. Bullinger should reassure Christoph [Froschauer] until Schuler can pay. He will have large expenses with the expected birth of a child. He will send the shoemaker the money as soon as he knows the amount owed. Greetings. A meeting [concerning the Swabian League] is planned in Ulm. - [Enclosure (Bucer's letter to Frecht, January 2, 1535):] In the [Kassel] formula of agreement, which Bucer sends to Ulm, Esslingen, Biberach, Memmingen, Kempten, and Isny, only the Augsburgers are mentioned because they are still suspected [of Zwinglian heresy] by the Elector. He hopes that Philipp [Melanchthon] will be supported in his efforts to gain Luther's approval [by the cities], as the prospects for an agreement have never been so good; he will report further as soon as he knows more. He asks for approval of the enclosed text, which - to preserve the purity of doctrine - explains and establishes the distinction between bread and the body of Christ [in the Communion]. Philipp [Melanchthon] and some Hessians send their regards. - Agreement between Philipp [Melanchthon] and Bucer in Kassel on December 29, 1534. Schuler asks Bullinger to assess this formula but not to spread it.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your letter on February 6, dearest brother, in which you wish to know from me what our Bucer has achieved with Melanchthon and Luther. But since I had not yet understood anything about this matter, I wanted to write to you after certain investigations. It is true, immediately after Bucer's departure to Melanchthon, Frechtus, my very own bishop of the Ulm church, a man both pious and learned, sent me and the other colleagues Bucer's autograph, which I wanted to share with you in good faith, not to show others, but to keep it with you so that you can carry this matter more successfully.</p>
      <p>Much later, on February 27, 1535, I received another letter from my Frechtus, in which, among other things, he informed me: "You may not be unaware," to recount Frechtus's words, "what the Elector of Saxony replied with Luther to those things that Melanchthon and our Bucer recently discussed in Kassel before the Landgrave in the cause of concord. Luther, with the theologians of Wittenberg, openly confessed that they could not condemn us in our opinion. If there is nothing condemnable in it, it follows that it is free from falsehood. However, at the Elector's command, Philipp will ask the opinions of some leading preachers, such as Islebii, Osiander, Linck, Brenz, and Amsdorf, on our moderation; and again, our Bucer will ask for our opinions and those of the leading senators of the cities; then, by God's grace, concord will fully and completely come together. And about this matter, the delegates of the cities will perhaps meet in Esslingen, where they will hold the next joyful assembly." This is from Frechtus, etc.</p>
      <p>When we were in Constance, we approved nothing in the cause of the Eucharist other than what Bucer's writing to the Monasterians has on this matter. After reading your true confession with great zeal, we finally burst into this opinion (I speak into your bosom): "The Swiss or Zurich brothers have written very truly about the matter of the Eucharist, perhaps not clearly enough for Luther." For we saw that the matter differed in the manner of speaking, not in the thing itself, etc. If only I had the leisure to speak in person. Bucer proposed certain articles to us, indicating how we might agree with Luther without sacrificing the truth, which I would very eagerly and to the point of satiety wish to discuss with you.</p>
      <p>It is not very safe to dispatch these things by letters, especially in this wicked age, where not even a guest is safe from a host. I hope you will not read these things to your disadvantage, not because Bucer loves such articles, but to try with these means among us, who preside over the Swabian churches, wherever we might come together with Luther. Meanwhile, accept in good faith what I send, and weigh it with the prudence given to you, lest I be accused as a revealer of secrets.</p>
      <p>The following are new and true: Those from Nuremberg have joined the alliance; may God bless them in the protest[...]. Those from Ulm also want to join, but with some reserved articles, one of which is that the alliance should not have anything to do with religious matters, and if something adverse happens to them concerning religious matters, then the bishops and prelates should also be steadfast in protecting the gospel for them. O fleshly hearts, foolish prudence! How that Satan bends himself into a thousand forms. Yes, say those from Ulm, we know well that the Roman king's majesty cannot accept such a proposal along with the priests, so we can then come to them with a trick, etc. But it is called tempting God when one deals with patchwork and does not hold to simple truth and justice. The sly cats are not good to tempt; the offspring always knows how to slip its head out of the halter. As if the priests would accept such a proposal, and when it came to necessity, one would first need a special interpreter for the made alliance with its conditions, and if everyone strolled over it with their own will, we would be lost. I have preached one or two excellent sermons against it in Memmingen; I hope God has improved it for our sake. Nothing then, let our church be commended to you in your prayer.</p>
      <p>Further, I ask you for the sake of the common love we bear together, to hold Stoffel a little longer; he shall lose nothing; I will pay him honorably as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>I will soon have a godchild, which also runs a special cost on me.</p>
      <p>I do not know the shoemaker's sum in truth; I wanted to send it to him. When I am informed of it, I will send it to him.</p>
      <p>I write in haste, forgive me, my brother, hold my rare writing in good esteem and let me be commended to you in the Lord henceforth as before.</p>
      <p>Greet your dear wife, your mother, Leonem Jude with all the brothers.</p>
      <p>Given on March 4, 1535.</p>
      <p>A day will be held in Ulm by the knighthood and nobility.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius Schuler.</p>
      <p>O Grace and peace, venerable Frechtus.</p>
      <p>I send to you and the brothers in Esslingen, Biberach, Memmingen, Kempten, and Isny a reason by which the efforts of the enemies seeking a cause from our dissension can presently be averted. It seemed good to the most illustrious Landgrave, Philipp, and me, that only the Augsburgers be mentioned, because we were long ago recognized as concordant by the Saxon, when he first received our confession in Augsburg and we later received theirs in Schweinfurt. Therefore, no indication was to be given that anything still did not agree between us, as indeed it agrees in all things, except that some still stick to certain modes of speaking. However, the Augsburgers were particularly defamed before the most illustrious prince elector; therefore, we have set forth the reason for concord concerning them by name, which Philipp will say is approved by all of us. For since nothing is given here except that we teach according to the confession, and the explanation that is added expresses nothing but the true exhibition of Christ and excludes no explanation, it does not seem that anything here can burden any of us. Lord Philipp indeed approves our moderation in the book "Ad Monasterienses," where everything is sufficiently explained, it remains whole for each one in his church to explain everything for edification, only that the true exhibition of the true Christ through the ministerial ministry remains safe. As I always said, Philipp will make an effort that Lord Luther also approves our explanation. The impious have nothing to do with us; therefore, nothing was seen to be determined about them by name. Therefore, dearest brothers, persevere in the moderation that is in the booklet "Ad Monasterienses," so that you fully confess the Lord is exhibited to us, and pray to the Lord that Philipp's efforts, which are the best, may be advanced and confirmed. Never was there a more certain and purer hope of concord. However, as soon as Philipp writes back to us what he has achieved with the Elector and Luther, I will inform you.</p>
      <p>The writing, which I send, is commonly set by us, do not publish it and recognize in it diligently the caution about the natural distinction between bread and the body of the Lord. For with this set, all gross and impure thoughts are averted, how the body of the Lord is perceived by itself, namely by a faithful mind and by the reason of the sacrament. "Bodily, bodily" is presently deferred for reasons. In general, it was previously established that it is necessary to explain the diversity of nature between the body of the Lord and the bread by exhibition and clearly.</p>
      <p>Things are going well; only pray to the Lord and accommodate yourselves to concord according to what you have received from the book "Ad Monasterienses." What Philipp has achieved with the Elector and Luther, he will write back to the Landgrave as soon as possible; from this, we will learn best.</p>
      <p>Farewell, esteemed brothers.</p>
      <p>Frankfurt, the day after the Circumcision, 1535.</p>
      <p>Philipp and some brothers from Hesse have asked with great zeal to be commended to you.</p>
      <p>Martin Bucer sent this letter to Frechtus, Frechtus to us, etc.</p>
      <p>Agreed between Philipp and Bucer in Kassel on December 29, 1534:</p>
      <p>Mr. Bucer has been in Augsburg for five weeks, preached there, and achieved that the preachers promised the authorities to teach according to the sacrament and other articles of the confession and apology. They had also previously offered this at the instigation of the authorities, as they always indicated, and that no deception is sought or meant, that the true report of the true presence of Christ is contrary, yes, they confess that the body of Christ is essentially and truly received when the sacrament is received, and that bread and wine are signs, signa exhibitiva, which when rightly and received, the body of Christ is simultaneously given and received. And they hold that the bread and the body are thus together, not with a mixture of their essence, but as a sacrament and that which is given with the sacrament (quo posito aliud ponitur); for since they hold on both parts that bread and wine remain, they hold such a sacramental conjunction, etc.</p>
      <p>Write back, my brother, whether this formula of concord pleases you; meanwhile, do not divulge it openly.</p>
