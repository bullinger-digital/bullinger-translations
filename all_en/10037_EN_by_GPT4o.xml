      <p>To his Michael, grace and peace.</p>
      <p>We send to you, dear Michael, our letter, which concerning the Eucharist was issued a few days ago before it was written, if perhaps through it God grants you eyes, so that having recognized the impiety of the Mass, you may consider how you can soon change your habits, studies, gain, and life, and still be in such a spacious world where you can live, with a better conscience, than in the most impious gain and idolatry. For indeed, you still have a sound mind in a sound body. You have nothing after infidelity by which you can protect yourself; you have offended the Lord more than enough. Therefore, return to Him, who does not want "the death of the sinner, but rather that he should turn and live" [Ez 33:11], and take our concern for you in good part. For I could not bear to be separated from you in religion, who not only by blood, but from the cradle have been most closely bound to you throughout life. As for the forms of the letters, do not be an Aristarchus; for thus one of my young men took these down as quickly as possible at my dictation, and I scarcely had leisure to read them over, let alone to correct countless errors.</p>
      <p>Farewell and act in such a way that I may understand you prefer to be a poor Christian, than a rich impious, unbelieving, slaughterer.</p>
      <p>From our monastery, December 16, 1525.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich.</p>
