      <p>Greetings. I received your letter along with Lentulus's letter and two crowns, and I thank you very much for your efforts and labors, which I will repay if I can at an opportune time. Tell Mr. Tobias, our fellow minister and beloved brother, that I received his letter written on the 4th of September and that I have nothing specific to write to him now, except that I have diligently taken care of the letter sent by Mr. Consul from Cham through Mr. Friderych von Salis; if he informs Friderych of this, he will do me a great favor. Otherwise, I do not have the leisure to write to him now. Bid both of them farewell and wish them well; and you will have common matters with them. Cardinal von Santa Croce is hastening from Rome through Lyon to the king's court to persuade him, or rather the queen, on whom everything depends, to accept the decrees of the Council of Trent.</p>
      <p>There they say that the king of Spain himself or his splendid delegation is expected to do the same. For the Spaniard is certainly striving with all his might to subject everyone to the seat to which he willingly submits. If the pope achieves this, he will have caused new disturbances in France. The papal legate, Cardinal Ferrara, brought civil war to France in 1562. What if Cardinal Crucianus brings the cross into France and renews the internal war? Therefore, we must pray to the Lord to cast down the disturbers of peace and preserve peace. Yesterday, the envoys of the Duke of Savoy and the Republic of Geneva arrived here. It was agreed between them to present their dispute to six arbitrators for resolution. They will therefore request from our republic the consul from Cham; they will also request from the people of Lucerne the elder Pfyffer, the bailiff Arnold from Uri, and Reding from Schwyz, and two more from the republics of Basel and Schaffhausen. The Bernese returned three bailiwicks to the Duke in the presence of the Swiss envoys.</p>
      <p>Everything was settled peacefully. May the outcome meet the wishes of the pious! The envoys of 27 princes are in Vienna and are asking the emperor to release the captive Saxon prince to them. We are waiting to hear what is written from Frankfurt, from where no one has yet returned.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently. Greet the consuls and Captain Karl, especially the royal majesty's envoy to the Rhaetians, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 19th of September, 1567.</p>
      <p>Bullinger the elder, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most upright man, Mr. Johannes Pontisella, senator of Chur, my singular friend and most beloved brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
