      <p>Greetings, most beloved Doctor and teacher. I received your letter dated August 4th on the third day before the Ides of August (August 11th) in the evening, and the next morning I received a letter from the ecclesiastical lord of Strasbourg, Johannes Gerner, minister of the French church, in which he indicated that by the order of the illustrious patrician Jakob Sturm, by decree of the senate, I was called and offered 150 Strasbourg florins or up to 200 annually, to teach law in the school and to provide counsel to the republic whenever requested. On the same day, I received new letters from Augsburg. Following your most serious and loving advice, and that of the most faithful pastor and friends, who agreed with you, I decided to accept the conditions in Strasbourg, even content with a smaller portion.</p>
      <p>The messenger, who promised to return on the eleventh day, returned on the twenty-second day, namely September 2nd, bringing confirmation and urging me to hasten. I have always had the greatest desire for the most Christian duke, who was the first to be concerned about me; but by approaching closer, I will be able to serve him no less; then I will more easily go for the French church; I will be able to bring my family next summer (although this year they will not come in any way, as a certain friend from Lorraine, who had taken on that province, was seized by a long fever), yet I have not abandoned that hope. Then I will also have a French printing press, not just a Latin one, and I hope soon to gratify you more, with the happy outcome and success of your paternal advice. At the end of this week, with the books packed, I will set out with God as my guide. Moreover, I never thought that anonymous book was by the most learned lord Bibliander, and soon, as I saw one page, I was certain that the rumor (which soon cooled) was false. But what I thought was of interest to you and him, I noted. A book was finally published against me in Paris and sent to me from Lyon, but it is so inept and poorly founded, having nothing solid, that I do not deem it worthy of a response, since apart from the Latin (which is quite strong), it does not differ from the pamphlets of unlearned monks, who have more harmed than helped the cause of their pope. The French edition, much more extensive, suffices, which I will still delay, so that the family may have some respite. I owe you more for the many services with which you have overwhelmed me with more than paternal affection, and your advice, which I cannot explain with many letters or words. If I can ever do anything for you and yours, know that I am most ready and obedient. May the Lord Jesus keep you and prosper you for His glory and the edification of His church, until you enter into the joy of your Lord. I also wish to greet in my name the venerable father lord Pellican, lord Bibliander, your sons-in-law, and friends. Lord Guillaume Farel, the most faithful pastor, by whose ministry I again received the holy supper of the Lord today, diligently performs his duty and greets you and your entire church. Farewell happily. Neuchâtel, September 3, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted and obedient Charles du Moulin, formerly of Paris, now designated as a legal consultant of Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>I do not yet have scribes. Two were sent from Paris, one with a horse given by my wife, whom I rejected, because he wanted to idle rather than study at my expense, the other... is still in Geneva... will be. But while I am, God willing, in the act of profession, I hope suitable ones will not be lacking, as many as I will need. I commend my work and the benefit given by the Lord to your prayers and those of your church, so that I may no longer be... from the fruit of works. It is the month in which they published my death in Dijon, I think because nothing was seen from there as I was accustomed; but soon the adversaries will feel that God still uses me, or rather His work in me. To Him alone be the glory.</p>
      <p>By your order, I wrote to the most illustrious Count Georg, and after waiting 15 days, if anyone... Montbéliard, as by the care of lord Toussaint... with no one coming out due to the plague, I sent to Geneva to Joachim Soler, the German. Being in Basel, I resigned these, to add that I came with the packages of books enclosed in a single large chest by ship to Solothurn on September 12th, where the next day I was invited to dinner by Albespine, the abbot of Bassefontaine, the royal legate, to inquire from me what is the state and purpose of my affairs, promising many things verbosely, as he is cunning and most devoted to the mind of his Henry and the impious constable, and therefore less candid and less favorable to religion than his predecessor Morelet. Great barbarism... avarice and harshness in Solothurn. In two days I did not find anyone who could point out a suitable carriage, even if they were leaving for Basel in the meantime; finally, I was forced on the third day to offer 4 solidos to a certain idle person at home and 9 batz for the toll, so that a carriage would carry a single chest to Basel. I was offering double the usual rate for the weight to merchants, but they refused. Still, since I promised to be present on Friday evening at my old lodging near Floris, it did not arrive until Saturday evening, nor will I be separated from the chest, in which are my writings, I will board the next departing ship with them. Lord Bonifacius Amerbach, the most learned and obliging, and Doctor of Theology Wolfgang (to whom I left these to be sent to you) each wanted to receive me at their home, but I stayed at the inn next to the Rhine, so that I might more quickly board the first boat. You know the English church is under heavier oppression, certainly under the papal Mary, than Germany recently was; but so that those who are of God may be made manifest and in the meantime the church may be separated from strangers and impostors (even under the cross), this is the fire of the Lord, by which it is tested. But the Lord will come freely, nor will there be lacking the power of arms for the demolition of fortifications and councils, all exalting themselves against the knowledge of God. Pray for them and for us. Again, farewell happily. Basel, September 17, 1553.</p>
      <p>September 18. Lord Hieronymus Sanctus, an Italian, is marrying the daughter of Lord Coelius Secundus Curio, an Italian, former professor of Basel, in rhetoric. That Sanctus is called by the same Strasbourg republic to a theological profession with an honorable stipend and house given. On September 6th, I enclosed all the books and a few packages in a single large chest; on September 11th, the messenger... on September 19th, I will board the boat, so that the next day I will enter Strasbourg with the books. Lord Bonifacius Amerbach took care of these for me as a brother.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful and vigilant pastor of the Zürich church.</p>
      <p>Zürich. Switzerland.</p>
