      <p>Greetings. I remember you writing to me, my dear Bullinger, about a certain blasphemous attacker or rather slanderer of the most holy Trinity, and you commended vigilance on that account. And indeed, the matter is worthy of faithful attention. But I do not see how I might proceed with the investigation of the author, since I neither know anyone nor have I heard of anyone who would even whisper such a crime.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you would do a most welcome service if you could provide us with some indication of the circumstances (if you can do nothing else), from which there might be an opportunity to detect and prevent this pernicious and deadly poison. I have already tried many ways, and those in secret, both among the learned, who are accustomed to study, and among the printers, to see if even a spark of this madness might be found lurking somewhere. But all in vain, so that I either think it is a rumor spread through malicious suspicion, or that the attempt is suppressed by fear. Meanwhile, continue to keep watch with us, as you do, and farewell.</p>
      <p>Basel, 19th of May, in the year 1556.</p>
      <p>Simon Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
