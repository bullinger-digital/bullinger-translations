      <p>Greetings. You have understood from Beza, to whom I wrote these days, that I could achieve nothing with our magistrate. Meanwhile, I understand that the German princes agreed with King Ferdinand before the year that they would recognize us as excluded and not support us.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it would be in vain to proceed with them unless someone simply accepted the Augsburg Confession. This, which was attempted in various ways and much by Bucer years ago, could never be obtained from our people. Here, the edict of the princes of Stettin will be presented, from which you will understand that what I have just mentioned and is written to me by faithful friends is not entirely in vain. The Papists, with their cunning and diabolical art, are joining them to themselves to separate them from us.</p>
      <p>But it will be enough for us to be united with Christ and to agree with those to whom the Lord has given one and the same mind.</p>
      <p>We must be careful not to be torn apart. For the temptations of Satan are various and grave.</p>
      <p>I commend to you this good man, John Limus Scotus. He can tell you much about our Philip, who, if he were stronger and freely expressed what he feels, would have things better with many. Although it is quite certain that our adversaries will not be moved. For they are driven by insane fury. Farewell, most esteemed lord and dearest brother. Greet all the fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Budaeus, Mr. Ionville, Mr. Badius, Mr. Laurentius Normand and others known to us. From Italy, we hear that serious negotiations are taking place between the Pope and the kings about peace, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 19, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
