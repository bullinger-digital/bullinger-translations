    <p xml:id="regest1">If Luther is dead, then may he have died happily. Not everything about him is to be rejected. However, according to his own demand, he could indeed be completely rejected, for he said in his [„Short Confession“] against the people of Zurich that anyone who errs in a single article cannot be right in any other; and it is clear that he himself went astray in some points, such as in the matter of images, auricular confession, and the Lord's Supper. In other respects, however, Bullinger agrees with Luther. If he should have left behind a writing against the people of Zurich, only its content will be refuted, avoiding any personal attacks; for nothing bad should be said about the dead! Haller should also speak moderately and honorably about the deceased. If the conversation turns to the Lord's Supper, images, and confession, he should say that even significant men in the church sometimes erred, and that Luther should not be regarded as a god.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- If Luther is not dead, then may he live as long as it seems good to the Lord.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Since Bullinger possesses the [Old] and the [New Testament], he would never buy [the records] of the [Second] Regensburg [Religious] Discussion and the Council of Trent. The [discussion] consists of both right and wrong and therefore does not allow for hope of a complete reformation. The [Council], however, is to be rejected as a work of the [papal] Antichrist; and the fickle [Bucer] will eventually strike the hard [Christ] rock.</p>

      <p>S.P. If Luther is dead, then I wish him to have died happily. For there are many things in him that the best people rightly admire and praise, and it would indeed be malicious to condemn him entirely. According to his own opinion, he could be rejected entirely: For in his last writing published against us, he says that anyone who errs in one article cannot think rightly in any, yet it is clear that he erred in some. Therefore, I would not condemn in him what he says well, prudently, and piously. Thus, as I never agreed with him on the matter of images, auricular confession, and the Lord's Supper, so in other well-said and done matters, I have never denied my support. If he left behind a writing against us, we will respond to the arguments, disregarding the person. For it is disgraceful to speak ill of the dead and to wrestle with ghosts, as it is said. I write this more extensively so that you too may speak modestly, indeed honorably, of the deceased. When it comes to the matter of the Lord's Supper, images, and confession, you will say that great men in the church once also had their errors; thus, Luther too, by divine providence, stumbled in these matters, so that he would not be regarded as a god, etc.</p>

      <p>If indeed he is not dead, may he live (as far as we are concerned) as long as it seems good to the Lord of life and death! However, I would like you to inform me with the first news, what the truth is, especially by what kind of death he was extinguished and how he passed away.</p>

      <p>As for me, since I have the conversations of God with Moses and of Christ, the Son of God, with his disciples, as well as the counsels of the patriarchs and prophets, and finally the writings of the apostles, I would not buy the Regensburg Colloquy and the Council of Trent for an empty nut. For the former, because it is composed entirely (and would that it were entirely, not from the corrupted) and corrupt, gives me no hope of sincere reformation. But the latter (since it is instituted by the Antichrist and for no other purpose than to restore Satan and expel Christ) who does not see that it is not only of no authority but also to be spat upon, as it fears blasphemy?</p>
      <p>That fickle Vertumnus will eventually strike the solid rock. Farewell with yours, etc.</p>
