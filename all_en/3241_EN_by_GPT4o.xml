      <p>Greetings. For a long time, I have written nothing to you, brother in the Lord, worthy of honor, for no other reason than that I had nothing worthy to write to you, as I still do not. However, so that you do not suspect otherwise, I am sending these brief lines, to which I have attached our writings on the matter of the marriage of that man from Wil, sent under the condition that, if it seemed appropriate, I would retain them. Since our court does not permit marriage in the 2nd and 3rd degree nor blesses foreign marriages, it seemed more prudent to retain yours than to give them myself, not to mention that these foreigners often present the matter differently than it actually is, so that it is not without risk to deal with such matters in writing.</p>
      <p>Several princes had gathered in Frankfurt; it is said that this assembly has been dissolved. The dispute between Hesse and Nassau is said to be settled.</p>
      <p>The princes are urging the Worms colloquium, agreed upon for August 24th; for it seems that King Ferdinand is cooling off, as it is reported that the Emperor of the Turks has died and his two sons are waging war over the succession. Philip is preparing a huge army against the French. The Queen of England has declared war against the French, despite some English nobles opposing it; but she persists. The Livonian and Prussian wars have also flared up again. What is happening in Italy and Naples, we expect to hear from you. We are all well here (by the grace of God).</p>
      <p>Greet Lord Matthaeus Cognetius, with whom you will have these matters in common. I wrote, and those letters were intercepted, as he knows; therefore, I write nothing, so as not to inconvenience him. Please tell him this, I pray. Greet Lord Gallicius, Lord Tscharner, and Lord Ambrosius, Lord Pontasella, and our other friends and brothers. Various and doubtful reports are coming from Italy and Piedmont to Zurich; I expect certain news from you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, July 16, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent men, Lord Johannes Fabricius, preacher of the Gospel at St. Martin in Chur, esteemed lord, godfather, and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Hansen Schmid, preacher at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
