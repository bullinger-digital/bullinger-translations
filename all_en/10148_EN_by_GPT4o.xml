    <p xml:id="regest1">Megander can now personally report on the Bernese church in Zurich. Haller hopes for Bullinger's visit to Bern; he returns Bullinger's letter No. 110 addressed to Bucer and requests further information, asks for advice on how the authorities should deal with the Anabaptists, praises Bullinger's and Pellican's Bible commentaries, and requests information about Johannes Ramsauer.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You have our Megander, dearest Heinrich, as a living letter of all those things you wish to know about the affairs of our church. Enjoy this, and satisfy yourself with his conversation. And if only I could have the happiness, even once, to speak with you alone or with Pellican, Leo, and the others into the long nights! I am always compelled, whether I like it or not, to hide away in my corner and to do with letters among brothers what I would rather and could do in person. You are the only one among all who is neither ashamed nor regretful to accommodate all my needs, and that, which I consider by far the greatest, with a sincere and full heart of love. May the Lord, as long as He wishes to deem me worthy of His ministry, either grant me you entirely or keep you safe in Zurich for many years, not only for our churches and brothers but for the whole Christian republic! Do what you have promised to do. I am waiting for the feast of Bartholomew, during which, if you do not visit us, you will finally experience that I have truly written that you will never see me in Bern.</p>
      <p>I am returning your letter written to Bucer along with the advice we also gave. Everything is pleasing, and if only they have fair judges. Let me know how things are now with Bucer. I wish I had a copy of that letter, or from whom you were persuaded to announce such things through Sebastian Zofingen. The integrity of the brothers in Strasbourg is otherwise certain, unless they have now become different.</p>
      <p>Who would dislike the commentaries on the Hebrews, except those who like nothing? Continue. Nothing delays me, because Megander, skilled in languages, sees no commentaries. I am delighted with Pellican's and your works, which I say without flattery. I see the absence of ostentation, of dispute, but the presence of sincerity, and that the true meaning of the scriptures is rendered to us, as long as you both continue.</p>
      <p>From the acts of the Anabaptists, you will learn what was done in Zofingen. I would need your advice on what means should be used by the magistrate to combat this sect. I fear that they may thirst too much for their blood, and I also fear that too much indulgence will greatly inconvenience the churches. Therefore, wherever you can, inform me through a letter via Megander. Hence, ensure that what has been added to the Hebrews and Pellican's commentaries is sent in a bundle through Megander's servant.</p>
      <p>I long to see and hear you in person, even once. I will be the traveler, you be the traveler, dearest and most beloved Heinrich, and there is no need to communicate your arrival to many, as long as I could be certain of it.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and may it be perpetual with your wife, family, brothers, and fellow students, and let me know how your brother has been with you, even with a single word.</p>
      <p>5th of August.</p>
      <p>Your smallest but most devoted coin.</p>
      <p>There is one among us, who was supposed to be a pastor in Boswil in the Emmental, who is heard badly. If he is known to you, tell me what testimony he has. Otherwise, I write my letters, the most reliable witnesses of my mind towards you, to you alone. Always and forever, farewell and be well.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the Zurich churchman, his dearest brother.</p>
