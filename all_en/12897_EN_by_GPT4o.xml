    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Here are some news from letters or stories from others.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The imperial troops that Ruff von Reischach recruited before Shrove Tuesday in [Southern Germany] were decimated at the muster place near Bremen by the Hanseatic cities. If only the [Schmalkaldic League had fought as bravely], the situation would not be so dire now! The Hanseatic cities and Denmark are setting out for war; where to, is unknown.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] As the successor of the deceased Polish King [Sigismund I], his son [Sigismund II] was crowned in Krakow. A messenger from Wrocław [...] reported that at the coronation, the envoy [...] of the Turkish Sultan Suleiman was present, that Suleiman had promised his daughter to the young king, and the wedding would take place after Easter [April 10, 1547].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] At the request of King Ferdinand I, the authorities of Wrocław granted him a tax of one groschen per sack of grain for the fight against Suleiman. However, after just 15 weeks, this agreement was revoked. The people of Wrocław want to use the money themselves to arm against the Turks.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Ferdinand also wanted Wrocław to supply Emperor Charles V with artillery and ammunition. Many city lords agreed. But when the decision was to be implemented, such resistance arose at a public assembly that they had to refuse Ferdinand, citing the threatening armaments of Suleiman.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] A few days ago, a messenger [...] came from Ulm. He reported terrible things about the devastation of the city by the Emperor, who also confiscated ten cannons with ammunition and a lot of money. Due to the stormy rainy weather, he is still in Nördlingen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] A stranger [...] is recruiting servants with 100 cavalrymen at Ensisheim (it is not known for what purpose). To his annoyance, however, only a few offer themselves.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Landgrave Philip of Hesse is allegedly arming.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Envoys [Jakob Sturm, Marx Hag, Friedrich von Gottesheim, and Ludwig Gremp] were sent from Strasbourg to conclude the peace treaty with the Emperor. The people of Strasbourg are probably not quite in their right mind, for like the other cities, they are praying to a decaying idol! They will soon realize that this one harbors a hatred against German freedom as deep as that of Publius Vatinius.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony is said to be back in possession of his land, including Leipzig, and to have inflicted two defeats on Duke Maurice of Saxony.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Based on a letter that reached Basel via Prague and Augsburg, it is considered certain that there is an uprising in Bohemia against King Ferdinand, as the Bohemians, due to their alliance with the Elector, do not want to march against the latter, although Ferdinand demands it emphatically. Therefore, the Emperor is rushing to the King to prevent his expulsion.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] In the coming summer, there will be great unrest, and God's kingdom will spread against all expectations. Greetings. The rest is written by Myconius. What is new in Zurich?</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Here are some news that have been written and told to me by others, in brief:</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The soldiers recruited by Ruff von Reischach before Shrove Tuesday in these lands for the Emperor were defeated along with other soldiers at the muster place not far from Bremen by the Hanseatic cities. Few of them escaped. If our own had done the same, the situation would be better! The Hanseatic cities and Denmark are setting out for war; where to, no one can know.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The King of Poland has died; the son of the King was crowned in Krakow as the King of Poland. At the coronation, the envoy of the Turkish Sultan was present with 400 horses, splendidly dressed, and the word is (I heard this orally from a messenger from Wrocław these days) that the Sultan has betrothed his daughter to the young king, and they plan to have the wedding after Easter in Krakow.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The same messenger said: The people of Wrocław were persuaded by the request of King Ferdinand to impose a tax of one groschen per sack of grain to give him this tax, so that he might better prepare himself to fight against the Turks. Something intervened, and they have given him the money for only 15 weeks. Then they announced this to him. They want to keep it themselves to fight against the Turks.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Likewise, Ferdinand requested from the city of Wrocław to send artillery and gunpowder to the Emperor, which some of the great lords agreed to. But when it was to be carried out, there was such murmuring among the people that they had to refuse him, citing the great armament of the Turks.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>A messenger from Ulm arrived in Basel these days. He reported terrible things, how Ulm was devastated, how the Emperor robbed them, taking 10 pieces of artillery with all the equipment, and much money away. He is stuck in Nördlingen due to the stormy rains and cannot move further.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>There is an Italian lord with 100 horses at Ensisheim. He is recruiting servants. However, he finds little military force, which makes him dissatisfied. Where he intends to use them is not said.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The Landgrave is said to be arming.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>The people of Strasbourg rode after the Emperor. They desire a treaty. They are mad along with the other cities and worship the decaying idol of the Emperor! They will eventually realize what they have done with the enemy, who pursues German freedom with a hatred like that of Publius Vatinius.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>The Elector of Saxony is said to have regained his land, including Leipzig. It is also said that Duke Maurice was defeated twice.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>In Bohemia, there is a great discord against the king, and this is certain. For it is written from Prague to Augsburg; from Augsburg to us. For they do not want to inconvenience Saxony because of the alliance; but Ferdinand insists and urges. Therefore, the Emperor is hurrying, lest King Ferdinand be expelled from Bohemia.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>We see that this summer there will be great turmoil and the kingdom of God will be propagated against all expectations! Farewell. Basel, March 17, 1547. The rest is by Myconius. Write back, what is new with you. Yours, Gastius.</p>
      <p>To the honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my dear, kind lord and friend. Zurich.</p>
