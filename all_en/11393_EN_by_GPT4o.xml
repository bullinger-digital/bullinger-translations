    <p xml:id="regest1">Your position [No. 1338] aligns with his own stance in the dispute [regarding his doctoral promotion]; despite possible accusations, he would rather leave Basel and Germany than submit to this papist custom, and in this regard, he no longer needs advice. However, he has already asked Bullinger and now wants to know from all of you whether the awarding of the title through the laying on of hands - in the sense of a church appointment - would seem acceptable if a compromise should become unavoidable. He cannot adequately reciprocate your care, but he would like to maintain it.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have read your opinion on our dispute, which is clearly written in accordance with my own view. Although there are many things that greatly concern me, such as having stirred up a serious commotion over a trivial matter, having avoided a matter placed in the middle and not unmanageable even for good people, or having either not wanted or not been able to address it, having arrogantly placed my own opinion and will above the authority and requests of so many people, and finally, being called and seen as a proud and factious man, and many other things that are often thrown at me by many, these, I say, although they sometimes trouble me, being of such a nature and disposition that I strive (as he says) to please as many as possible and to offend as few as possible, yet this very thing has long been fixed and settled with me, to leave not only Basel but all of Germany rather than introduce this papal mask. And I want to call upon the Lord as a witness here with you and all good people, that nothing drives me to this decision except that I consider this kind of pomp unworthy of the church's customs and in no way useful or necessary for literature, about which I will write shortly, God willing. And indeed, this has been my opinion since the very beginning of the gospel; therefore, I will no longer trouble you or anyone else here by seeking advice.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, regarding what I recently reported privately to Bullinger, but through him to you, I wish and want to use your authority and consensus, which I must always respect, in a similar manner, not as if I have now fully decided to do this, but if some greater force of prayers or exhortations should press upon me from somewhere, so that I can do what I am willing to grant to the church with your approval. For since this laying on of hands in the ecclesiastical assembly, not scholastic, done by the authority of the church, not the school, calling to the office of the church, not the theater and circle of the school, cannot be honestly refused, I have taken the decision, if the matter done by me can appease the clamor of the adversaries, remove the offense of the senate, and satisfy the exhortations of neighboring churches and good people, to do it, since we must also concede something here to these human pursuits, although I have certainly often and much strengthened my mind at this time not to admit this title, to which we have been led to be received into the church solely by contention. However, I think it is not so much to be considered what they do, as what is fitting for us. Therefore, I await your advice on this matter in the Lord, dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>Indeed, when I see and consider with myself how much my affairs are of concern to you, and with what efforts you support that grace of the Lord which you embrace in me, to which not only your private houses are open here, but also the patronage of the most distinguished senate is offered through the same, I find nothing in myself at all by which I can respond to your faithfulness towards me. However, I see that I must strive greatly to preserve this perpetual goodwill of yours and your republic towards me.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>S. Grynäus, your brother in the Lord Christ.</p>
      <p>To the ministers of the word of God in Zürich, most distinguished men, esteemed brothers.</p>
