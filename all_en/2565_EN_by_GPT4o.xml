      <p>S. D. D. Johannes Willingus, called from the Rhaetians, preaches in the Pr√§ttigau valley.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant a noble spirit to the lord of Rappoltsweiler, so that he may desire and dare the things of Christ! I am sending to your piety two booklets, one in Latin by Mr. Calvin against our antagonists in the matter of the Lord's Supper, the other in German about the Last Judgment; I have also added another copy for the most illustrious prince. If you think it would not be unwelcome to him, I ask you to offer it to him in my name and to embellish it with your words and to convey my most dutiful greetings. I have not written anything myself, so as not to be a burden to him. However, if you think he will have no regard for either me or the booklet, I leave it to you to give it to whomever you wish.</p>
      <p>There are various new things among us, which, since it is not safe to commit them to paper, both because they are spread by uncertain authors and because some are quite odious, we will entrust to time. There is also much talk about peace being established between the Emperor and the French, about continuing the council, that is, about eradicating the truth. May the Lord preserve His church! I would write more, but being hindered by business and excluded by the brevity of time, I am drawn elsewhere. Pray to the Lord for us. Greet the brothers and friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all good things. Zurich, February 24, in the year of our Lord 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Matthias Erb, most faithful pastor of the church in Riquewihr, his esteemed lord and very dear brother.</p>
      <p>To H. Matthias Erb, preacher in Riquewihr.</p>
