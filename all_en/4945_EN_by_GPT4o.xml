      <p>S. I have inquired about all things, et quae scribo, sunt certa (and what I write is certain).</p>
      <p>The day is extended until Sunday before Gallus, id est (that is) the 12th of October, invitis legatis (against the will of the envoys), and once set in Davos. However, I hope, those speaking from the Upper League, they have since found in the protocol that it belongs to them. Quicquid est (Whatever it is), it is extended.</p>
      <p>Now, write to Mr. Coignet about all this, so that it proceeds more formally and the king's message may come itself. Adhuc unum (One more thing): The pope's and Philipp's envoys have become so bitterly at odds with each other that they parted from each other last night from the chamber. Hęc certa (These things are certain). 3rd of September.</p>
      <p>T[uus] Fab[ricius].</p>
      <p>To the truly great and especially pious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his master.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Bullinger. Zürich.</p>
