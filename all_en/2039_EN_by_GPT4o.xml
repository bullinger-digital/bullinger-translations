      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord Father through Christ Jesus. I would indeed wish, as much as possible, not to abuse your kindness, most humane Bullinger, and especially because I see that your studies and labors are of such great value that they should not be disturbed by anyone. However, when either the church or private necessity compels me to the point that I cannot turn elsewhere, I do not doubt that you will show yourself to be the same as you have been towards everyone so far, namely most humane and benevolent.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the reason I am addressing you by letter is both a public and private matter, in which you alone can provide us with uncommon benefit: public, because our republic needs a sub-teacher or supervisor; for another has been appointed in place of the deceased parish priest in Paradies.</p>
      <p>If therefore there is anyone among you who is honest, learned, diligent, and whose services you no longer need, I ask you to recommend him to our schoolmaster, the bearer of this letter. He will enumerate all the conditions to him. You will indeed do a favor both to our republic and to us. The private matter, which I partly share with my other brothers and fellow ministers, partly concerns the danger to my own head. You know that Finsler was dismissed by our senate; he now transfers all blame to us, and as far as we understand, he maligns us among the brothers with his slanders, and that unjustly, I swear by God; for his own greed, with which he acted more than usuriously towards anyone, has cast him out. You learned some of his frauds earlier through our Jacob. And since it seemed good to him to tarnish our reputation among good brothers, although we intended not to involve ourselves further in his affairs, yet, because he can easily gain trust among those who do not know the man as well as we do, it seemed good to my brothers and me to plead our case of innocence with you. Therefore, the whole matter stands thus: at the hour when our magistrate dismissed him without our knowledge and when we least expected it, he approached me and wanted us, along with our entire synod, to intercede for him with the senate. There I immediately told the man that if it had been in our hands, we would have dismissed him long ago, nor could I understand that there was anyone in our entire congregation who would have agreed to his pleas. He then tried with amazing tricks to intrude again, but all in vain, and he achieved nothing else from it than that his many frauds were exposed, which otherwise would have remained dormant. For, to pass over other things, is this not an intolerable usury that he exercised against a certain poor parishioner two years ago? When he, along with his family, was oppressed by hunger and debt, he approached Finsler, begging him to lend him some silver. Finsler first denied having anything; finally, when the other insisted, he drove the man (for he was pressed by more than adamantine necessity) to enter into these agreements: he counted out six thalers and some small change to him, then he had debtors scattered here and there, whose debts he had to collect, the total of which, along with the counted silver, amounted to forty florins; he had to give an annual interest of two florins, nor could the other, although he labored and spent much, gather all the money, the annual interest of which he has already paid for two years. Four florins also remain to be collected, which he has long despaired of recovering; nevertheless, as if he had received them for his own use, he is forced to pay the interest. He has sureties, so that at any hour he demands the principal with interest, they are compelled to pay. Is this not an intolerable usury, especially in a minister of the word? But enough about this. Through tears, widowhood, and the abundance of children, he was able to obtain from the most honorable senate letters of testimony, better than he deserved, and his case was turned into a civil penalty, to which we did not object.</p>
      <p>The other matter, which distresses us and concerns the danger to my head, was stirred up by Johannes Winz√ºrn, formerly a parish priest in Wangen; you yourself know what kind of person he is; he maligns us all so miserably (as we hear) that if he spoke the truth, we would regret ourselves. He involves everyone in a common crime: he says he was expelled by us both from the ministry and from the land of our town, because we could not tolerate anyone more learned, fearing that he might take the lead in the judgment of our church. Among those to whom he does not speak words, but gives them, he perhaps has some agreement; those who know the man easily smell the purest sycophancy; for it was not us, but his unclean, intolerable whoring, and also various adulteries that vomited him out. Often admonished by us, the synod, and the consistory to repent, he refused, but rather sought to add iniquity to iniquity, until he added perjury to adultery with great scandal to the church and common infamy of the ministers. Let him now go and try to make us infamous, the most infamous man. Nor did it seem enough to him to add crime to crime unless he involved me in his slanders so that neither space nor place is given for extricating myself. He knows this art well, the most terrible sycophant attacks the innocent from plausible things, so that he may thereby gain trust for his lies, even to the extreme misery of the innocent. How fortunate, by the immortal God, he has found a matter for slander: some years ago you know that a not small slander was constructed against me among certain members of the senatorial order in Zurich concerning our bridge; which, because it seemed plausible, was easily believed by some. I had cleared myself, if I am not mistaken, towards your humanity, so that I believed myself cleared in general. Now through this rascal, the slander grows worse; he says I inveighed against your most honorable senate in a sermon; the impudent monk lies to his own head (honor to your ears); our senate will testify for us, our whole church will testify. I have spoken more about this matter to Mr. Johannes Wolf than ever before. I would have wished and still wish that this dispute be decided either by law or benevolence, so that no handle is given to our malevolence towards yours; for it was not a small cause of the miserable federation with the King of France, when there were those who shouted that they had a powerful neighbor, that they ought to conform to the other Swiss, lest they be left without all help and favor and perhaps finally perish through foreigners. But that I have spoken anything of which I might still repent or that I would not dare to speak and freely confess before your most honorable senate, God forbid. For I am a Zurich native from my mother, I still have many relatives and kin both in Zurich and in the Zurich countryside, and I can never wish ill to the Zurichers, among whom the gospel was reborn and also communicated to us. Therefore, most humane Bullinger, if you ever notice that traps have been laid by this impure man, I ask you to excuse me in such a way that a place remains for me to clear myself before your most honorable senate. Although, if the perjured man were given his due, an honest man might be preferred before him. Now we seek no other patronage than what is joined with honesty, truth, and justice. And I beg you to consider this verbosity with fairness and goodness.</p>
      <p>Our fellow ministers greet you. Also, in our name, greet Mr. Pellican, Theodor, our Gwalther, and Frisius. Meanwhile, farewell, long safe for the church of Christ.</p>
      <p>In Schaffhausen, in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
