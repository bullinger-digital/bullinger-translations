      <p>Greetings and Peace. The reason I write so rarely to your piety is the lack of news worthy of you, and I do not wish to trouble you with trifles. However, the few things we have from Italy, I have explained to Master Fabricius, so that he may communicate the same to your piety, and I have asked him to add my greetings, which I also add here along with the perpetual offering of my services to your piety. Given at Chur, Rhaetia, on the 22nd of November, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your piety's most obedient friend, J. Ja. Decambray.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Church of Zürich, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
