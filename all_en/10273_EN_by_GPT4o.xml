    <p xml:id="regest1">A teaching position is to be filled in Kempten. Benedikt Euander was therefore contacted in writing and has introduced himself, but he does not want to commit to anything without the consent of the people of Zurich. Please release him from the position in Zurich, as he is needed in Kempten.</p>

      <p>We pray for you to have an increase in the knowledge of God.</p>
      <p>Since the Lord, in His kindness, most honorable men, has so enlightened our magistrate that He wishes to support His flock not only with prophets showing the way of the Lord, but also with a guide for the youth, instilling what they call tenacity of mind, He has entrusted us, the ministers of the word, to inquire about a certain learned and pious man who would be beneficial to our youth in every way, who could adorn this blooming age not only with doctrine but also with morals. Immediately, Benedict Euander came to mind, who, having been summoned by us through letters, was compelled by certain other reasons to visit his native land and was gracious enough to come to see what we were doing. When he was present, the position of the literary school was offered to him, which he indeed did not wish to undertake under any agreement until he felt that you had consented and he had relinquished the prior position he holds with you. Therefore, the matter lies buried in your hands. We earnestly beseech you, our lords and teachers, that you place no obstacle and do not in any way disrupt our business. For we have great need of this man. Act, so that we may feel the traces of your charity, which seeks not itself, but the neighbor. When you do this, as we hope you will, we will strive to repay you in any way possible. The rest, which should not be entrusted to the pen, you will learn from the bearer of the letters.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Done at Kempten, July 14, 1533.</p>
      <p>Jakob Haistung, Vitus Kappeller, Paulus Rodocomus.</p>
      <p>To the men of pure piety, Heinrich Bullinger, Leo Jud, Konrad Pellikan, ministers of the word of the Lord in Zurich, their most esteemed brothers.</p>
