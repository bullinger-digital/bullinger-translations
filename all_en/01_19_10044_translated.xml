  <input>Gratiam ac pacem a deo per Christum.

Diligentiam tuam in veterum scriptis vehementer laudo, optime frater (sic adpellari volo, nam quod me praeceptorem tuum vocas, minime agnosco), fortia enim sunt contra papistas iacula, nimirum quibus ipsi ut columnis nituntur. Sed non video, quid contra insensatos illos ac plane stipites satis forte sit, qui ita omnem humanitatis sensum exuerunt, ita toti ad omnem veritatem obriguerunt, ut non beluas eos ac feras, sed truncos potius dicere possis. Quedam ferro, quedam sanguine molliuntur, ut de adamante ferunt, neque beneficiis ducuntur neque poenis tenentur.

Iam quoniam te video totum huc spectare, ut gloria Christi quam latissime propagetur, rogo te, ut, si quid ex lectione Erasmica aut Lutherana collegeris atque memorie (qua plurimum vales) mandaveris, quod ad eucharistiam adtinet, ocyssime ad me mittas. Nam illorum de eucharistia sententiam hoc libellulo, quem ad te mitto, christianis proposui, ut omnes videant quid ambo de hac re olim apud se senserint, ac si sapere velint, nobis accedant. Volo enim quae hic breviter congessi et quasi gustanda praebui, diligentius ac fusius tractare, idque latine, ut sic vel hypocritis tandem persona detrahatur aut certe infirmitas sanetur.

Vale, charissime Henrice.

Leo Jud tuus.

Que tibi scripsi, lapidi dixerim.

  <output>I wish you grace and peace from God through Christ. I highly praise your diligence in the works of the ancients, my dearest brother (for this I wish to be called, as I do not acknowledge what you call me as your teacher), for they are strong weapons against the papists, in which they rely as if on pillars. But I do not see what could be sufficiently strong against those senseless and completely wooden people who have so completely lost all sense of humanity and have become so hardened to all truth that you could not call them beasts or animals, but rather trunks. Some are softened by iron, some by blood, as they say of adamant, and they are not led by benefits or held by punishments.

Now since I see that you are completely devoted to spreading the glory of Christ as far as possible, I ask you, if you have gathered anything from Erasmus's or Luther's readings and remembered (in which you are very much skilled), to send it to me quickly regarding the Eucharist. For I have proposed to Christians this little book, which I am sending to you, so that they may all see what the two of them once thought about this matter, and if they want to be wise, they may come to us. For I want to treat more diligently and more extensively what I have briefly gathered here and provided as if it were a taste, and to do so in Latin, so that either the person of the hypocrites may be removed or at least their weakness may be healed.

Farewell, dearest Henry.

Your Leo Jud.

What I wrote to you, I should say to a stone.

To Heimrich, his brother.</output>
