      <p>I WANTED to consult for a few days the health of my wife and our little daughter, who, though somewhat worn out from the journey, have now moderately recovered from their rest. You will receive with these a piece of cloth for trousers better than the one you previously bought from me, yet at the same or even a lower price. It contains, I estimate, at least 20 Zürich ells: if it contains more or fewer, you will inform me of this in your next letters, which I ask you to send to Richard Hilles, our old friend; then I hope in good faith they will be returned to me. This cloth should be divided between Mr. Consul and you: I would have sent a second one if I had found it for sale here.</p>
      <p>As soon as I arrive in London, I will send, God willing, one not worse nor at a higher price. Everyone here who transports cloth from England sells it for profit, and I found this cloth with difficulty. They have many thousands, but they only sell to those who buy 10 or 20 whole pieces at once, so as not to confuse the order of the cloths, so that the better, the mediocre, and the worse may mutually assist each other in price and sale. Or if you keep this cloth for yourself, or Mr. Consul keeps it for himself; I will send a second to the one of you who lacks it.</p>
      <p>I bought this for 40 shillings in white, that is, six ducats; a ducat makes 40 Brabant stuivers; 40 Brabant stuivers make 24 Constance bations; for the dyeing of the cloth, I gave 8 Brabant shillings, which constitute 28 Constance bations and a little more: for the transport to Strasbourg, I do not yet know what I will give; but having calculated the cost of all expenses, you will have a Zürich ell for 10 Zürich batz; if there are 20 ells, they make two hundred batz, two hundred batz make 8 French solar crowns, which is the price of the whole cloth. When I come to London, perhaps I will send to you at a lower price; in the meantime, consider my effort fair and good, which I owe to you as a most revered father and lord, and will owe as long as I live. I wish that this cloth be divided between Mr. Consul and you, so that when I send the second, you may be equal in the quality and price of the cloth. And if hereafter for clothes or trousers it pleases you to use English cloth (say the same in my name to Mr. and our brother Gualter), I will always most willingly offer my services to you. And see that you love me, so that those who write at my expense may most diligently receive the memorials of your sermons; if they do not spare their labors, I in turn will not spare money. Keep the money for this cloth with you until I inform you by letters for what use I will employ it. My wife and all who are with me greet your charity, your wife, and your whole family, and in our name, you will pray for the health of Mr. Gualter, Mr. Pellican, indeed the Israelites, and all other learned and most loving brothers.</p>
      <p>You will not be burdened further to greet most reverently and honorably in my name Mr. Consul, to whom I wish all prosperity and to the Zürich republic with the highest wishes. May the Lord keep you safe, pious, and unharmed by His Spirit for a long time, and may you defend the fold of Christ from wolves and hirelings until the coming of the glory of God!</p>
      <p>Antwerp, May 3, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours always in mind and body, JOHN HOOPER: You will take care of the other letters which I send to you, to whom they are destined, I ask. After Easter, my wife wrote to her mother, who lives 15 miles from Antwerp. The messenger found the father dead; the mother received the letters and gave them to my wife's brother to read, who immediately threw them unread into the fire. You see the words of Christ are true: Brother will persecute sister for the word of God.</p>
      <p>To the servant of Christ Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most pious overseer of the Zürich church, and his most revered lord.</p>
