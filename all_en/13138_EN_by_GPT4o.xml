    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The very friendly and educated [...] Hospinian delivered Bullinger's letter [not received]. Unfortunately, he arrived at a very inconvenient time. Blarer was suffering from stomach pains and diarrhea. Another [...] even had to take over his sermon. Moreover, Hospinian stayed only very briefly: During their fleeting conversation, Blarer learned that he and his companions would leave Konstanz already after lunch. To his great regret, Blarer could not receive Hospinian in a manner befitting Bullinger's recommendation and Hospinian's dignity. Bullinger should not hold this against him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] There is nothing new to report about Konstanz's situation. As a result of the so-called imperial [arrest mandate], the people of Konstanz are treated almost like outlaws by the people of Überlingen and other neighbors, while they are still waiting hourly for a response from Emperor Charles V! They are exposed to great dangers, and no one shows any sympathy for this distressed Joseph!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Blarer had Gabriel Arnold deliver Bullinger's message. He also gave his cousin Konrad Zwick Bullinger's letter to read.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Recently, he wanted to know from Bullinger (but perhaps he has not yet received the letter [No. 3088]) what the Zurich council would decide regarding a marriage between cousins. Bullinger should respond with the next messenger available to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] He prays for the people of Konstanz, who are deprived of any human help and shamefully harassed by their neighbors, so that they may remain strong and never doubt the help of the heavenly Father, whose one hand is as powerful as thousands of soldiers. May Christ glorify his name and reveal his power in them, who are despised by all as powerless, so that everyone may recognize that all authority has been given to him by the Father, that he is King over kings and ruler over rulers, so that all may understand that they must submit to him if they do not want to incur the Father's wrath and go astray! May the people of Konstanz triumph through Christ, the avenger and redeemer, and triumph over the world and its prince, the devil!</p>

      <p>The very kind and courteous Hospinianus delivered your letters to us, whom it greatly pains that neither for your recommendation nor for his own dignity was it possible to conduct matters, as far as it concerns me. He did not come at a convenient time. I was seized by severe stomach pains, so much so that I had to relieve myself frequently and could not go anywhere, not even to the temple, so another had to take my place in preaching today. Moreover, he came and went so quickly that I could barely greet the good and learned man with a word or two. He affirms that he will soon leave again after lunch with the companions he brought along. Therefore, my venerable Bullinger, there is no reason for you to be angry with me either for neglecting hospitality and courtesy towards Hospinianus or for these brief letters, since the constraints of time have entirely dictated it so.</p>

      <p>Regarding our affairs, since nothing new has happened, I write nothing. Due to this so-called imperial ban, now even by the people of Überlingen and other neighbors, we are almost denied water and fire, while in the meantime, we are hourly expecting what response will be given by the Emperor. We are indeed exposed to great dangers, and no one appears anywhere who pities the distress of this Joseph.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I have taken care to inform Arnold of what you wrote. I also sent your letters to my cousin to be read.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I wrote to you recently, earnestly asking that you inform me at the first opportunity what is pronounced by your people regarding the marriage union between third-degree relatives. But perhaps my letters have not yet reached you. When you receive them, I earnestly beseech you to respond at the next opportunity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Pray for us, my dearest Bullinger, who are deprived of all human aid and exposed to the reproach and persecution of all our neighbors, that we may endure bravely, never doubting the help of the heavenly Father, whose one hand is as powerful as many thousands of armed soldiers. O most gracious Savior Jesus Christ, may your name be magnified in us! May your power be perfected in our weakness, which is despised by all, so that all may understand that all authority has been given to you by the Father and that you alone are the King of kings and Lord of lords, whom unless the kings of the earth and judges kiss, they will have your Father angry and thus perish from the way. Come, be present with your most powerful divine presence, our avenger and savior, that through you we may also triumph gloriously, who have long since triumphed over the world and its prince.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
