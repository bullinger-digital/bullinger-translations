      <p>Venerable, highly learned, especially dear brother-in-law, my friendly, willing service is always at your best disposal. Following my most recent letter, I am sending you with the bearers of this letter a small barrel with a very good salmon, which just came from the Rhine on Pentecost evening and was slaughtered and salted in my presence. You and my dear sister, along with your beloved sons and daughters, should eat it; however, when you open the barrel, you should not handle the fish with bare hands, but rather lift it out with clean knives, so that the brine inside does not break and remains fresh; for this is the nature of the fish, that it should be handled cleanly and kept in the cellar, etc. And I inform you herewith that I and my household (thank God) live in reasonable health, which we always wish to hear from you and my dear sister, as well as from all of yours. Otherwise, my situation is once again quite poor; for the deceitful, cunning man carries out his legal practices to such an extent that I hear and find out about them every day with particular disadvantage. I hoped it would soon be over, but it seems to me that it is just beginning, as he has obtained from the imperial majesty that he should be reinstated in his property until the legal proceedings are concluded, but that he should not change anything about the annual usage. He accepted this at mid-Lent and had to swear his old heavy oath anew, and although he is in great danger and under serious observation, where he might be caught in any transgression, he nevertheless wants to have his dwelling and being under the lords of the land and with their subjects, with whom he has been in legal dispute for over five years on both sides, first daring to pawn the house at Nollingen before the clarification of the law, which is still unpaid, and to meet the peasants or successors in daily disputes over the goods with few good words, but rather with highly pretentious, boastful speeches, and thus bend and shatter his supposed fortune, as has happened before, like a little bell into a sieve. Therefore, I once again do not know what to do; for I can no longer serve anyone in this area, neither noble nor common, who have dealings in the surrounding villages, and must therefore withdraw from his ways if I want to have peace otherwise. And since things are happening so unexpectedly, I would once again find your brotherly advice in this matter very necessary. I could not withhold all this from you to inform you of my concerns and brotherly opinion. I hereby commend you to the Almighty, and greet my dear sister and your people for me. My wife and children send you all friendly greetings.</p>
      <p>Dated Rheinfelden on the 13th day of June in the year 1560. Your willing servant Hanns Adlischwyler, citizen of Rheinfelden.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, highly learned master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my dear brother-in-law.</p>
