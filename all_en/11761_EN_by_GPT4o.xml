    <p xml:id="regest1">Has nothing to report except the attached news; Erasmus [Ritter] can report orally what he heard on the journey; we will certainly see the downfall of the Christians who fight each other while the Turk effortlessly takes control; may God assist the believers; the day of the Lord is near. The unfortunate evildoer C[aspar] S[chwenckfeld] is once again spreading writings against the "Creaturists," in which he claims to defend the glory and majesty of Christ; he has dedicated the writing "On the divine glory of the humanity of Christ in the glory testimony from the New Testament" to the Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse], in which he does not achieve his purpose of refuting the creatureliness of Christ; nevertheless, he harms the Church - may God free it from him and similar sectarians! Greetings, especially to R[udolf] Gwalther, whom he has not yet been able to write to. [Enclosure:] News about the Turkish campaign, the JÃ¼lich-Cleves war, about [Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle and Emperor [Charles V]; the reform attempts of the [Arch-]Bishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied] and the Bishop of Strasbourg [Erasmus Schenk von Limpurg] are being held up by various factors.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Apart from the things you will read here, I have nothing to write to you, venerable Bullinger, dearest brother in the Lord, especially since our Erasmus [Ritter] here can serve as a living letter to you, faithfully narrating everything he heard throughout the journey. Certainly, we see such a web being woven in the Christian world, from which inevitable destruction threatens. Christians will fall by their own mutual swords for a while, until the Turk effortlessly takes control of our affairs. Ah, our deplorable fate, perpetually to be lamented by all the pious, who confidently ignore these great dangers that threaten everyone, and fight cruelly and with more than gladiatorial spirits for things which we cannot preserve unless the common enemy of the Christians is first defeated. But such is our merit, who consider nothing before that true and solid repentance, by which we return to grace with the Lord, without whose help whatever we attempt in human or divine affairs will succeed in vain and unhappily.</p>
      <p>Let us earnestly pray to the Father of mercies, that with His little flock He may transfer us as soon as possible into His heavenly kingdom; here, outside of a thousand deaths and certain dangers, there is nothing further to expect, so much do we see evils being heaped upon evils to the utmost sorrow of all good people every day. The great day of the Lord is approaching and at the door, I have no doubt, on which heaven and earth will be shaken in a dreadful manner; let us therefore lift up our heads, hastening our redemption as much as we can, and with the spirit and the bride crying out: "Come, Lord Jesus" [Rev 22:20]. Amen.</p>
      <p>That unfortunate evildoer and perpetually driven by some intemperance, Caspar Schwenckfeld, is once again spreading new pamphlets against the "Creaturists," as he calls them, where he seems to assert very magnificently and strongly the glory and majesty of Christ, which he claims is obscured by our doctrine. He is now writing a work to the Landgrave, which he titled: "On the Divine Glory of the Humanity of Christ in the Glory Testimony from the New Testament," where, according to us, he writes what is best, yet in the meantime he does not prove that Christ is not a creature, that is, that he did not begin at some point nor is the same as God himself, the flesh of Christ. Nevertheless, he greatly inconveniences our churches with his remarkable slipperiness, by which he balances himself with incredible skill, so that wherever you try to grasp him, he slips away. May the Lord maturely free His church from this and other little sectarians, to whom we, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, always diligently commend you with all your fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>Greet, as you can, all the brothers and friends, especially Mr. Rosti, the consul, with his wife and your whole household, especially also our Rudolf Gwalther, to whom neither leisure nor phlegm has allowed me to write. All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>January 30, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours, Amb. Bl.</p>
      <p>To the very distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of Zurich, incomparable friend and much venerable and dearest brother.</p>
