    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the records of the Diet of Schmalkalden and, despite some reservations, is pleased with the outcome; the opinion presented there contributes more to the understanding between [the Swiss and the Lutheran churches] than all of Bucer's efforts, and perhaps the reservations [of the Swiss] were exaggerated; he encloses the records again. Comments on the rumor of a letter in which he is said to have attacked Bucer: Bucer responded to his dedication preface to [Johannes] Travers [No. 1283] with a sharp apology, but he himself has not yet seen it and has only heard about it from Bern; Gryn√§us and Bibliander have already tried to appease the people of Strasbourg, and he himself intends to respond with moderation once he has read the letter. Greetings. Is in a hurry.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I give you, venerable Ambrosius and my dearest brother, truly the greatest thanks for those records from the Diet of Schmalkalden. I understand how much you love me and how much our church is dear to your heart, although I have never doubted your care and affection for us. We also give thanks to our most merciful Father and Lord, who has inspired our leaders with the mind and spirit to consult piously and prudently on matters of faith and religion.</p>
      <p>We all appreciate the sincerity and freedom. May the Lord increase His gifts to His people and confirm in them what He has begun successfully. We too have been freed from great fear and grave anxiety. However, there are a few things in the confession and apology that we wish had been placed more circumspectly. Those decisions about images seem unworthy of such learned and serious men. But such lapses seem to be overlooked until the spirit of the Lord and the times provide better. What they have consulted and decided about church property, the mass, the authority, and the episcopate of the pope, we found very pleasing. I have copied most of it hastily amidst a crowd of business. And certainly, after reading this consultation, the minds of our people are more inclined towards the ministers of the lower church than Bucer has inclined them with many years and actions until now. We have never wanted to separate ourselves and our churches from good men and churches sincerely seeking and confessing the truth. But some seemed to handle this matter of light more obscurely; hence, love cooled in us. Perhaps we were so unrefined and suspicious that we could not understand the not unsuccessful business that they were conducting with good zeal. We are sending back the records here, as you requested, and if there is anything that we can accomplish with our efforts for you, we are entirely yours.</p>
      <p>I have never written a letter against Bucer to Comander. However, I wrote a letter to Travers, which I prefixed to Vadianus's letter on the incarnation of the Lord and Vigilius's book. Bucer believes it was published in the church of Strasbourg and wrote an apology to Comander, indeed a criticism so harsh that good men grieve for my sake. I have not seen the apology. Some people from Bern have read it and warned me about it. But see, my dearest Blaurer, how undeservedly Bucer does me an injury. He interprets as written about himself what I said in general; I did not privately slander anyone. Indeed, when I heard that Bucer suspected that our writings were published against him, I cleared myself in a letter to Grynaeus, and I do not doubt that he did his duty. Our Bibliander also wrote to Sturm and Capito about this matter and cleared me. They replied that the matter was well. But nevertheless, as I hear, he writes a very harsh letter against me, which is not read by the one to whom it was written, but by the people of Bern, among whom it is written and rewritten without my knowledge, to whom the accusation was primarily to be written. However, as you advise, I will restrain myself for the present until a copy of the apology is offered; there are those who have promised it to me. I have nothing from the Curia, etc. And when it is offered and read, I will value the peace of the church more than my reputation, although then too I will do what I consider to be my duty.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me. Greet Zviccium and the brothers diligently. Pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>Very quickly; for I was not allowed to reread. May 25, 1540.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Ambrosius Blaurer, the most vigilant overseer of the church of Constance, most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
