      <p>S. D. I am sending the terms of peace as I received them from Mr. Beza and Calvin, with the condition that you return them.</p>
      <p>Aurelia writes on March 29th that Beza could have composed better if some had used the help of the Lord, and indeed these articles are accepted by some, rejected by others.</p>
      <p>It is written from Strasbourg that the terms of peace have been accepted, and therefore the mother-in-law of Cond√©, along with her children, is being brought back to France by noble knights sent from France with joy; meanwhile, since the Parisians oppose peace and almost all the papists in other places, the army has not yet been disbanded, but will soon be disbanded once matters are settled.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with His people!</p>
      <p>It is written from England that everything is safe and happy, thanks be to God.</p>
      <p>They are now celebrating the parliament of the kingdom in London; 7 who plotted against the life of the queen have been executed; severe edicts are being established against the queen's rebels in England; woe to the bishops and prelates! In Scotland, all is well, except that the Guise queen still holds mass against the will of the princes, and indeed alone.</p>
      <p>Two months ago, a court preacher of the Prussian prince, Georg Weigel, a pious and very learned man, most dear to the prince, came here; he has formed a friendship with us, etc.</p>
      <p>He debated with Brentius by the prince's order, etc.; it is a long story; I do not have the leisure to write.</p>
      <p>I will send some of his writings, but ensure you return them safely.</p>
      <p>If you could see where the opposition against the Elector on the Rhine comes from, you would see how we might articulate the truth against these unruly, rebellious scoundrels.</p>
      <p>Whether a response should be made to these slanderous articles and the lies should be refuted in their faces, I will consider.</p>
      <p>Oh, if I had more leisure, time, and strength and were not so oppressed that I can hardly speak, etc.! But the Lord will provide counsel.</p>
      <p>I am also sending the prince's catechism and give it as a gift to your sister, an excellent matron.</p>
      <p>Return the booklet on the breaking of bread; if copies have been brought from Frankfurt, I will ensure you have them.</p>
      <p>What would happen if the armament in the German lands went to Milan to bring it back under the empire and Maximilian, and the Italians helped? There is some murmuring about this matter, I do not know what.</p>
      <p>I affirm nothing certain about this matter; but I do see that a hidden meal is being cooked.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with us and protect us from all evil!</p>
      <p>Greet your sister, brother, nephews, and all friends; all of mine send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, on St. George's Day, 1563.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Ambrosius Blaurer in Leutmerken in Thurgau, my honorable lord and dearest brother.</p>
