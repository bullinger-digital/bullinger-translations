    <p xml:id="regest1">Cited from Capito's unsatisfactory response to the doubts he expressed regarding a [Communion] concord with the Lutherans. Does not accept Capito's objection that a passage criticized by Myconius from Erasmus' ["Ecclesiastes"] corresponds to the expression of the Church Fathers, and provides further quotes from the controversial writing. Has rather reluctantly supported a decision to renew the university. The dispute with Karlstadt is settled; however, careless remarks, like those made by Leo [Jud], arouse new suspicion and should therefore be avoided.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I wrote to Capito a few days ago about my despair regarding Lutheran concord. His response, in my judgment, was so childish that I gave the letters to Dr. Grynaeus to read, in case I did not understand what he had written. However, Grynaeus felt the same as I did. I will only say this: "Luther asserts a corporal presence, you say. So what? Does not divinity also dwell corporally in Christ? Corporality, therefore, is not always mathematical; it can be heavenly and divine." See what he says, as if Luther means what Capito does and not rather understands it corporally, essentially, and really.</p>
      <p>Regarding Erasmus' opinion, which also seems tolerable to you, he warns not to act rashly. He says that the form of speaking is that of the Church Fathers, which we should imitate, let alone tolerate. At the beginning, I do not argue about the formula of reading or silence, but about Erasmus' words, so that they may be accepted by adversaries in the future. Then, if we never remembered the Church Fathers in the matter of the Eucharist, I believe Luther would already be defeated. But since we fall back on the Fathers here and elsewhere, I fear a very serious downfall. Nor is it for anyone to say: We accept them when they agree with us. This is indeed the objection of the papists: Where they please, they accept; where they displease, they reject. Therefore, these pseudo-evangelicals are vain and worthless men. The papists will eventually leave as victors. We accept the Fathers because they agree with the word of God and as the word of God contains. Why then do we not contend with the word instead? But these are futile matters concerning Erasmus. Listen to him, as he says elsewhere: "In the ecclesiastical hierarchy, the highest dignity is that of the bishops. Of whom, since there are many functions, among which the chief are the administration of the sacraments and spiritual doctrine, the pinnacle of dignity is reached whenever they feed the minds of the people with the flesh and blood of Christ, which is the word of God." And elsewhere: "Indeed, the mystical scripture is the living bread that came down from heaven, which grants eternal life to those who partake." And a little later: "Finally, that scripture is the flesh of Christ, truly food, is the blood of Christ, truly drink, from which unless the hearts of the people are daily nourished and refreshed by the ecclesiastics, they cannot sustain life, I say, true life," etc. What can you do with this trickster? I am forced to tolerate what he writes without the Fathers, while he thus foxes around!</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we are entirely focused on restoring our university. I do not know what will finally happen. We are debating whether it would be sufficient if lectures on good letters, philosophy, honest arts, and professions were given, as is the case with you, in Strasbourg, in Nuremberg, and elsewhere, or whether it is more honorable to maintain the form of a university with degrees, disputations, privileges, and whatever else is attached. We conclude that the university should be maintained, even while all authority is from the Pope through the Emperor. I agree, because it is necessary. These things I confide to you.</p>
      <p>Finally, I implore you and all yours not to write to us about either our discord or concord, especially to him. For when you write, all suspicion falls on me, as if I am inciting you. Recently, someone from among you wrote that he would gladly visit Basel, if he did not fear that more sadness than joy would arise for him from the dissension between Myconius and Karlstadt. The letters were read among good men, who were utterly astonished at the mention of dissension, as they thought everything had long been settled, as indeed it is. It certainly pains me that a scruple is introduced where there was no longer any scruple. There is no dissension, except what such people stir up, as if it were new, which it is not. Men who are friends in appearance vex me when they hear this: "What if you were to invite Karlstadt to you, so that it would be clear there are no enmities between you? For if you do not do this, it will cause trouble at some point." I say: "What do you know of our discord and enmities, of which I am aware of nothing? If Karlstadt has anything against me, let him speak; there is nothing for me to complain about. That I do not invite him is common with others. Not everyone agrees with my table." Meanwhile, I have decided to ignore everything. There is no hatred, no envy, thank God, but I cannot trust the treacherous, though I can do good. But I will stop, it is time. Keep these things among your own, but in general, you will still advise that no one even dreams of our discord. Do not say a word about the letters written by Leo; for I know there would be reproaches, and from these, something even worse. You should not know any of these last things. It will be safe if you consign them to Vulcan.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ with yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 15, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>I commend to you this sister of mine and her brother-in-law.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the people of Zurich, brother in his Lord.</p>
