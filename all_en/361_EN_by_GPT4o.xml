      <p>Greetings. I received your letter on the 8th of December, which was very pleasing to me for many reasons: partly because it clearly showed your love for me, and partly because it contained information about the state of the country and your father's health. I had already sent my letters to you via the royal couriers; however, to let you know that I received your latest letter, I thought it necessary to briefly respond to yours, in case a response seemed required. My father himself has confirmed in writing that he has reconciled with me; now, since your letter also mentioned this, I easily understand that his attitude has not changed. If my parents consider the reasons for my departure without any bias, I have no doubt that they will say I have not failed in my duty as a son. As for the expenses I have incurred, I cannot write anything certain at this time due to the departure, which the couriers hastened. Furthermore, Martin Besard's journey, as he will return from Picardy by the feast of Christ's nativity; I have given him a note with the total amount. Additionally, I need to settle accounts with my companions and ask Martin to return the money he entrusted to me for safekeeping and how much he wants to give for the journey. The total amount of all I have spent and what will be necessary for preparing the journey will be around 24 crowns. Although this sum is large, if one considers the time since I left Zurich and all my expenses and the time I had to stay during the journey, it will be considered moderate. And this sum should also be the limit and total of all my expenses. However, since I could not winter in Aquitaine due to the Aquitanian uprising, I easily perceive it will not be in my interest to undertake this journey again, nor to stay longer in Paris, where no confession of Christ is heard openly.</p>
      <p>Especially if I wish to obey my parents' advice and not forget my father's religion. I have therefore decided to travel to Lausanne, partly to endure the winter's cold and partly because of the Lenten fast, which is most consecrated by papal abominations. For if there is any danger, it threatens the true religion's confessors most at that time, and the papal sword has raged most fiercely then. If I stay in Lausanne, I do not think it will be displeasing to my parents because of the confession of religion. For I can travel there with little expense and join companions whose company will improve me. There, if it seems appropriate, I will learn the rudiments of the holy language, and with the coming of spring, I can explore Italy, which is frequently mentioned in all histories, and thus dedicate myself entirely to the holy studies of theology. For I can easily discern the dignity and excellence of sacred studies if I compare them with philosophy and papal darkness. It is also, in my judgment, useful and fruitful to have observed the followers of both religions. However, I will leave everything to your judgment. I wanted to write to you about the course of my journey and studies so that you see I have received your letters and will not fail in my duty as a dutiful son. I have nothing new to report that would be worthy of you. The royal courtiers who are at the king's court can inform you better about all matters, and I cannot promise to write in the future about what is happening in Paris, as I see I must hasten my journey due to suitable companions. However, I will have certain people from whom I will always inform you of what is happening in Paris when I learn of it.</p>
      <p>If it seems appropriate to you, you can report this to my parents and tell them in my words that I will not fail in my duty. I understand my father's love for me through many not insignificant arguments, which alone will easily keep me in my duty. May the supreme ruler of all minds grant that I may someday meet expectations.</p>
      <p>I will send you a calculation of expenses shortly, and to whom money should be given, after I learn from Martin to whom he wants to give it; he may have certain people in Switzerland to whom he wants to pay the money. But so as not to trouble you more with my matters, I will now end. May God deign to keep you safe for a long time for our church.</p>
      <p>I wish my parents and your entire family to be well. Paris, December 8, 1548.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and expect very detailed letters about all matters, the state of the city, my studies, expenses, and journey.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Ludwig Lavater of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant moderator of the Zurich church, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father. Zurich. To Mr. Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
