      <p>Greetings. It is not my fault, dearest Bullinger, that anything should be feared by me, as far as the exact understanding of the controversy is concerned, that in your undoubtedly most learned and pious letters to the brother ministers anything has been omitted.</p>
      <p>I have neither read nor indeed seen them; but I know what I should promise myself about your and your colleagues' erudition. For this one reason, I thought it should be delayed, so that if you had been informed a little more extensively by your Vadianus (whose faith is most well-known among the people of Zürich) about the state of the matter, you might have been able to write a little more prudently. Forbid it, forbid it, that any of you should think that my judgment should be awaited, so that he may proceed to either amend or moderate his own from it. For it cannot be carried with such confidence, that he desires his own to be examined and approved not by his own, but by the judgment of those to whom he writes; for as far as the outcome of the case is concerned, it would not matter to me, provided that the parties are reconciled in such a way from equity and justice, that what is from the law of Scripture may seem to have been ratified by the judges. For my part, dear Bullinger, everything will be immediately white, even if something different happens; for it is enough for me that I have redeemed both my faith and my conscience. Nevertheless, I am sending you my letters a little earlier, even if written late, so that you may understand the whole matter even late and at the same time have my judgment on the whole matter (which you eagerly desired) at hand, not for the reason that you amend yours, but that you correct mine. I would have sent them sooner, if I had had the opportunity of trustworthy messengers. I have added letters from Gessner from Augsburg to Gessner of Zürich and also a letter from Laelius Conzini from Nuremberg along with others, which you sent to me in recent days. Do not doubt at all that I will be the most observant inspector of the Augsburg meetings. Farewell. St. Gallen, July 19, 1550.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, lord and brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
