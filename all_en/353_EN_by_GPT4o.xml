      <p>To the man endowed with the highest religion, virtue, and knowledge of the best arts, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Archbishop of the citizens of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and teacher, Johannes von Ulm sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Although I never doubted, most learned and dearest man, that you still have the same mind towards me in my absence as you showed me when I was there; I could not help but rejoice greatly when I learned the same from Augustin; for he told me that your love for me is so strong and great that if he had visited your house before his departure to us, you would have decided to recommend me to the Archbishop of the English with some testimony of your voice. How grateful that would have been to me in this sad and difficult time of mine, I can neither express in words nor letters, and, what is more, not even in any thought. Truly (which I wish you to believe me affirming) I would have judged that a happier day had hardly dawned for me in a long time. Since, however, Augustin, using some (in my judgment) unfortunate and afflicted fortune, took a different route than through Zürich, I am nevertheless assured that you are endowed with such fairness and constancy of mind that there is no place for favor with you; but you are accustomed, according to your singular prudence and justice, to consider what the matter and cause itself demands, not what men desire. Therefore, you should know that the state of my studies and life is such that unless you assist with that salutary recommendation of yours, I greatly fear that their very safety is almost at stake. Trehern, indeed, a man distinguished by virtue and learning, has offered me his faith and service excellently and readily; but even so, in your own judgment, it seems that this is certainly of little benefit to my studies: for he thinks that I should establish the course of my life in the king's court, and he has long affirmed that he has found a generous and ample stipend for me: but I say again and again that this cannot be done without the greatest danger to my studies. Therefore, all remaining hope is in you, who I know can help me greatly in this matter: for I know the outstanding strength and industry of your speed; I also know the weight and strength of your authority and counsel, which if you exert in this matter, I will judge you to have fulfilled the duty of a truly Christian man. I ask you again and again, for your singular benevolence towards me, that if anything comes to your mind that seems to be of benefit and use to our leisure, you undertake some thought and action of this matter. I would address you with more words, if I did not doubt that you are willing for my sake, and indeed the matter itself speaks sufficiently for itself. Just know that if I understand that you have taken care of this matter for me at this time, you will someday receive great pleasure from your duty: nor will it be the last of your praises, that you alone of all have brought me, miserably abandoned in the very midst of the waves, to port by the breeze of your recommendation, having been carried aloft by the work of others. So much for this.</p>
      <p>There is nothing to write about the state of England, except that it flourishes and excels to the highest dignity of the gospel, and strives to free and extricate itself more and more from all crime and error every day. The general council, which they call the parliament, has been convened, begun, but not yet finished.</p>
      <p>If it has decided on any principal matters, and if I have anything else new, anything more certain, I will diligently and in detail write to you with the first messenger.</p>
      <p>Prejudices about the most holy supper of Jesus Christ have been rightly and excellently made by the leaders: that vile error and gross opinion about σαρκοφαγίᾳ (cannibalism) has long been banished, and is sent to the crows.</p>
      <p>That Thomas too, about whom I wrote to you when I was in London, by the kindness of God and the work of Mr. Johannes a Lasco, a man of the most upright and excellent judgment, has been much freed from his difficult disease καταφόρᾳ (consumption).</p>
      <p>The day before yesterday, the emperor's envoys arrived here with great (in their judgment) glory and pomp. Meanwhile, they wish to offer their little gift, worthy of all (if the gods please) the gospel (I do not affirm for certain, I have nothing beyond hearsay), to the king of the English: with what gift the king will reward them is still uncertain; undoubtedly, not greatly, I wish as similarly as possible! The same envoys are said to intercede with the king on behalf of the Bishop of Winchester and other masked doctors: what they will finally achieve with their puffing, God, whose cause it is, will see: know this one thing, the more eagerly truth is oppressed and hidden by them, the more it shines and appears: for at that very time, in a good part of England, those meritorious altars have been utterly and completely exterminated from the borders of men by the common consent of the greatest men. And what more? Those whorish altars have been made sties, that is, dwellings for swine and beasts. Cox, the king's instructor, a man endowed with a certain high mind, and adorned with the highest power, sharpness of intellect, and authority, indeed thinks and breathes most excellently and rightly about every article of the Christian religion; if he had not so liberally taken me, afflicted and destitute of all hope, into his faith and to help and console me most humanely, I would have long since had to follow Trehern's advice: for he alone resisted, and extended to me the royal faith and right hand, for which greatest and immortal benefit I can find neither form nor way of giving thanks, deterred by some rustic modesty. Therefore, you will do me a most pleasing favor, it is difficult to speak, and you know what I mean: but let it be said plainly: I wish that you would, with your letters adorned with words, thank him on my behalf, and that he would embrace me, once received into his faith, with his perpetual zeal and love; which indeed he alone of all can do most, either by the right and power he has here, or by the counsel and authority he wields everywhere. I ask you again and again to take care of this. But how, you ask? In whatever way you please; for in whatever direction you write, the letters will be more pleasing to him in silence: moreover, as he delights in the friendship of the most learned men, so he rejoices in the memory and testimony of good men about himself; nor would you begin any argument of writing that is not apt and suitable to one of his most outstanding virtues. If you write familiarly and domestically, you will seem to have regard for his highest humanity; if with honor and gravely, you will seem to have regard for his most eminent dignity: but which he rejoices in more, it is difficult to say: this indeed is not at all doubtful, your letters will be most pleasing in whatever manner.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man in every kind of virtue, and have me commended to you for your zeal in Christ, for whose sake I hope you will do everything.</p>
      <p>Having written these, not yet given, I received the most terrible news of the destruction of the city of Constance. O bitter and difficult to endure event! For they say that on the 18th of October it was again attacked by the Spaniards in war, captured by force, and finally utterly and completely, that is, leveled to the ground and eradicated. O wicked men, foaming out their own wickedness from their mouths, and breathing cruelty from their deepest chest!</p>
      <p>Indeed, I lack words to express my grief to you, which perhaps should be restrained. For I know, I say I know, that you have drawn so much grief from it, as hardly any day can exhaust, or that voracious Charybdis of the poets can swallow. Therefore, I will not allow my own mourning to be added to your infinite sorrow. I will only ask you, as you do most diligently of your own accord, to consider that all these human things, whatever they are, must be borne wisely and bravely, you who are devoted to the study of wisdom above others, and endowed with such strength of mind that whatever the common people admire or fear, you yourself, if you set your mind to it, can despise and scorn. You will easily set your mind to it, if, as I know you do and teach, you always remember that theology itself is nothing else but a perpetual meditation on death. That time will come, that day will dawn, when these most foolish men will pay the penalties of their crimes in the underworld: but we will attain the seat and place of the pious, in which all things are filled with great and outstanding men, with the highest praise and glory. Ἑχθπῶυ γὰρ ἀυδρῶυ μοῖραν εὶσ ἀναστροφἡν δαῖμωνδδÂωσι, κο [...].</p>
      <p>O happy day and awaited hour, when freed from all the injuries of our enemies, we will arrive in heaven, as in our home and perpetual dwelling, where the blessed enjoy eternal life; once this journey is completed, there will be no remaining care, no anxiety! Therefore, farewell again, and be of strong and great spirit.</p>
      <p>Oxford, 27 November, 1548.</p>
      <p>The letters which you see written to Johann Wolphius, I wish you to ensure they are delivered to him as soon as possible; and give my very best regards to Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
