    <p xml:id="regest1">Will follow the decision shared by [Johann Jakob] Ammann of the school authorities and leave Basel; [John] Butler, who is traveling to Frankfurt due to the critical developments in England, will accompany him, but this must not be known to anyone. Is surprised that Ammann was appointed as his advocate [with the school authorities], and emphasizes his special connection with Bullinger. Greetings. The manners of the Fraumünster students leave much to be desired.</p>

      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Rudolf Gwalther.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have understood the decision of our school authorities, most kind father, from Ammann's letters. I will ensure that I do not appear to have been disobedient to their decision, and as soon as I have the opportunity, I will leave Basel and will not stay there for more than eight days, and that for the sake of Mr. Butler, whom I will accompany as far as Frankfurt. However, I would not want you to inform anyone of this until Butler has returned from Frankfurt; for no one, not even in Basel, knows of his departure except me alone. Alas, the affairs of the English are, as they say, on the razor's edge. An Englishman came to him these days, sent here from England on his behalf, whom he immediately sent away with letters; he himself will now follow to Frankfurt, where some Englishmen (as I suppose), pious men and not unknown to me, will meet him, whom I certainly fear to be exiles. These are, as you see, the trials of the world and its rulers. However, for my sake, do not disclose this to anyone, lest I be given the occasion to be reproached for it. I write this to you alone, whom I have recognized as my most faithful father.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, however, it troubles my mind not a little that Ammann has been appointed as my patron. I cannot understand the reason for this with wonder. He is a good man, but not so familiar to me that I would dare to entrust the office of a patron to him as freely as to you. Nevertheless, I will do what they wish. I only ask that you do not remove your parental affection towards me. For I acknowledge you alone as the refuge of my affairs and fortunes, which if denied to me, certainly neither letters nor service to the fatherland would be of any use to me in the future. But as long as I see you as my father, I will ensure that I cannot justly be accused of any fault.</p>
      <p>Mr. Myconius and Grynaeus send their greetings to you. Please convey my greetings to your entire family.</p>
      <p>I would certainly like you to believe me that the young men of the Fraumünster College would be better instructed in civil manners if you intend to achieve praise through them among foreigners; but I would not want anyone to know that this has been communicated to you by me.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most kind father, and keep me commended to you. Basel, 17th of the calends of June 1540.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant head of the church of Zurich, his most esteemed father.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
