    <p xml:id="regest1">The recipients are certainly aware of how disgracefully Luther expressed himself in his ["Short Confession"] about the [Zürich Church] and also about the deceased. Therefore, Bullinger sends the ["True Confession"] of the [Zürich] Church and asks not to condemn their writings unread, especially since some want to suppress and prohibit them. [The people of Zürich] have been innocently and without legitimate cause reviled by Luther and condemned as manifest heretics who do not acknowledge any articles of faith, so it would only be fair to also hear their response. - Bullinger requests a favorable reception of his letter and the [enclosed] booklet.</p>

      <p>Pious, honorable, prudent, esteemed and wise, gracious dear lords, my willing service, friendly greetings and all good things be ready for your wisdom beforehand.</p>
      <p>How disgracefully and horrifically Dr. Martin Luther has written against our church, which we serve, against us, and also against deceased, pious, honorable, learned people of the past year, is known to everyone. Therefore, I can well imagine that such his writing has also come to your attention.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I am sending you here, in a very friendly and good intention, our church's confession of faith, defense, and innocence, and I ask for God's sake, that you may also hear us and, if Dr. Luther has slandered us with his inappropriate writing in your presence, that our appropriate and decent writing may be properly assessed by you. And although we are confident in all friendliness, appropriateness, and fairness towards you, since some threaten that our books must be suppressed and forbidden, I ask in the name of all servants of the church here in Zürich, for God's sake, for justice and divine truth, that you do not consent to such inappropriate intentions, if it is brought to you, and do not allow that our books be condemned unheard. Dr. Luther has reviled us and ours without any of our guilt and without legitimate cause, and condemned us as manifest heretics, indeed as the worst people who do not believe any article of faith, etc. It is only fair that our response and innocence be heard against this. And if you graciously hear us in this matter, we hope that God will richly repay it. For if we could ever show our gratitude to you with humble services, we would do so very faithfully and willingly.</p>
      <p>With this, I humbly and friendly ask you to graciously and willingly receive this my writing along with the booklet from your willing servant and to accept it favorably. May Almighty God faithfully keep you and yours in His grace.</p>
      <p>Dated Zürich in the Confederation, 12th of March in the year of our Lord 1545. Your always willing</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, servant of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable, prudent, esteemed and wise lords, mayors and council in Frankfurt am Main, my gracious, dear lords.</p>
