    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger has nothing special to report, except that he would like to give Blarer the opportunity to write again with his letter. He has answered all of Blarer's letters and is now eagerly awaiting the next dispatch.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Various rumors are being spread about the health condition of the tyrannical and incompetent King Ferdinand as well as about the condition of Emperor Charles V, a cunning man who has been favored by fate in an unchristian manner more than enough. Some people claim that the Bohemians have taken up arms again. Bullinger does not know if this is true. Many assume that the city of Strasbourg, by far the most fortified within the German Empire, will open its doors to the Emperor in light of the plague now spreading in Augsburg, and that the latter will go there under the pretext of the Imperial Diet. If only he would never come out of there alive again! Indeed, this may be a foolish wish. Well, God's will be done! One should incessantly implore Him for mercy. Otherwise, there is no news.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Blarer, along with his family, is greeted. He should inform what happened with that Spaniard [...] mentioned by Bullinger in the last letter [No. 3014]. Jakob Zorn persistently claims that he was able to grab the bridle with his hand and briefly interrupt the man's gallop before the rein broke and the Spaniard escaped to the Kreuzlingen Gate, where he encountered a halberdier.</p>

      <p>Various rumors are being spread here about the health condition of both King Ferdinand, that tyrant and most incompetent man, and Emperor Charles V, a most cunning man and unchristianly fortunate beyond measure. There are also those who say that the Bohemians have taken up arms again. I do not know what is true. Many believe that the plague now spreading in Augsburg will cause Strasbourg, by far the most fortified stronghold in Germany, to open its gates to the Emperor, who will enter under the pretext of the Imperial Diet. If only he would never come out alive! But perhaps these are foolish wishes of our emotions. Well, may God's will be done, and may He be incessantly implored to have mercy on us. We have no other news.</p>

      <p>Farewell eternally, along with all your family, and let me know what happened with that Spaniard I wrote to you about in my last letter. For Jakob Zorn persistently claims that he grabbed the bridle with his hand and intercepted the galloping man, although the Spaniard broke free when the rein snapped and escaped to the Kreuzlingen Gate, where he encountered a halberdier. In ZÃ¼rich, on the day of Saint Maurice, September 22, 1547. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Ambrosius Blarer, his ever-honored and beloved brother. In Konstanz.</p>
