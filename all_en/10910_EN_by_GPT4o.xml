Together with Grynaeus, he negotiated in Strasbourg about the [Wittenberg Concord] and received an acceptable response, but cannot write in detail now; he wants to arrange for the people of Zurich to be informed by Grynaeus either in writing or orally.</p>

      <p>Greetings. In this letter, you will find, I believe, a letter from Melanchthon.</p>
      <p>Grynaeus and I were in Strasbourg; we attempted to negotiate the articles of concord and common peace of the churches. We conversed and elicited a response which, in my judgment, is both tolerable and will have significant weight towards peace. However, I do not have the time to write more fully now, as I must report on the proceedings there, and that today after lunch. I will urge Dr. Grynaeus to write everything, and I am entirely committed to ensuring that it is sent to you to explain everything. Please consider these few words kindly.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 29, 1536.</p>
      <p>Yours, Carolostadius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the primary pastor in Zurich, his most esteemed superior.</p>
