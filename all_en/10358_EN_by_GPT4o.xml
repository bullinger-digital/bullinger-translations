      <p>Christian, well-educated, honorable, gracious, dear sir, we send you our willing service in advance.</p>
      <p>Gracious, dear sir, our preacher Leonhard Bechlin, the bearer of this letter, has been accused before our gracious lords and superiors, the eight old cantons of our confederation, of having preached against the peace of the land in several articles; therefore, the bailiff with us has had to summon and accuse him according to the peace of the land. Since today our bailiff has accused him of such articles, as we send you enclosed herewith, and he acknowledges some and not others, but is nevertheless willing to answer them distinctly (precisely), as you will hear from him. So that he does not entangle himself, but rather seeks the counsel of learned people, he has called upon us for a letter of recommendation to you and requested it. Since we would not like him to be expelled from us or to suffer harm or disadvantage, we kindly ask you with diligence to be helpful and supportive to him, to show him means and ways, and to help him find a way to answer our gracious lords and superiors regarding the articles and to remain with us. For if he were to be expelled from us because of this, it would truly grieve us. We have not wanted to withhold this from you out of good intention, at his request. With this, we always willingly offer ourselves to your services and commend ourselves to your intercession.</p>
      <p>Dated the 20th day of February in the year 1534. The mayor and council of Diessenhofen.</p>
      <p>To the Christian, well-educated, worthy, and honorable sir, etc., preachers of God's word in the city of ZÃ¼rich, our gracious, dear sir.</p>
