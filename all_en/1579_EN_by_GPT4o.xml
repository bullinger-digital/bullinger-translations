      <p>Most illustrious man, may you be well. You will understand what happened in Trento on the day of Paul, when the session was to be celebrated, from Celsus and Lelio, to whom I send everything that was sent to me by the brothers from Italy. It is to be hoped that the impious and most wicked assembly and gathering of conspirators and evil men, the most bitter enemies of Christ, will soon be scattered.</p>
      <p>May our Lord God make it so! Meanwhile, whatever I am, I do not fail and I sharpen my pen, but in Italian; for I must serve that theater.</p>
      <p>Celsus is now in England. But I am troubled by his departure; for I saw great benefit returning from his sermons, so much so that he even stirred up the devil, as you will hear from him.</p>
      <p>He left me alone to minister and in disturbances and dangers. But I trust in the Lord, who can protect me.</p>
      <p>I would think it advisable if you would now write again to England about my affairs; certainly, I cannot bear the expenses any longer, and I wish I were not forced to fall to the great joy of the papists!</p>
      <p>If you can do anything, help me, indeed the cause of Christ with your authority, Heinrich Bullinger. For I will not abandon this station and will not cease to fight closely in these borders; but it is necessary that some prince supports me with his generosity and charity.</p>
      <p>I hear strange things about the rage of the papists against me. They do everything to destroy me; I speak of those who live in Rome and Venice, not so much of those among whom I live. Many brothers have warned me to be very careful. Help me with your prayers with the whole church, which I earnestly ask.</p>
      <p>But I must truly say that I feel greater annoyance from the malevolence and envy of those who are exiled for the sake of the gospel than from the rage of the impious; for they, Bullinger, do not cease to gnaw at me. And do not think this is a vice of the Italians, I affirm that this is caused by the cowl and that unfortunate education in cloisters and enclosures; for all those who rage against me were monks. May God forgive them and grant them a better mind! For suppose I were a drunkard or a fornicator (God knows who I am, indeed the world also knows), what need was there to publish so many letters to defame me everywhere? Is this the duty of a Christian man? Why do they not rather admonish me brotherly? Why do they not call me back to the way?</p>
      <p>Again I say: may God forgive them! You admonished me in such a way when I was recently present, as if I were the one who inflicted injury.</p>
      <p>But I, a wretched man, suffer, and they take it badly that I complained to some brothers and indeed with the utmost modesty. O cursed cowl, which has borne such wicked fruits of slander! Forgive the most just pain, not indeed for any other reason than that I see this matter has caused great scandal in Italy and will cause much more in the coming days.</p>
      <p>I do not cease to commend my nephews to your piety. Farewell and be well and pray for me. I greet the whole family, the church, and the school. Vicosoprano, February 27, 1552.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
