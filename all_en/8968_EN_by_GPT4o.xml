      <p>Greetings. I have received your two letters, most excellent man and honorable godfather, along with the collected writings concerning Mr. Schuler's case, as well as those new matters that recently reached you from various places. What pertained to Mr. Schuler, I returned to him in good faith, and I read and showed the rest to men whom I know to be grateful to you and very fond of you. They all, along with me, express great thanks to you and pray to God that He may deign to grant a good end to this seemingly desperate matter. For we know the cunning and crafty old age of the Albanians and their military tricks, as well as the vast resources of the Spaniards, while the exiles, who oppose them as enemies, have scant treasury and strength.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, however, this saying of the Apostle comforts us: "If God is for us, who can be against us?"</p>
      <p>We will all earnestly pray to Him to deign to redeem those unjustly oppressed for His holy name's sake and to vigorously assert the light of His eternal truth.</p>
      <p>I am deeply affected by the death of your dearest nephew, Rudolf Zwingli, of blessed memory, and this not so much on your account, as I know you have always borne the judgments and kind will of the Lord with a more equanimous mind and recognize well that this is just and salutary for us, and that the most merciful God wished in this way to free this good young man from many troubles at once, but also on account of the church, to which he could have been of service in his time with both his grandfathers and his dearest father, and could have made the illustrious Zwinglian lineage even more renowned through the ministry of Christ. But we will pray to God that soon, or whenever it seems good to His holy will, we may see him again in eternal joy. Amen.</p>
      <p>As for why I write to you less frequently and why I did not inform you that I recently received Mr. Schuler's writings, I ask you not to attribute it to negligence, but entirely to the reason that I know you are so occupied with many matters that I often refrain from bothering you with my trivialities.</p>
      <p>However, from now on, I will gladly respond briefly, as I ought. Farewell, my most esteemed father, and continue to love me and hold me in high regard. Thomas Schmid, the treasurer, Beldii, Schuler, Pfendler, and the others greet you, etc. My wife also wishes you and yours all the best.</p>
      <p>In Glarus, July 23, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted and loving Johannes Hugo of Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most vigilant minister of the Church of Zurich, my lord and as a father to me, most revered and dear.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
