    <p xml:id="regest1">Since Vadian already wrote a few days ago [No. 2400], there is only the following to report from a friend's letter [Hieronymus Sailer?].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The godless horde that cruelly massacred the Waldensians around Avignon in [April 1545] was punished early by God. As they set out with four galleys from Marseille along the Spanish coast towards England, they perished in the waves through a violent storm in November [1545].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Likewise, their captain, Capitaine Poulin, was stabbed during his stay at the court of King [Francis I] by the Florentine captain Piero Strozzi, who was on good terms with [Catherine de' Medici], the wife of the Dauphin [Henry]. What consequences this will have for Strozzi is still open.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- From Nuremberg, it was written that Emperor [Charles V] actually intends to hold the Imperial Diet in Regensburg. The [St. Gallen] council was also informed of this. Everything points to a war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- From Venice, it was written that Pope [Paul III], who harbors evil intentions, wants to move the Council of Trent to Bologna or Parma, especially since the Emperor will not be able to persuade the Germans to attend the council anyway.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Greetings.</p>

      <p>From the letters of Mr. Vadian, consul of St. Gallen, to Mr. Bullinger. The day before the Nones of April in the year 1546.</p>

      <p>How the four galleys were set on fire and burned at sea. In the year 1545. There was nothing that seemed important enough to inform you about, as I had already written to you a few days earlier, except for the following, which I learned from very trustworthy friends.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The tyrannical godless horde of soldiers, who last year cruelly massacred the poor Waldensians around Avignon along with their church servants, women, and children, have received their punishment early. For when they set out from Marseille in four galleys to sail around Spain and towards England, they were struck by lightning and thunder from heaven in November of last year, and although they were not close to each other, they were completely burned, and all the people perished, with about sixty cannons going to the bottom.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>In February of last year, their captain, named Capitaine Poulin, who had stayed for a while at the court of the king, was stabbed in France by an Italian captain from Florence named Piero Strozzi, who is of a great family and somewhat related to the wife of the Dauphin. However, whether Piero Strozzi is in the king's favor or not, one cannot know. Thus, God also dealt with this Poulin with a violent death.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>From Nuremberg, it is written that the Roman Emperor still intends to hold the Imperial Diet in Regensburg, for which reason my lords have also received a mandate. Everyone predicts war.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>From Venice, it is written that the Pope intends to transfer his council from Trent to Bologna or Parma, as the Emperor will not be able to persuade the Germans to appear there. He has poisonous arrows in his quiver and will certainly try to shoot some. May God prevent it.</p>
      <p>Farewell. St. Gallen, the day after the Nones of April in the year of our Lord 1546. Joachim Vadian.</p>
