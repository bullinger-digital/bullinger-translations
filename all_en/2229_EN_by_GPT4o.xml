      <p>I have received the letters of your kindness; I am grateful to have such a friend. May the merciful God preserve you for us for a long time. So that you may know for certain the state of affairs in Zürich (for there has been some struggle there for a while after my departure, and I left almost sooner than was appropriate; however, my lords here would have endured with equanimity if I had stayed there for another two or three weeks, provided something had been accomplished by me; but the Lord of all prevailed), I am sending you the letters written to me by Johannes Travers, and at the same time, you will understand from them how I will not cease to care for that church, as you encourage me to do. To this, I hope that shortly I will be able to write more such happy things to you. The talk of the change of our episcopal college is still on almost everyone's lips, but nothing has been attempted yet. Certainly, there are now many more in our League of God's House (for the power of the chapter lies with them) who do not have the mass than those who do, and the spirits of the priests, if ever, are now most disturbed. With whatever skill and industry I can, when it is opportune, I will inform our Travers as well as the bishop how kindly you offer yourself and promise your efforts to this, which by Hercules would be more beneficial to him and the canons than they now hope. I sent your words, transcribed from the letter sent to me, to the Bishop of Bayonne, as much as was sufficient; for I do not wish to show the letter because of the mention of the chapter in it, lest he perhaps disclose anything, etc. Since the time I acted as interpreter for Johannes Angelus Riccius, he has not summoned me to him, nor have I gone to him.</p>
      <p>He is angry with me. Many advise that I should clear myself; I reply that there is no need, as I have done nothing wrong against our republic, nor against the king, nor against him. For when asked, indeed almost commanded by the chief scribe of our city, I interpreted from the Italian language what was to be conveyed to our lords in the name of the Emperor, which has always been presented and read to our lords. I would have sinned if I had not done it, indeed I would have committed something unworthy of our city, since there was no one here who could have accomplished it. See, therefore, how small and impotent of spirit such a great man otherwise is. They think of us as slaves and chattels. I will write to the deputies in Basel next week; it was not possible now. Then I will also send money to you to be sent to the students in Engadin. Comander, Tscherner, Ponticella, and Haimius send their greetings to you; Travers instructed me to greet you in his name whenever I write to you. Farewell, most humane man, and do not cease to love your Philippus. From Chur, on the 20th of March, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your kindness, Philippus Gallicius.</p>
      <p>No news from Italy. I hear that by decree of the senate, it has been prohibited in Basel for anyone to go into military service anywhere.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man Heinrich Bullinger, his lord, most worthy of all good things, etc.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
