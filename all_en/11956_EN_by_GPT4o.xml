    <p xml:id="regest1">Reluctantly takes care of students because this task is demanding and because he often travels to treat the sick; nevertheless, he has taken in the recommended Zürcher [Jakob Kriech] because a wish from the highly revered Bullinger is a command to him. Thanks for Bullinger's response to Cochläus [„Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio“], which he will also share with his colleagues as soon as he has read it. [Pierre] Viret, Celio Secondo [Curione], and the other brethren return Bullinger's greeting.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. I do not willingly commit myself to the task of educating and instructing the youth: partly because it is a challenging and indeed difficult task to do well, and partly because the countless multitude of the sick often compels me to travel and be away from my own, and while I provide medicine, I am forced to either neglect the care of my own or not manage it as diligently. However, at your request, most learned Bullinger, I will do anything. Therefore, I have received the young man whom you recommended to me in your letters among my household, and I have promised to make it clear in his instruction how sincerely I favor all the people of Zürich and how much your recommendation is valued by me. I will speak without pretense: today, among Christians and scholars, there is no one whose piety, sincerity, and learning I admire, cherish, and love more than Bullinger alone. Therefore, you do me an injustice by asking me with prayers. Henceforth, command, and you will find me no less obedient to you than a son should be to a parent.</p>
      <p>I have received your response to Cochläus's book, and I will share it with my colleagues and brethren as soon as I have read it: before that, however, if it can be done, I will satisfy and satiate myself by reading it repeatedly. Meanwhile, I thank you, most learned man and most esteemed father, for judging me worthy of such a gift and for granting it to me. And if only I could send you something in return, since it is indeed more blessed to give than to receive. But it was not so deemed by the Lord, whose will be done. I have greeted Mr. Pierre Viret, Celio Secondo, and all the other brethren and colleagues in your name, who in turn send their greetings to you and the entire church there. Farewell well and happily. Lausanne, on the Nones of May 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Béat Comte of Donzères.</p>
      <p>To H. Bullinger, the most serious and learned man, the most vigilant and holy Antistes of the Zürich church, to be honored by me in many ways. In Zürich.</p>
