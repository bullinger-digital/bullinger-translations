      <p>The most recent of your letters, along with the sacramental response, were rightly delivered to me, for which I give you immortal thanks; for your works delight me greatly. On December 27th, I was called from the assembly to Heidelberg and returned home, intending, God willing, to set out there on January 4th. You do not know, brother, how great the indifference of our people is concerning the business of the Gospel; almost all are inflated, rash, arrogant, greedy men, and I wish they were not corrupted by adversaries. I will not mention their daily drunkenness and other such things. There is agreement on both sides about holding a colloquy, but not about the manner and time, except that it should be postponed to a suitable time, therefore to the Greek Kalends, which is also by far the most advisable. In terms of religion, everyone seeks peace, but with different intentions, some piously, some impiously. It seems to me that the business of true religion does not need the peace of the impious, nor should we make any agreements for that reason, as long as political peace is firm. The letter from Philipp Melanchthon sent to you will bring something new, unless it is covered with deceit. But I wish that man would once take courage and act manfully. I have written to him as faithfully as I could; but he sent back nothing except greetings and some speeches published in another's name. He himself is now old and by nature faint-hearted, unfit for exile; therefore, if I am not mistaken, he will easily remedy this evil by spreading the rumor of his departure.</p>
      <p>My Jonas, not yet 20 years old, married the daughter of Mauritz Bullinger in Druchtelfingen, a very poor nobleman, without his parents' knowledge. She has nothing besides honor and beauty, and thus is quite rich. Although I could, supported by our constitutions, prevent these youthful follies, I do not wish to impose greater unrest on my life, but I willingly commit these and other inconveniences to our Father. Because of the holy Zwinglianism, I would rather say the truth itself, I suffer more than some Lutherans; nothing would be desired in me, provided I swore to the words of some who are not even consistent with themselves. But He who wished me to grow old in my best purpose will preserve me in it to my last breath and beyond. I have resolved to speak much with the prince; if I accomplish anything, you will know.</p>
      <p>The assembly will bring aid against the Turk, I wish not for the Turk, with them. However, there is greater dissension among us than ever before.</p>
      <p>I do not expect an agreement between Margrave Albrecht and his adversaries, but rather a most unwarlike war, namely the destruction of the empire, at which we Swiss cows will finally rejoice with a bellow.</p>
      <p>Farewell and greet those to be greeted. January 2nd, 1557, whose beginning, progress, and end may be most fortunate for you and all good people.</p>
      <p>I wish to be informed about the successes of Lorenz Agricola. He alone has done more good in a short time than a thousand Saxons.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg Fr√∂lich (Laetus).</p>
