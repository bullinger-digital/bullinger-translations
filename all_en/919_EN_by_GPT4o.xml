      <p>Greetings. Clemens Lenerus, my relative, who delivers this letter to you, asked me to commend him to your kindness through my letter; which I have done more willingly, as he is cherished by me both in the name of his ancestors and especially in his own name. For he is a man endowed with many qualities and much faith by the Lord. He also has a son-in-law in Zürich and would desire nothing more than to find other sons-in-law for some of his daughters (whom he indeed has as very elegant), who would be lovers of virtue and domestic care, for whom he himself would not hesitate to provide a rather generous dowry. He has a wife from a great family, who is the sister of Jacob, your surgeon, a most reputable woman and a lover of Christian truth.</p>
      <p>Unless I am mistaken, he is entirely set on moving to the Zürich region one day, having once sold his very extensive estates, which he has possessed with great profit in the Toggenburg region and would continue to possess for longer, if he did not see that religion is clearly cooling among his people, which Antronius, the lord of that place, is undermining with remarkable cunning. I would like you to assist the man with your advice, should he request anything from you; for he is a good man, as I said, and suffers from no vice more than being sometimes more fond of wine than is proper. But this very thing has become so widespread in our age, that even in the highest ranks of virtue it is celebrated and those who excel others in drinking are praised. Farewell. From St. Gallen, the day before the calends of June, in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian (von Watt).</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the city of Zürich, my most esteemed lord.</p>
