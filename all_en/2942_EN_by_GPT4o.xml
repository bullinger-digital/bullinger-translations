      <p>My willing service and all good things beforehand. Gracious, beloved lord and brother, I have received your letter and understood its contents. I inform you hereby that I have kept Joachim with me in my house for reasons, as your son can inform you, primarily to honor you and for the sake of the family. The boy is childlike and needs not to be bullied or to be among other boys who might torment him. However, it is my desire that his family would provide him with a linen garment in addition to what he has, and by autumn, a woolen one in addition to what he has, or give me the authority to provide for him as needed at their expense. I am otherwise not inclined to incur costs beyond necessity; however, they might obtain the linen there better than the wool. I desire nothing more than that he be kept clean and proper in clothing. My dear wife is towards him as if he were her child; whenever he might improve the situation or not wish to stay with me, I will help him elsewhere; you may inform his family of this.</p>
      <p>I have spoken with Mr. Froschauer. He informed me that within 8 days he will start the work. I have insisted that your son bring you the exemplar for revision beforehand, and also show the Catalog of Myrica. There you will find various things about Heinrich IV and his times, and you may mark what you like, send some sheets to your son at the beginning and the others later. My advice would be to dedicate the work to the Count Palatine Otto Heinrich; it is not necessary to inform my lord. However, when the preface is made, we will then deliberate further. Otherwise, I am entirely pleased that it is published; for many beautiful things are included, indeed the whole history is beautiful and useful. I have told your son about the latest news from England, he can tell you. Where the expedition, intended for Werden, will sway, there are various opinions; I trust the matter very little. What these people do not do is solely because God does not allow them more at this time. May He keep us always in His protection. Greet your esteemed wife from me and my dear wife, and may God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, June 6, 1556.</p>
      <p>Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Stumpf, faithful pastor of the church in Stammheim, esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
