      <p>Greetings. I assume that the letters I sent to you, along with the writings of the most honorable consul regarding the Ganthner case, have been delivered. Now, what I have to add to those is this: Firstly, what we have received from France is included here. Then, on December 14th, the following was written from St. Gallen: 'On the given date, we received letters from Antwerp dated November 25th, and also from Augsburg on the 9th of this month, stating that the Spaniards have been defeated again, losing 8 ships with provisions, and some have been sunk. Also, the city of Romerswall has surrendered to the prince. The commanders Eberstein, Fronsperg, and Carli Fugger are demanding large sums of money from the Duke of Alba, which he does not have or is unwilling to give them; then 50 mules are expected from Italy to carry away his baggage. The new governor has not yet taken over the administration. It is believed that Middelburg is now in the hands of the prince.' I have transcribed this from the letters brought from St. Gallen.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord God that He grants you, your wife, and children a good and blessed year.</p>
      <p>I also wish the same to all our dear gentlemen who know you, Campello, the honorable mayors, both Pontisellas, Victor, Mr. Gregor, Bonetto, and other gentlemen and brothers. And if I write little or nothing in the next 14 days or 3 weeks, it is due to my business. God be with you eternally.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 18, 1573. Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Share this with our Lentulus and wish him a very happy year; inform him that Alexander Turacham, whom he recommended to me, has been imprisoned for his misdeeds. What has happened to him in Geneva, I do not know; Beza wrote to me seriously about this, advising us to beware of those who have once worn the cowl, etc.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, and faithful Mr. Tobias Egli, preacher in Chur, my lord and dear brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
