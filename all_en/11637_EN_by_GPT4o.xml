    <p xml:id="regest1">Good wishes for the New Year. Requests confirmation of the receipt of the dialogue [on polygamy by Johannes Lening] delivered by Quirinus [von Leiden] and the first part [of Bucer's Latin edition of the Regensburg Acts]; he has asked [Thomas Blarer] and [Georg] Vögeli to complete their poems [on Margaretha Blarer's death]; if they are not finished in time, [Christoph Froschauer] should print the excellent poem [by Rudolf Gwalther] alone. Regarding the plague, he regrets, like Bullinger, that the best are repeatedly taken away; in the penultimate week before Christmas, 25 people died of the plague, and in the last week, eight; towards the summer, there could be another increase in the epidemic. The excellent letter carrier [Johann] Leopold [Frey?], for whom Blarer unfortunately had little time, will be able to report further news; they have heard the same rumors about the emperor's death; if this is true, great turmoil will arise due to the various parties in the empire. [Johannes] Zwick was deathly ill but survived by the grace of God, who may continue to support his church. Greetings; [Johannes] Zwick also sends greetings and will write to [Konrad] Pellikan and Theodor [Bibliander] after a full recovery; they will send Bibliander's letter, thanking him for his sympathy on the death [of Margaretha Blarer], to Kaspar Schwenckfeld; further greetings. Together with Ulrich [Chelius], a French envoy came and reported that [Henry VIII] had captured his wife [Catherine Howard] and others and planned their execution.</p>

      <p>Greetings in our solid salvation in Christ, my venerable and dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>You wish for me and mine the joyful auspices of the coming year with such diligence and full prayers, I pray to the Lord with all my heart that they may return to you and yours doubled and even a thousandfold, so that you may receive with interest what you have sent.</p>
      <p>You mention that you have received my letters with the elegy, but you make no mention of the dialogue and the other booklet, part of which I arranged to be sent to you through that same Quirinus who delivered the letters to you, so I begin to doubt somewhat whether you have also received those. Therefore, in your next letters, you will free me from this concern. If the dialogue has been delivered, take care that it does not return to us without your judgment. I have urged my brother and Vögeli, as much as I could, to hasten the completion of the verses, so that everything may be published together, uncertain of what I have achieved. But if by chance we have not yet sent them through this excellent young man, there will be no reason for the printer to wait for them any longer, but rather to proceed with printing that one alone, since it will be sufficiently commendable and saleable not only because of the virtues of the most pious and excellent sister commended in it but also because of the singular artistry of the author and the truly noble and most delightful vein of writing.</p>
      <p>Regarding the pestilential disease there, I write nothing other than what you have already written to us once and again. This evil could be easily borne if you wish to estimate it by the number of those it takes; but among these, it often removes such a person whose life alone we would wish to redeem with the deaths of a hundred others, which indeed is either the sole or chief reason why we so greatly fear this hand of the Lord, perhaps seeing that unless He soon withdraws it, the ecclesiastical and civil matters will collapse once and for all in a very pitiable and irreparable fall. In the penultimate week, which preceded the Lord's birth, 25 died, and in the last week, no more than eight. If this evil, not deterred by this harsh cold, does not cease but continues to winter with us, there will be no small danger that, as spring approaches, gathering all its strength against us, it will rage excessively in the coming summer. The Lord, to whom we live and die, may do what is good in all His ways; to Him, we will entrust ourselves wholly and securely.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new here that would be worth your knowing, except for what this most holy young man will be able to narrate, whom indeed from the few words he responded to me in conversation, I could only judge to be of the best character and, besides learning, of a truly pious heart. Would that the Lord might support our failing hope for a better future generation with such a nursery of virtuous young men. It greatly pained me that, due to the injury of business, I was almost unable to offer any service to Leopold, which, however, although he is also most worthy in himself, I would have gladly done for your sake.</p>
      <p>Regarding the fortunes of the emperor, we receive nothing other than what you also hear there. Many firmly affirm that this majesty is extinguished, which if they truly affirm, will cause great disturbances for the entire empire due to the gaping divisions and party factions. May Christ our Lord soon transfer us to the tranquility of His kingdom, never to be disturbed again.</p>
      <p>Our Zwick almost gave up his spirit; recently struck by some disease, he was certainly near death. But God had mercy on him, and not only on him but also on me and His whole church, lest we have sorrow upon sorrow.</p>
      <p>He is indeed worthy of the longest life, who with indefatigable zeal and labor is wholly devoted to this, that all may not only live but live well and live for Christ alone, who died for all. You, with all yours, especially the ministers in the Lord, pray as much as you can to the Lord, that He may either avert the evil hanging over our heads or so mitigate it that we may be able to bear it without any loss to His glory and our souls.</p>
      <p>Commend me to all friends and brothers, especially to Pellican, Leo, Theodor, Megander, Gwalther, and others, by whose perpetual prayers we greatly desire to be helped before the Lord. Our Zwick orders his greetings to be added to all of you and commends himself most diligently to your pious prayers before the throne of grace; our German brothers do the same. He will write to Pellican and Theodor when his health is more confirmed; for he is still entirely languishing. We will take care to send the letters to Caspar Schwenckfeld, which our Theodor addressed to him, for which, on behalf of brother Thomas and myself, we ask you to give him the greatest thanks; for he very lovingly and Christianly expressed his sorrow over the death of our dearest sister in his letters to Zwick. May the Lord grant that all things may be prosperous and joyful for him, so that he may never have to grieve in turn for his own. Greet your wife in my name and that of my wife, along with your whole household and all your dearest ones. May Christ keep and bless us eternally, in whom farewell well and steadfastly, my venerable and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>In Constance, December 30, 1541. Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>The French envoy was here with Mr. Ulrich, the Strasbourg physician. Among other things, he affirmed that the King of England had thrown his wife, whom he recently married, into prison along with some of the principal men of his court and was planning the same against her as he had against his previous wives, so that this kingdom of his may never be without bloodshed.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and truly excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and brother, venerable and by far the dearest of all.</p>
