    <p xml:id="regest1">Haller takes the opportunity of Simler's journey to Zurich to write a letter. He praises Bullinger's commentary on the Epistle to the Hebrews and reports about Megander. Bullinger should oversee and expedite the printing of the records of the Anabaptist discussion in Zofingen, as well as ensure their dispatch to Bern. For his sermons on the Epistle to the Romans, he wishes for Bullinger's interpretation, hopes for his visit, and asks for news. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Although our Simler can certainly report everything you wish to know about the state of our affairs, dearest Heinrich, I did not want him to come to you empty-handed, so that you may have perpetual witnesses of my love for you.</p>
      <p>I have seen what you have published on the Epistle to the Hebrews, which has been almost entirely neglected by the scholars of our time. I am pleased with this endeavor and indeed with the completeness you have in sacred matters. I am pleased with the charity with which you seem willing to share the gifts given to you by the Lord with all your neighbors. I am pleased with the conciseness, which is most complete in aiming at the genuine meaning. May the Lord grant you life, leisure, and above all, the spirit, so that you may also benefit the Christian republic with other books of the Bible. May He also grant that you attribute what you have from the Lord to Him, so that you are not carried away by even the slightest mark of ambition. Eternal glory awaits you, which will illuminate you as worthy, by whose gift you accomplish these things, when you have pursued the glory of Him alone.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Megander has reported the best about all of you, which greatly delighted me. I hope for better things from the man day by day. But what he has done about his position, which he still holds with you, he has not yet communicated. He is poorly spoken of by some of our people, as if he had prepared both seats for himself. If you have anything with which the man may be excused, advise me.</p>
      <p>Therefore, let the records of Zofingen, as soon as they have been printed, come to us at the expense of the magistrates; for the dregs of the Anabaptists, most equipped for lying and deceiving, are increasing daily, and those who are easily moved by their tricks in the field cry out daily that this delay is the surest indication that the truth is on the side of the Anabaptists. Therefore, urge the printers, so that the printed works do not remain hidden for too long and we are not neglected. I would indeed wish that you had weighed everything with judgment, so that where there was an error, it might be corrected by another way.</p>
      <p>Finally, as I have often asked of you, if there is anything left that you have gathered on the Epistle to the Romans, share it. I deliver it for sermons, and although I have judgment, I am not so attached to myself that I do not greatly desire to hear your judgment above all. In the next sermon, a place on the accusing and excusing conscience on the day of the Lord is to be discussed. Although I may have completed it according to the measure of my spirit, I still hesitate in many things about conscience. I understand conscience as the law understood or the law of nature inscribed in our hearts and by these things judged and testified, which are good and which are evil. However, as to why conscience is broad for one and narrow for another, and by what causes it is erroneous, I could not absolutely provide, so I passed over it in silence, depending on you, so that as in all things, you may describe your judgment in this matter as well. Such an importunate friend you have gathered with your humanity.</p>
      <p>Lastly, I beseech you, always commend me to your prayers, and do not regret ever rendering service to me, who, without teachers instructing by living voice, have accomplished everything according to the good will of the Lord as best as I could. Oh, if only I could live to see the day when my flesh, that is, the affection I have for you according to spirit and flesh, would be refreshed by your presence. And if only you could come to me in the most secret manner, so that no one would know, until I had spoken to you to some satisfaction.</p>
      <p>Farewell, not the least part of my soul.</p>
      <p>Bern, September 8.</p>
      <p>I have absolutely nothing about public affairs. What Zuickius has done with you and what is said about the Turkish war with you, indicate even in a word.</p>
      <p>May your family be safe, Pellicanus, whom I wish to continue his work, which the brothers of our field, ignorant of languages, greatly desire, Leo, Carolstadius, whom I wish to be your companion - but let it be as you wish -, and all the others I wish not to be neglected by our greeting. Pray to the Lord for me.</p>
      <p>Your smallest coin, most devoted to any service.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his especially beloved brother.</p>
