      <p>To the honorable lord and father, I have no doubt that you are eager to know how our affairs are progressing here. So, in short, here is the situation:</p>
      <p>Our lords, the Confederates (the envoys), have worked earnestly in Davos to ensure that the Engadiners lay down their arms and that all matters are settled, to which the Engadiners have somewhat agreed.</p>
      <p>However, since the envoys were not given full authority, they promised to bring a final and, in their opinion, satisfactory response from the lords, the envoys of the 13 Cantons, to Chur on the 2nd day of this current month, which the lords, the envoys of the 13 Cantons, have been eagerly awaiting.</p>
      <p>And since no response had come by the 3rd of this month, they were displeased, as they would have liked to depart.</p>
      <p>I had also intended to give my lord, the mayor of Cham, a letter to you and have done so with this. As I was with the lords, the Confederates, on the evening of the 3rd of this month, and as many as the last guests with other lords marveled at the delay of the Engadiners, a distinguished man of this land accompanied me home, to my house, and as he bid me farewell at the door, he said: "Pastor, people are surprised at the delay of the response; but there is an old saying among the hunters: before the bear lies down in the den, he makes a move to avoid a trap (a danger).</p>
      <p>The Engadiners are still lacking one thing: they now see that they have been deceived and misled by the Salis; they will seek revenge on one or two of them." Thus he spoke in the evening.</p>
      <p>Behold, on the morning of the 4th of April, a messenger arrives, announcing that about 500 Engadiners had quietly gathered in a place called Sils (located in Upper Engadin, leading towards the Septimer and the Upper Bergell), had set out with great haste, and had descended through the Bergell so unexpectedly at night that the Bergellers (who are otherwise divided themselves) could not prepare any defense. They hurried to Claven, intending to capture the old Härtli and his son Rudolf (Härtli the elder was fortunately in Bergell at Sulg). They arrived in Claven an hour before daybreak and, as Claven had no gates, rushed to Härtli's house, surrounded it, broke in with force (though they found one door open, they forced open the other doors), searched the house from top to bottom, found Captain Rudolf, Härtli's son, tied his feet together under a horse, bound his hands to the saddle bow, and with great urgency took him to Valtellina, arriving in Travona that same night.</p>
      <p>The commissioner in Claven urged them to hand over the prisoner to him in the name of the Three Leagues, but it was not possible.</p>
      <p>The Engadiners would have returned home through Bergell much sooner, but feared the passes would be blocked against them (as initially happened), and they would be forced to give up the prisoner.</p>
      <p>They had no reason to fear any resistance from the Valtelliners as subjects. Now it is believed they have long used Rudolf as a hostage; for although the lords, the envoys of the Confederates, have written urgently and sent their envoys and complained about the violence, it is believed it is too late.</p>
      <p>You have the summary.</p>
      <p>Now there are differing judgments: among the Engadiners, it is considered an outrage and violence, especially since they promised the lords, the Confederates, not to act with force; others excuse the Engadiners, as these very Salis incited them to war and deceived them with many falsehoods.</p>
      <p>However, there are always at least 20 who wish ill upon the Salis, rather than one who has sympathy for them. The remaining Salis are in great worry; no one can yet know what will happen, and the matter is still unresolved. Friedrich von Salis has fled on foot; he defended his Engadiners in vain.</p>
      <p>They have let him suffer in a poor state. He was not Spanish, but they complain otherwise about him. [Time will reveal it.]</p>
      <p>Thus, this family has long been in great honor, having helped distribute all offices; now it begins to falter, and Antoni von Salis, the son of Augustin, who recently boasted of this city to their ruin, has come to Chur these days, calling for help. But the citizens, who have been in great worry for some time because of them, were so restless that he also had to leave the city. Thus, wherever the Salis implore for help, people secretly laugh at them.</p>
      <p>Thus, bad advice is the worst for the advisor. But whatever one may do, it is an outrage by the Engadiners.</p>
      <p>From Sils, where they set out, to Claven is 4 German miles; they covered it in one night. In Claven, they neither ate nor drank, nor did they rest.</p>
      <p>And as they descended and many rolled down the mountain at Casaccia, one falling over the other, not one said "ouch" or "woe," nor spoke a word, and what is remarkable: out of 500, not one was left behind, which shows what a hardy people they are. Joel 2: "They run like mighty men; none turns from his path; none pushes another; they do not covet gain." They took nothing in Claven but weapons and armor; for no nobleman far and wide is said to have a more splendid armory than Härtli; they say he has surpassed many counts. They broke open the chests, searched the letters, but took nothing else, as is still heard.</p>
      <p>You have the summary.</p>
      <p>The envoys have not yet returned. They are awaited at any moment.</p>
      <p>You expected a comedic outcome; but to some, it seems comedic, to others tragic. Certainly, those who were once most united and took up arms against us are now turning their weapons on themselves. But what will happen, I do not know. The Engadiners, who act with force, can neither be praised nor should they be, and before arms are laid down, it is difficult to predict anything certain about the outcome.</p>
      <p>May God improve it; for with us, it is lost. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, 9th of April.</p>
