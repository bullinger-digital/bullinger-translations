      <p>My friendly willing service beforehand, well-educated and honorable especially dear sir and brother-in-law, I have received both of your letters, the first dated the 6th day of June, the other the 4th day of November of the past 50th year, regarding my previous complaint about the ruinous commotion caused by the one who calls himself my son, which has brought me to a loss in body and goods, and I have understood all the contents. I express to you first of all my sincere thanks for your brotherly sympathy and faithful advice, as well as friendly comfort, contained in the first letter. I will also always be willing to be indebted to you and yours for such friendship and to deserve it. However, to inform you of the reasons why I have delayed my writing for so long, I let you know the following: After I, through my humble petition, have moved some noblemen and gentlemen from the cities to lay aside the envious, widely notorious poisonous affair, so that the dispute, in which my rebellious, wicked son has grown into a legal matter with the gentlemen of Rheinfelden, is undertaken for amicable hearing and settlement on both sides, as you can see from the enclosed copy, I intended to write to you as soon as the matter was brought to an end before the gentlemen of the government, but they have postponed it due to their unforeseen business until the middle of Lent and only then concluded it. During that time, I was afflicted with a severe illness from the old carnival until the week before Bartholomew's day. But although I have suffered effort and costs in obtaining the aforementioned agreement, I have gained little thanks with it. For despite the great displeasure that the aforementioned rebellious son has caused among the gentlemen of Rheinfelden, he has, within eight days after the agreed settlement, purchased a fisherman's house, located next to the town of Rheinfelden under the inn in the meadow and down by the Rhine, for up to nine hundred guilders, partly to be paid interest on, in which he has so far conducted his defiant behavior, which is very displeasing to my lords. Subsequently, he rode to the king in Vienna in great splendor under the pretense that he wanted to go to the Wildbad; what he achieved there is unknown to me, but it is well known that when he returned home on the feast of St. James, the steward of the lordship of Stein Rheinfelden had him arrested and taken to Rheinfelden to be imprisoned in the tower, where he lay for 5 days. What fear and commotion I suffered again in addition to my illness, any sensible person can easily imagine; but how the matter stood, I do not know.</p>
      <p>It would have been much more useful and better for him if he had maintained himself in foreign service for a few years, so that I would not have to sit in daily envy and suffer his consequences in all things; but my obligations concern him little. If he could completely ruin me and my children (as he has partly done), he would not spare himself, if he now had what I have and still possess, so that he could always carry out his plans better. And so I am drawn in like an unbaptized Jew; all my good deeds are forgotten by many. I sit in complete desolation, utterly comfortless in the world with my small household of six in heavy expensive housekeeping and loss, and must thus see my ruin because of him; for if such rejection and deprivation had not happened to me because of him, I would have left you and other people in my old age well untroubled. I have made inquiries in Basel with some who have responded to me just as you did in your letter. May Almighty God help and advise me and my children. I have much more to report to you, which cannot be written briefly, for which reason I have decided to come to you myself the next day. With that, you and my dear sister Anna, to whom I do not want to withhold friendly information about how things are with me, are always commended to God the Lord. Dated Rheinfelden on the 9th day of November in the year 1551.</p>
      <p>Johannes Adlischwyler, citizen of Rheinfelden. To the well-educated and honorable master Heinrich Bullinger, citizen and teacher in Zurich, my dear lord and brother-in-law.</p>
