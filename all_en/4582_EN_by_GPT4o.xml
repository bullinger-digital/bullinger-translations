      <p>Greetings. What I should write to you, reverend father, amidst such perplexed and disturbed affairs, I do not know. The matter of the bishop still remains unresolved.</p>
      <p>We would have won, if there were those who wished to make use of the victory; now, with our people hesitating, I do not yet clearly see the outcome of the matter. A meeting was to be held here; the people of Glarus had given cause for it.</p>
      <p>But the people of the Upper League are themselves holding separate meetings among themselves, and the matter of the people of Glarus, as it pertains to those people of the Upper League, seems to be in a precarious position. I feared this greatly before, and therefore every delay to me</p>
