      <p>Strasbourg, March 1, 1554.</p>
      <p>Greetings. At the end of February, I finally received the letters you sent to me on November 17; however, I felt no loss because of the delay. From the letters, I understand that you are well and safe, which is as delightful as anything could be. I pray to God that your health and well-being may be as joyful and enduring for you as they are for me. Certainly, I and everyone in our house are well. In addition to the lectures I usually attend, there are also the lectures of Dr. Peter Martyr, a man as excellent in doctrine as in piety, who has indeed been received among us into the order of the canons of St. Thomas. Besides Martyr's lectures on the Book of Judges and Aristotle's Ethics, we are expecting Dr. Zanchi's exposition on Aristotle's Physics. Dr. Peter Martyr is a friendly supporter of mine, promising that his assistance will never be lacking to me, and I must especially honor and cultivate him, which I strive to do with as much zeal as I can. But as you may already know: many good men from England have come to us, expelled for the gospel, partly from Cambridge and partly from Oxford, among whom I especially commend to you Dr. Thomas Lever, who is very eager for you, pious and of sincere religion, who, along with others, is compelled to visit a foreign land, having left behind his fortunes for the gospel.</p>
      <p>May the Lord our God finally restore England and the other afflicted churches to their full state. As I was leaving (my father), you did not cease to urge, that is, to instruct me to combine Greek with Latin here, now to make Latin from Greek, now Greek from Latin. When I do this, I certainly find the benefit not less than you said it would be; from this, indeed, comes a wealth of words, a variety of figures, ease of explanation, the ability to discover, and finally the imitation of the best, understanding is sharpened, judgment is acquired. Therefore, dear father, here you have some evidence of my diligence, namely a letter of Isocrates translated by me from Greek into Latin. Besides, there was nothing else to write. My fellow students greet you; our whole house wishes you well. Gabriel the tanner from Cologne greets you, who, if you wish to write anything to Dr. Johannes a Lasco in Frisia, will diligently take care of it; for he himself is going there within three weeks. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, your beloved son.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father. Zurich.</p>
