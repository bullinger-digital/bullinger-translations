      <p>Greetings. At the time I received your letters, most excellent man and my honorable brother, our Beza was in Germany with the most illustrious prince, the Count Palatine. He had set out to extinguish the Parisian fire, which has already consumed many and will soon erupt into greater flames. However, this evil is more serious, as the church has miserably dispersed with the brothers terrified by fear: very little hope is shown for its restoration, although in such great trepidation, twenty-two who were being dragged to execution were recently snatched from the hands of robbers near Orléans. But this will only fuel the dragon's fury.</p>
      <p>For in the elephant there is no force, except from its breath. The prince not only graciously promised what our Beza was asking for, but also ordered letters to be dictated, in a form he hoped would be most useful. And indeed, he has fulfilled his part.</p>
      <p>However, from his intercession, we infer how much relief the brothers will feel, because the dragon recently dared to provoke him deliberately. For he seized a fortress by force on the borders of Alsace, which was protected by his insignia.</p>
      <p>The condition of the brothers throughout all of France is miserable. Yet, as soon as a little time is given to breathe, they gather themselves again.</p>
      <p>Now I return to your letters.</p>
      <p>You suspect the assemblies, indeed you completely dislike them, which you think are not sincere nor for a right purpose, but are instituted with devious arts to adulterate the purity of doctrine. Yet I thought the integrity of the author, who is entirely ours, was known to you.</p>
      <p>And I wish you would judge more fairly about him and similar ones. Certainly, I am not yet led to believe that he is scheming anything cunningly or with courtly treachery: since he does not dissimulate that he supports sound doctrine even before judgment. Therefore, the pious zeal of this man moved me, whom I thought I would be injuring if I suspected anything sinister about him. What I am going to say about the whole matter does not aim to persuade you of what I see is so hateful to you, but to now confirm that I also have some reason for my counsel. As often as I have urged you not to refuse a colloquy, I did not hope it could be settled with everyone: for I have experienced not only how stubbornly they defend their errors, how fixed they are in their delusions, how arrogantly they despise all arguments: but also how much blindness and madness they are carried beyond all bounds of modesty and shame. But I professed that the outcome I wished for was almost certain to me, that many who are now silent would openly and frankly give their name to sound doctrine, others would become mild, and those who now seem most opposed would be broken. If this were to happen, it would not be a fruitless departure, because it would add not a little to us, that their resources and forces would be diminished. You object that the princes are held as if conquered by their own prejudice, because they want to stand by the Augsburg Confession.</p>
      <p>Believe me, in a just discussion, those magnificent boasts, with which we are attacked no less than with bombast, would cease. I was present, as you know, not only at friendly colloquies, but at declared contests. Approval of the confession was never demanded from me: but I obtained that Philip would expunge the word "really." Now indeed, why do they invite us to a colloquy, unless to resolve the controversy known to all by free and legitimate inquiry? But we will be burdened with greater envy if we refuse to subscribe.</p>
      <p>Indeed, all will rightly condemn our stubbornness if we refuse when called to a fair debate. That other scruple which troubles you should have been removed long ago.</p>
      <p>I confess indeed, care must be taken diligently, lest we be set against each other. But how shameful and disgraceful will the way of caution be if we do not dare to meet? To say nothing of other things, this distrust will open the door to not obscure dissensions among us, and expose us to the mockery of enemies. Nor do the examples you offer disturb me.</p>
      <p>The Lutherans clashed among themselves at Worms. Would you rather that all had cruelly vomited that Saxon anathema with the same madness? I wish indeed it had happened a hundred times already. If Philip had been endowed with the magnanimity that was fitting, from that departure the beginning of excellent concord would have arisen. But what is similar in us? For when Beza allowed a confession to be dictated by Philip, which would reconcile the princes of Germany to our French brothers, it could hardly have been done otherwise in troubled affairs. Certainly, we are too prodigal of innocent blood if the law you prescribe prevails among us.</p>
      <p>I did not articulate everything I should have said if I were asked for my opinion. But did he pretext anything alien to the right faith? Certainly, my softness does not endure, while the extreme dangers of my brothers are being consulted, to exercise such harsh and severe censures in the shade. But the same Beza published a confession in the common name of all, although no such mandate had been given. He denies that he abused our names, but privately expressed what he thought: then, since we were ill-reputed in those parts, for the sake of dispelling false infamy, he added what he had briefly included in a note was taught in our churches. But since it was an extemporaneous writing, and all knew that he had written down what he had discussed at the table the day before: whose equity is it to recall a worn-out tragedy so often? However, the accusation of bad faith inflicted a more serious wound of pain on me.</p>
      <p>You recently complained that in the laws of our school the word "substance" was placed by us, which by agreement was to have no use among us. What you promised I do not know: this has never slipped from me.</p>
      <p>But it was said by you without my objection! As if indeed other things were not inconsiderately thrown out, which I am reluctant to mention, since false reproach is bitter, then intolerable command to a free man. For I have not yet learned to speak servilely at another's nod, nor will I begin hereafter.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, lest you be unaware of what I will consistently defend if I am perhaps called to some assembly, I have tried to clearly explain the sum of my opinion, which I will change neither publicly nor privately. If I seem to have written irritably, consider how much occasion was given to me. For I prefer to bear you as a judge, than to quarrel with you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man and reverend brother.</p>
      <p>I pray much health to D. Peter Martyr, D. Gwalter, your family, and all your colleagues. May the Lord always be with you, guide you, and bless your labors.</p>
      <p>Now, with one leg crippled, I sit uselessly at home. All my colleagues greet you respectfully.</p>
      <p>Viret wonders why you have not responded to his letters. Farewell again, most distinguished man.</p>
      <p>Geneva, December 2, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, D. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich, brother and colleague most worthy of my respect.</p>
