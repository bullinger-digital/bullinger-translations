      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you, most esteemed lord and dearest brother, and grant you a most prosperous year, so that you may serve the Lord Jesus and His church in health and strength! You have not suspected in vain that some in Poland are nurturing a monster; for I am sending here to your piety the letters you see, and I beg you to return them as soon as possible along with your judgment.</p>
      <p>I believe similar letters have been written to Bern and Basel, from which I suspect similar ones have also been sent to you.</p>
      <p>I have seen those destined for Bern and Basel; however, since I have not seen yours, so that you are not unaware, I have sent ours and beg you, as much as I can, not to return them without your judgment.</p>
      <p>For a long time, there has been a rumor among us that there was a battle at Paris and that our side was victorious; however, since nothing certain is written to confirm that rumor, we begin to doubt with sorrow.</p>
      <p>I beg you, my lord and brother, to inform us through our Jonvill about the certain affairs of France; I know he is overwhelmed with other matters, but Jonvill will serve us in this matter, both for you and for us, whom you will greet in our name.</p>
      <p>Farewell. December 26, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Our Immontani and Palestini are now plotting something new against the Claronenses; for the wicked have no peace.</p>
      <p>Educate the third Pole, a man of integrity, well; this man can be of great benefit to the churches of Poland.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my venerable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
