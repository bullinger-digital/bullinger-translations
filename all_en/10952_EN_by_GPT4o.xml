    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for sending the opinions of Zurich and Bern on the [Wittenberg Concord] and reports on the decision of the Schaffhausen pastors, which has not yet been presented to the council: Since the Lutherans accept the [First Helvetic] Confession, they want to engage with the articles of concord if they are formulated less ambiguously and accompanied by the explanation of [Bucer and Capito], which should also be made clearer; however, they explicitly adhere to the doctrine of the exclusively spiritual partaking of the body of Christ and propose to have their own confession published. Vogt asks Bullinger to keep the pastors of Schaffhausen informed in the future. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>The judgment of the brothers of your church that you sent us, along with the decree of the Bernese, is welcome, and this for two reasons: First, because the church of Schaffhausen is no less a concern to you than the others, and second, because, aware of our weakness in this matter, you wished to consult with us. However, the meeting of our brothers had already been concluded, and it did not seem worthwhile to rescind our decree, since it does not differ at all from yours. We have not yet presented it to our senate. We hope, however, that nothing will be changed by them. Therefore, to make you more certain of what we have decreed, I have transcribed it here in order:</p>
      <p>"After the articles concerning the sacrament of the Lord's Supper reached us, were read and considered, we unanimously resolved, hoping also that you, our gracious lords, as members of the church to whom we have presented this in word, will agree. And namely, since we know that peace and unity in the church are exceedingly necessary and beneficial gifts, we, as far as it depends on us, do not wish to oppose them, especially since we have understood that Martin Luther's party is willing to accept our confession concluded at Basel. We also wish to come to their articles with such conditions that, firstly, the articles are made clearer and more extensive, so that everyone may clearly understand them without any suspicion of deceit, and also that they do not deviate from the explanation, which should also be made clearer, so that no one may think that we have in any way deviated from our confession in the Lord's Supper, namely that we confess the body and blood of Christ to be present in the Supper, but not otherwise than to the believing mind, and also that it is not received otherwise than spiritually, so that no occasion is given to the papists to cover up their gross error through such obscure articles. Then, if the articles are made clearer along with the explanation, we can well tolerate them alongside our Basel confession, which we desire to be published with the consent of the Swiss churches and not suppressed. And to prevent all suspicion of deceit, the articles may well be accepted with stipulated words" etc.</p>
      <p>The rest you have handled better and more clearly yourselves. Now it remains for me to earnestly ask you that, if anything of this kind happens in the future that is beneficial and necessary for us and our church, you would inform us of it out of your kindness.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name Bibliander, Pellican, Leo, and all the pious ones. My fellow ministers Heinrich Lingg and Sebastian Gr√ºbel greet you.</p>
      <p>Hastily, in Schaffhausen, November 7, 1536.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely,</p>
      <p>Simprecht Vogt, minister of the church of Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his dear lord and brother.</p>
