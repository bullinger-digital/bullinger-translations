    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger thanks for Blarer's letter [No. 2546] and is pleased about his recovery. He has forwarded Blarer's letter to [Hans] Schöner. He reprimanded the fabulating surgeon [Jakob Ruf]. Mayor [Hans Rudolf] Lavater was also annoyed with him, as he only allowed Ruf to leave for Konstanz under the pretext of [a necessary treatment for Blarer]. He was very worried about Blarer and immediately informed Bullinger of Ruf's [planned] departure.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Many good mercenaries will join [the Schmalkaldic League] not for the pay, but for the sake of the Gospel. If only they would finally attack! Otherwise, the costs will be horrendous!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The Dutch [troops under Maximilian von Egmont] have crossed the Rhine at Bingen. [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse will be beside himself! Blarer should report news about the Netherlands, Groningen, Mechelen, Bavaria, and Nuremberg. Is it true that Ingolstadt has been recaptured by the Emperor [Charles V.]?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Blarer will probably not have received [Bullinger's] letter from St. Gallen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Today [Itelhans] Thumysen departs [for the Diet] to Aarau.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger sends Blarer the excerpt of the letter addressed to the latter from [Georg] Frölich back. He will also write to him soon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Bullinger gifts Blarer his commentary on [Luke]. It was finished printing the evening before, but no copy has yet been assembled [from the sheets].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Greetings to [Thomas] Blarer, [Konrad Zwick], and [Jakob] Funcklin.</p>

      <p>S. D. I received your letter, brother incomparably beloved, and I give thanks to the Lord, who has restored you to us in good health. May He grant you perpetual health. I have given your letter to Schöner, a most excellent man. I reprimanded the fabulating surgeon. The mayor was angry with him, for he was dismissed under this pretext. Otherwise, Mayor Lavater would have retained him. Your adverse health also tormented him, and he was the first to inform me of his departure. But it is well, as long as you are healthy!</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Many respectable, honest, and wealthy people will join you, not for pay, but out of love for God's word, although some poor ones for pay. If only something would be done now! Almighty God, must it lie in such unspeakable costs for so long? Help, help!</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The Dutch are at Bingen over the Rhine. Consider how it goes with Hesse! May God improve it! I trust Him well. If you have any news from the Netherlands, from Groningen and Mechelen, let me know, or if you have anything from Bavaria, write. Oh, it concerns me and others very badly, how and what! How is it with Nuremberg? It is said that Ingolstadt has been recaptured by the Emperor. Let us pray to the Lord incessantly! He alone will deliver us.</p>
