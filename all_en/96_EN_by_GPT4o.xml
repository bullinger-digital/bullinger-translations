    <p xml:id="regest1">Schuler has in recent days not received Bullinger's letter regarding Pastor Lorenz Meyer's departure from Schwanden and has taken note of it. However, the procedure regarding Meyer's change of position surprised and angered him, especially because Meyer had only been sent to Schwanden the year before by the Mayor of Zurich and the Zurich Council at the request of the Glarus Landammann Dionys Bussi and the Glarus Council.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">In Schwanden, he was well received by the entire church community, provided with an appropriate salary, and, to Schuler's knowledge, never treated poorly or insultingly. Schuler would have expected Bullinger or the Zurich Council not to allow Pastor Meyer to leave Schwanden unless he could present a significant reason for it. And even if he could, he should not have left his position without first hearing the opinion of the people of Glarus, and then a corresponding negotiation should have taken place.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Meyer considers (as does Bullinger!) his completely unfounded departure from Schwanden to be a divine calling; Schuler does not want to judge that. He himself rather considered Meyer's calling to Schwanden to be legitimate, which was approved by Bullinger, the Zurich Council, and the pastoral colleagues in Schwanden. But now this calling seems to be a mistake, and Meyer's appointment in Brugg a completely legitimate calling...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">If only Bullinger knew what difficulties this would cause the Glarus church both in the Glarus Council and throughout the region, especially since the Zwinglian party has long been accused of their pastors being as greedy as the mass priests and only eager for the most lucrative benefices, the stateliest parsonages, and a service not exposed to the danger of persecution. What can the Zwinglian party still counter to such accusations, which have already been confirmed in this case?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">If only the people of Glarus had had pastors from the beginning of the Reformation who were fully committed to the Zwinglian cause! Where would the Glarus church stand today? Apart from Meyer and previously Valentin Boltz, no other pastor has left his parish (even in danger of life and limb!) unless he was expelled by the local authority or had to resign due to illness. And yet the people of Glarus now, in this dangerous end time, urgently need reliable and well-trained pastors. For only a quick-witted pastor could defeat the devil, who now shows himself and rises.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Schuler regrets Meyer's departure, especially since he is learned, while in the Glarus region many preachers are already quite old and also not sufficiently trained. Schuler is also annoyed that Hartmann von Hallwyl, who initiated the appointment to Brugg, was given preference, while the church in Schwanden was left empty-handed. Meyer's services were so well attended that additional seats had to be set up for the many people who came to his sermon. Moreover, often even at the last bell ringing before the sermon, several (even old believers!) from other churches would come running. Therefore, Schuler hoped for much good from Meyer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Is it now supposed to be a divine calling just because someone who serves under difficult conditions is offered a more pleasant position? Ultimately, it is about people everywhere, and everyone should be careful to fulfill their calling. As long as God calls a person to a pleasant and beautiful place, he proves willing. But if He commands him to give up what pleases him most, even to sacrifice his children or himself, he should behave as bravely as Abraham [instead of fleeing from his calling]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Schuler writes this not because the church community in Schwanden or he himself wants to hold back Meyer, who wants to leave, but so that Bullinger realizes that the people of Schwanden are not blinded by his nice (not to say: glossing over) words.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">As soon as Schuler has a little more time, he will elaborate on his view in more detail. Bullinger should take the concern collegially (as it is meant!) and show the church of Schwanden that they can count on his support. If Schuler had decided to present his concern in a personal conversation with Bullinger, he would not have been able to stop talking. But in a letter, he must hold back...</p>

      <p>Revered, dear sir and brother, I offer you my willing service along with all due respect. I have recently received a letter from you concerning Pastor Lorenz, our preacher, and have understood it. I have received not less astonishment than displeasure from it, especially for the following reasons: Namely, firstly, because our lords, the bailiff and council, wrote so amicably to a mayor and council in Zurich, to be involved in this matter, and to persuade the aforementioned Pastor Lorenz to come to us in Schwanden, which was done at their request.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>As he now fares well with his lords, he was unanimously accepted by us, the church members, and provided with an honorable salary. I cannot understand that he encountered any disgrace, dishonor, or inappropriate treatment with us. I would have thought that if he did not present important, indeed honest reasons for his departure to you or an honorable council, it should not have been allowed or permitted by you or the authorities. However, if he had such a sufficient complaint against us, that he had a rightful and justified reason for his preconceived opinion, it should have been required from him or you, if we were aware of it, and then handled accordingly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>But that you and also Herr Lorenz consider this departure (without cause!) a divine calling, I cannot judge; let it stand in its worth. God knows. I considered the previous calling, since it was approved by an orderly authority and also by you and the church servants, as a rightful and Christian calling. So perhaps that was a delusion and the subsequent one entirely certain and infallible.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Would to God that you knew what offense is growing in our church, indeed before my lords and the entire region because of this. And especially it is already present, as our adversaries have sometimes reproached us, that our preachers are as greedy as the mass priests: Where they know the best benefices and the most splendid positions, and expect little cross and persecution, there they settle. Now the matter will first begin against us. What can we then answer as the convicted in this case?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Oh God, should we have had preachers on our side at the beginning of the Gospel who risked their lives with us. Where would we have come to? This Herr Lorenz and Valentin Boltz alone have been so without need and cross, but the others have persisted in all danger to their lives and limbs, until they were expelled by the authorities or had to resign due to illness. Now we are still in this last, dangerous time, urgently in need of faithful, pious, and learned preachers. For now the adversary raises his head properly and would need a quick-witted warrior who knows and can overcome with advantage.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>One more thing grieves me: That in our land some preachers are already quite old and unfortunately not all learned, that they would be very necessary for a man like Herr Lorenz now is. And yet it must be that the one from Hallwyl has the advantage in this matter and the church in Schwanden stands empty, which is truly to be pitied. For since Herr Lorenz has served the church, it has been filled with people so that they had to be expanded with chairs or stands, and when the last bell for the sermon was rung, many (also some who are still of the papal faith) ran from other churches, so I hoped he would have accomplished much good.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>And yet, if now someone does not have everything he desires in our rough lands, God has called him to another place where he has it better! In God's name, we are human. Let everyone see to it that he fulfills his calling. As long as God calls us to good, peaceful, fruitful, and pleasant places, we are willing. But when He commands us to sacrifice our greatest joy and own children, indeed ourselves, let us see that we go to the task bravely with good Abraham!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>I do not write this because the church in Schwanden or I personally wish to further desire this Herr Lorenz, since we feel his will, but so that you hear and understand that we are not blinded by good (I almost said: with glittering) words or made blind with open eyes.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Soon after, I will report my opinion to you better. I have not had much time this time. I ask you to notice it with good brotherly intention from me (as it truly happened) and always show how our church in Schwanden relies on you for all good. For if I could speak with you in person, I might not be able to come to words enough about this matter. I remain silent through writing. Dated Schwanden, Wednesday before St. George's Day, in the year, etc., 48.</p>
      <p>Your willing brother Paulus Schuler, in Schwanden in Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the revered, well-learned Herr Heinrich Bullinger, preacher, Zurich, my especially dear lord and friend.</p>
