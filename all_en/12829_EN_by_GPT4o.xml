    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] As it emerges from Haller's letter [No. 2769] dated January 25, Bullinger's letters have not arrived, but in the meantime, Haller should have at least received the letter delivered by his relative [Konrad Kambli] [dated January 22; not received]. Bullinger has communicated his [advice requested by Haller] in a timely manner: It is important to hold out in Augsburg as long as Haller's conscience allows and as long as one can stand up for [the Gospel]. But of course, Haller and his three colleagues [Lorenz Meyer, Thoman Ruman, and Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder] should not deliver themselves to death, especially since Christ and Paul have fled from their enemies several times. However, if Haller were to fall into the hands of the enemy, he should, according to Matthew 10, [28], not fear those who can kill only the body but not the soul.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Yesterday, Haller's letter [No. 2759 dated January 19] arrived. Bullinger has forwarded the letter addressed to the Zurich mayors Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab [dated January 18] to them. They promised their help and immediately consulted regarding their response to Haller, to the [three] other Zurich pastors in Augsburg, and to the council of Augsburg. They sat together until ten o'clock. Bullinger does not yet know their decision. However, he hopes that they will allow Haller and his colleagues to return to Zurich if the Gospel can no longer be preached in Augsburg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In the meantime, the Zurich pastors in Augsburg should bravely persevere in remembrance of the suffering of the prophets, apostles, and Christ. Blessing wish.</p>

      <p>I received your letter written on January 25, from which I understand that you have not received my letters, although I do not doubt that you have by now at least received mine from your relative. I wrote my advice to you in a timely manner. I advise you to stay as long as you can with a clear conscience, as long as you can promote the kingdom of Christ. Here, here love and zeal for the Lord's flock are demonstrated. However, since Christ the Lord himself and the divine Paul very often avoided the fury of their enemies by fleeing, I would not want you and the other three brothers to throw yourselves into the flames. But if by divine disposition it happens that you fall into the hands of the enemies, call upon the Lord, be strong, and remember the truth of the saying pronounced by the Lord: "Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul," etc. You know the teaching of our Savior in Matthew 10.</p>

      <p>I received yours yesterday and made sure they were delivered to the mayors. They promised all their efforts and went straight into a council to consult on what could be answered to you, the brothers, and the city of Augsburg. They sat diligently until the 10th hour. Now, what they have decided, I cannot know for sure. However, I hope that a proper decision has been made for you and the brothers and that a return is open if it is no longer pleasing to freely preach the word of truth.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>In the meantime, be strong in the Lord. Think about what the prophets and apostles have suffered, and our Lord himself, and persevere in the confession of the truth until the end. May the Lord Jesus keep you and the others.</p>
