      <p>Greetings, my venerable and excellent Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I recently returned to Konstanz, that is, on August 26, with the good grace of the Duke of W端rttemberg, except that he paid me less generously than was fair; for I suffered a loss of almost 300 gold coins during the entire four years, in which I was overwhelmed and utterly exhausted by the unbearable labors in his domain. And yet I thank my God that, having been released from there with a good conscience, I am now restored to my own. However, I wanted to inform you of this in a few words, although I am very busy, so that I know what rumors my friends might spread, namely that I was sent away by an angry prince, so that you have something to counter them with; for whatever the prince did wrong here, he did it not out of anger, but out of habit. For that is his way. However, I hope that someday, through some favorable opportunity, he will kindly compensate what I now desire and exercise a generosity worthy of a prince, since he is otherwise not ill-disposed towards me.</p>
      <p>Commend me to the most illustrious men Pellican, Leo, Theodor, and the other brothers and friends, whose prayers, along with yours, I earnestly wish to be aided by before Christ. The people of Z端rich greet you, along with my brother and sister. Farewell, my more than dearest and best brother.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, the last day of August, 1538.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Church of Z端rich, my lord and most esteemed brother, etc.</p>
