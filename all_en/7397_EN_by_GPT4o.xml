      <p>I do not doubt, most esteemed man, that you have recently received my letters, to which I add these present ones and (I confess) I trouble you too much. The wedding has been completed; your people and your women are returning home, and as far as I have seen, they have conducted themselves most modestly. There were some among us who thought that dances should be led in honor of the Swiss; but the better part prevailed, so that it did not happen, especially since the people of Zurich did not request it and opposed it during these most dangerous times. Are public dances allowed among you at this time, I ask you to write; for some objected to Mr. Pontisella, as he was doing his utmost to prevent this frivolity. I recently refrained from writing this: Our Mercury has spread everywhere and filled the ears of our people that the Prince of Cond√© does not pay his soldiers in good faith, but uses lead instead of silver and thus deceives the poor. He also distributed a certain writing these days, which if I can obtain before the departure of the wedding guests, I will send.</p>
      <p>Today, everyone is invited by the bishop. Farewell in these matters. A certain citizen of Chur, who served as a forerunner in the war, recently returned and said that peace negotiations are being conducted on both sides and nothing else is expected except a delegation sent to Spain, to see if the king will deign to consent to peace. As soon as it arrives in France, either peace or battle will follow. - The bishop's cause (as I hear from reliable sources) is not yet in port, but is navigating dangerously. The communities of the House of God are breathing threats and slaughter.</p>
      <p>Some even in our neighboring city have decided that certain people should free themselves from episcopal taxes and not care about the composition of the nine men. The House of God will indeed hold this Swiss composition valid. In the meantime, however, they will extort and demand anew all expenses made from the bishop; if he agrees, it will be well; if not, nothing else but turmoil and treachery is to be expected. He will undoubtedly call the Swiss for help; but this will be too late for him. Far more atrocious disturbances are feared than ever before. May the Lord restrain the factious and grant us His peace. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell again. Mr. Consul, Mr. Pontisella, Gantner, Gar... and all good men greet you.</p>
      <p>Chur, swiftly, February 27, 1568.</p>
      <p>Some have asked me to take the prophet Daniel to be explained to the church; but I know what suits my shoulders and what the times are like now. If you would advise this, my father, I would eagerly wish for your memorials on this prophet to be described by a good young man, whom you would choose among you. Farewell 3. Your reverence's most observant Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his eternally revered lord and father. Zurich.</p>
