      <p>Greetings. While I wait for messengers through whom I might write to you, the things I intended to write become old and outdated. This has happened to me several times now.</p>
      <p>I recently wrote through this same person, who had decided to return here from Neuchâtel; but, while I was waiting for him, he went straight to Zürich, leaving the letters here. Now I hope he will receive these upon his return.</p>
      <p>In truth, I have little new to report now.</p>
      <p>Yesterday we finally heard that the castle of Héricourt was captured by the Württembergers.</p>
      <p>Now, if any more secret plans have been hidden, they will be revealed. There is no need to write about what happened in Basel, since you will have already learned this from your envoy, Mr. Tumisius.</p>
      <p>It is now awaited whether the prince will accept the decision made there; our people neither expect him to do this nor would they want him to; for in this way, they seem to retain more rights and favor over the entire dominion. The Duke of Longueville, to whom the county of Neuchâtel belongs, is expected here; for he has matters to discuss with our people regarding that county. We hear that he is well-disposed towards religion and brings a minister with him.</p>
      <p>The Waldensians are said to want to negotiate with the prince again after so many successes; he gives them good words, but it would be surprising if he does not deceive them. In France, matters are uncertain; Vendôme is of no value; yet the churches flourish and grow. In Lyon, it is reported that during the recent Feast of Corpus Christi, while a solemn procession was being held, someone snatched the consecrated host along with the monstrance, as they call it, from the priest, threw it to the ground, and trampled it underfoot; he himself was first deprived of his right hand on the same day and then cut into four parts.</p>
      <p>We have nothing else from France now.</p>
      <p>We have also written to the Rhaetians and encouraged them towards peace; we do not know what errors may be hidden; however, they seem to be excessive in exercising that discipline; for most of the questions that Angelus proposed depend on that matter. Our French also continually engage us on this matter.</p>
      <p>We do not resist the discipline itself, which we wish were established in the best way possible! But we seem to foresee that it will cause no less disturbances to the churches than it did in the past, as both the writings of the fathers and ecclesiastical histories testify. You are not unaware of what is happening in Basel and Strasbourg; therefore, there is no need for me to write anything about these. We wonder what the outcome of the Chur synod was; if you have anything, share it with us.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Diesbach is in Baden; Emanuel is departing for Lugano today.</p>
      <p>Zehender was going to send something to you; but they will send it through another person, who will follow this one in the coming days. However, Samuel, my and your relative, sends these to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Give my regards to your entire household in my name and in the name of all of mine.</p>
      <p>May all the brothers and fellow ministers also be well. Bern, June 18, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your forever, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
