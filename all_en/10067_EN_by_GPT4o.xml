      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You ask of me, dearest Berchtold, something which I have never considered more diligently myself; namely, the degrees of kinship and affinity according to Moses, which, as you also admit, are entangled with convoluted calculations, and I have always touched upon them lightly. For I am accustomed to withdraw more willingly from those things that turn the mind up and down and even around, especially if no necessity urges me. Although, to tell the truth, I do have my own calculation here, but indeed a simple one, which I will gladly show, not so much to teach you as to learn from you; for I will share ours with you on the condition that you in turn propose yours, for I bring them forth to be weighed.</p>
      <p>Thus, these persons are specifically listed in Leviticus 18 [6ff], who seem to exclude a certain crowd of people from marriage. First are the parents, father and mother, followed by the stepmother. From her is the sister, whether born in a legitimate or illegitimate bed, whether born of the father only or the mother. Then follows the grandson along with the granddaughter, that is, the daughter of the son and the daughter of the daughter, and then the full sister, whom the Hebrew calls the daughter of the father's wife [Lev 18,11]. Following her are the aunt and the maternal aunt, that is, the father's and mother's sister, likewise the uncle, that is, the father's brother, along with his wife, also the daughter-in-law and the brother-in-law, and finally the stepdaughter along with her children, to whom is joined the sister-in-law, that is, the husband's sister; in total, if I am not mistaken, 15 persons.</p>
      <p>But there is no doubt that more are also included, which opposing members infallibly explain to us, since the same reasoning and judgment apply, as you also write, in similar cases. For if it is not permitted to marry a stepmother, certainly it is not permitted to marry a stepfather; if a brother is barred from the embrace of a sister, whether she is a full sister or born of only one parent or a stepsister, undoubtedly a sister is not permitted to marry a brother. Thus, neither should marriages of grandchildren be joined to us, for a grandson is properly the son of our son, and a granddaughter is the daughter of our daughter. Hence, we call (according to the opinion of Emperor Justinian, Institutes of Imperial Law, Book 1, Title on Marriages) the aunt the sister of our father, the uncle the brother, and the maternal aunt the sister of the mother. Therefore, by similar reasoning, the uncle, that is, the mother's brother along with his wife, is numbered among the prohibited persons; for the uncle's wife is also prohibited, but the same degree and reasoning apply to the father and mother, therefore the uncle along with his wife are among the prohibited. Again, it follows by the same reasoning that the husbands of the aunt and maternal aunt are prohibited, unless the reasoning for brother and sister is different; for if one should not join with the uncle's wife, why should a girl be joined with the aunt's husband? Likewise, the daughter-in-law is the wife of my son, and if I cannot marry her, then the son-in-law and father-in-law and mother-in-law are prohibited persons. The son-in-law is the husband of my daughter, the father-in-law is the father of the wife, and the mother-in-law is the mother of the wife. Now if the father does not join with his daughter-in-law, why should the son-in-law be admitted to the embrace of the mother-in-law? And the sister-in-law is the husband's sister; opposed to her is the brother-in-law, the husband's brother. Here, therefore, is also John the Baptist: "It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife" [Mk 6,18]. Therefore, both the brother-in-law and the sister-in-law are contained under the same yoke. But perhaps these things are more obscure; therefore, I now present the summary of matters and thus more than 30 persons as if on a tablet for contemplation, and that for the use of our language, so that all may be clearer and more certain:</p>
      <p>To the unmarried young man, these persons are notably forbidden to marry: the mother, the mother's sister, the father's sister, the father's brother's wife, the mother's brother's wife, the stepmother, the full sister from father and mother, the sister from the father alone, legitimate or illegitimate, that is, the stepsister.</p>
      <p>Thus, to the unmarried daughter, these persons are forbidden to marry: the father, the mother's brother, the father's brother, the father's sister's husband, the mother's sister's husband, the stepfather, the full brother from father and mother, the brother from the father alone or mother alone, legitimate or illegitimate, that is, the stepbrother.</p>
      <p>Likewise, the wife's sister and the husband's brother or brother's wife and sister's husband are also forbidden.</p>
      <p>Thus, to the man, the following persons are forbidden: the son's daughter, the daughter's daughter, the stepdaughter, the stepdaughter's child or children, the son's wife, and the mother-in-law. Conversely, to the woman, the following are forbidden: the son's son, the daughter's son, the stepson, the stepson's child or sons, the daughter's husband, and the father-in-law.</p>
      <p>We have arranged these things in this way for the sake of teaching and clarity, not because I think these degrees apply only to the free and not also to the man. Therefore, what I have separated, I have separated for the sake of ease, nor did I think it necessary to cut to the quick and precisely separate the degrees of consanguinity from affinity. For who does not know that those related by marriage are joined not by blood, but by the bond of marriage? Henceforth, anyone will easily see what should be referred to under the title of affinity and what under the title of kinship, and this is our, my dear Berchtold, small and humble judgment on the degrees of affinity and kinship, where in the meantime I know you expected something far different. But since it is not possible to present to you what we wish, come, accept what we can, and consider these things of ours favorably.</p>
      <p>As for excommunication, about which you recently asked what I thought, I see excommunication as nothing other than the public and Christian guardianship of public decency and Christian morals, for the Most High alone judges hearts. For Simon Magus, whom Philip had received into the church by baptism, Peter did not reject until he revealed his impious mind with impious signs. Likewise, neither Ananias nor Sapphira nor Demas nor other pseudo-Christians were excluded before the time. And the apostle Paul says: "Some men's sins are open beforehand, going before to judgment; and some they follow after" [1 Tim 5, 24 f]; for I believe no one thinks otherwise than that public and offensive crimes should be punished by excommunication, where brotherly admonition avails nothing, or where such a crime is designated that it cannot be passed over with impunity, lest it become a bad example. There are indeed great indications of this in 1 Corinthians chapter 5 [1 ff]. This seems to be the first thing to be examined, with whom the authority of excommunication lies and what its mode is.</p>
      <p>I know indeed that many of the Anabaptists are miserably tumultuous in this matter, because the power of punishing crimes and the guardianship of decency (for that is what I understand by the name of excommunication) is committed to the magistrate. For they immediately thunder with a certain horror: "If he will not hear you," says Christ, "tell it to the church" [Mt 18,17], and the magistrate is not the church. Nor do they see that Christ used a synecdoche three or four times. But if they deny it, we will wait for them to convene the church, to which they will present their complaints against the obstinate. But they say he speaks of a particular church. Therefore, we have won, for Christ evidently used a synecdoche, so now they cling in vain to the letter that kills; what follows immediately in the same words of the Lord? "Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them" [Mt 18,20]. Therefore, if Christ committed excommunication to a particular church (as they also admit) and two or three, likewise twelve and twenty-four, make up a particular church, what prevents Christ from also committing the authority of excommunication to the magistrate, if he is gathered in the name of Christ? For why do we labor so much that the magistrate is chosen and gathered only from Christians, unless so that the guardianship of public decency can be safely committed to his care? For he is also the minister of God, according to the apostle [Rom 13,4 and elsewhere], namely, to plant, promote, and protect what is decent, beautiful, honest, and holy, and to remove the contrary.</p>
      <p>What, that the authority of excommunication will be more complete and greater with the magistrate than with the mixed populace, which, as it lacks judgment, is often led by emotions? Nor indeed are we all Christians, who in the meantime are counted in the church of Christ and bear votes. What then will you do among those who are held by the same disease that you wish to be extinguished? If therefore you now seek the exclusion or punishment of him who has sinned, he will fear lest he be strangled by the same noose that he would tie for them, and so he will cleverly dissimulate and call for mercy, or, having stirred up a tumult, he will dissolve the assembly and the church with the matter unresolved. For we see daily where our affairs fall, if one or another is dragged out, so that, having laid aside his former life, he may live better, and it has been certainly observed by all ages that the best things have always been undertaken by the smallest part of the people, and among the few and select, honesty has flourished. For what if one or another of the magistrates degenerates or acts with deceitful plans? Let him be deposed from his position and a more sincere one be appointed in his place, which cannot be done in the mixed populace. This is relevant, for in Exodus 12 [3] we read that the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron: "Speak to the whole congregation of the children of Israel"; and shortly after, when he writes that this command of the Lord was fulfilled: "Moses called", he says, "all the elders of the children of Israel" [12, 21]. From which it is clearly evident that the church is not impiously usurped for a certain crowd of people; from all of which it follows that the authority of excommunication is not transferred to the holy senate by robbery (as some say), but piously. Indeed, the very ancient and most learned Tertullian supports these things of ours, who in the "Apology" against the nations, chapter 39, speaking of Christian discipline, says: "We gather together to recall the divine scriptures, if the quality of the present times compels us to forewarn or recognize anything. Certainly, we feed our faith with holy words, we raise our hope, we fix our confidence, we also strengthen the discipline of precepts with repeated inculcations. There also are exhortations, chastisements, and divine censure. For judgment is made with great weight, as among those who are certain of the sight of God, and the highest pre-judgment of the future judgment is, if anyone has so sinned that he is relegated from the communion of prayer and assembly and all holy commerce. Approved elders preside, having obtained this honor not by price, but by testimony. For no matter of God is established by price" etc. By these words of Tertullian, it is clearly evident that the authority of excommunication at that time, that is, in the primitive church, was with certain men distinguished by life, morals, and piety, not with the mixed crowd of the church.</p>
      <p>But thus, you say, the papists have prevailed; for they affirm that the statutes of their councils are the statutes of the church. "For where two or three are gathered" [Mt 18,20], there is the church. But three hundred and four hundred bishops often gathered, therefore they were the church of God. Now "if anyone will not hear the church, let him be to you", says the Lord, "as a heathen and a publican" [Mt 18,17]. But they are mistaken, for to be silent now, not every assembly is holy, nor does our church, which Christ mentions in Matthew [18,20], gather to establish sanctions against the scriptures; for the true church of God hears and recognizes only the voice of the shepherd. Christ clearly declared: "if they gather in my name" [Mt 18,20]; but they gathered "in their own name" (as Christ says in John 5 [43]), therefore they did not gather in the name of Christ.</p>
      <p>We testify in this matter to the decrees of the popes. But that the bishop took for himself alone the authority of excommunication, and exercised and claimed his tyranny with it, is more shameless than what deserves a response. But these things by the way.</p>
      <p>It remains to discuss the mode of excommunication, although I do not see what could be brought forth more copiously or beautifully after Christ; for he, having placed certain steps: "If", he says, "your brother sins against you" [Mt 18,15] and what follows, for the place is otherwise known, which teaches that after brotherly admonitions have been in vain inculcated, exclusion should be inflicted, so that, I say, he may suffer the punishment of crime and contempt, who had despised brotherly admonitions. But Christ (they say) "if", he says, "he will not hear you, let him be to you as a heathen and a publican" [Mt 18,17] and Paul says "let him be delivered to Satan" [1 Cor 5,5], he does not say: let him be delivered to the magistrate for punishment. To which we respond that Christ indeed wanted nothing else by all these things than that he should be publicly punished, who, having despised friendly admonitions, continued to live dishonorably. For to be a heathen and a publican is to be counted and held among the criminals, to whom you dare not safely commit anything of duty or sincerity; as we are accustomed to publicly disgrace adulterers, drunkards, and others openly flagitious, stripped of honor and robe; moreover, what is this but a public punishment? Thus we also admit that Paul wrote "let him be delivered to Satan", but he also added: "for the destruction of the flesh" [1 Cor 5,5]; from which it necessarily follows that not only Christ himself, but also the apostle was not speaking of some internal perdition of the soul, but of some external rite and therefore also an external punishment. For in 2 Corinthians chapter 2 [6]: "Sufficient", he says, "is this punishment for such a one", that is, punishment or correction; for "to honor and to be honored", according to Budaeus, "is said for what is to punish and to take action against someone", and punishment is the estimation of punishment and the mode of action. Again, "to rebuke", according to the same author, "means to reprehend" and to be rebuked is to conduct a census and estimate. "Dishonored are also said to be marked with infamy" and who "as if overthrown in all fortunes", as it is with Demosthenes, "could not retain civil rights". "Therefore, it was lawful to kill the dishonored with impunity, as those deprived of the protection of laws"; "similar to those whom the ancient Latins called intestable, as Horace: 'let him be intestable and sacred'" and "Caius the jurist: 'When by law', he says, 'someone is ordered to be intestable, it pertains to not receiving his testimony'" etc. Briefly, we now see Paul using punishment for dishonor, that is, punishment, and he wants this alone to suffice. Therefore, let the punishment set and paid by the magistrate - that is, the church - suffice for our criminals according to the measure of the crime.</p>
      <p>And let this be our mode of excommunication, namely, that at the beginning the sinner is admonished by a familiar friend, then by one or two others, so that he may see the matter is serious. If he despises these, let him be called and brought before the church, that is, the magistrate and those in charge of excommunication, and if he neglects these as well, let him pay the penalty. And let this be, according to the word of the Lord, the mode and end of excommunication: the punishment, I say, imposed and paid, so that nothing is excessive, as Paul also thinks. But they seem to want too much, who command that the magistrate punish the crime and that it be punished nonetheless by the leaders of excommunication with the prohibition of the supper. Therefore, those who now think that excommunication cannot be anywhere, where sinners are not barred from the sacred synaxis, seem to be more severe and less observant of what the nature of excommunication and what the nature of the Eucharist is. For excommunication is for the sake of a bad example, lest it spread further with impunity, therefore after it has been punished and restrained, it has fulfilled its function, nor is it spread more widely. But the Eucharist is for sinners; now if they are excluded and only the pure are admitted, for whom, I pray, was the blood of Christ shed? Was it not shed for sins? If therefore the sinner is barred, who in the meantime is not obstinate, Jesus shed his blood in vain. "For those who are well do not need a physician" [Mt 9,12]. What, that the Eucharist itself is joined with consolation, for the free remission of sins is announced. But excommunication has more terror, for sins are punished not indeed for purification or satisfaction, so that it may be safe to recline at the Lord's table afterward, but to repel a bad example. Therefore, one should be separated from the other, so that each may preserve its genuine nature. We consider this to be satisfied, after the criminal has been publicly punished and, as it were, confounded before the church. After the penalty has been inflicted and the manumission, we think the synaxis should be free for him and left to the discretion of anyone's faith, whether he wishes to approach or abstain. Nor indeed should it be turned into punishment and affliction for the wretched, what Christ instituted for consolation and healing.</p>
      <p>But why, they ask, should the profane be admitted? But indeed he has paid the penalties of profanation, now he stands by the judgment of God, not ours, for he has satisfied ours. But do you, O man, who thus judge another's servant [Rom 14,4], also wish to judge his faith? Do you not know that faith is not the merit of satisfaction, but the gift of God? [Eph 2,8]. And what the Lord teaches: "If your brother sins against you, rebuke him, and if he repents, forgive him. And if he sins against you seven times in a day, and seven times in a day turns to you saying 'I repent', you shall forgive him" [Lk 17,3f]. What, I pray, are the intervals, or how many years, I beseech you, did the Savior set for Matthew, Magdalene, Zacchaeus - as we have elsewhere disputed against the Anabaptists - and what else is the Eucharist but the public assembly of believers? For those who believe they are washed by the blood of Christ and wish to give thanks to the liberator approach. Who then will prohibit even him from the synaxis, who, having now been punished for the committed crime, desires to participate at the Lord's table, for he trusts in Christ and gives thanks? Or indeed does no one trust in Christ unless he has first done penance for several weeks? Where then is the preaching of the gospel now, where now is the prodigal son, the interpreter of the thief on the cross, but also that publican compared to the Pharisee, indeed and preferred, finally Zacchaeus, Magdalene, and Matthew? Therefore, excommunication should not be mixed with the Eucharist, nor indeed should he be barred from the sacred table, who has not yet been convicted or even convicted and punished of public crime, indeed treason, contempt, obstinacy, and pertinacity (although he otherwise does not wish to be a guest at this supper). For excommunication was a punishment for him, but the Eucharist stands free for him afterward through faith. Almost the same before us was written by the man of supreme judgment and purest religion, Zwingli, in "Friendly Exegesis to Martin Luther" page 150: "Hence also we brothers in Zurich" etc.</p>
      <p>But what others (lest that perhaps be left unmentioned) object to the word excommunication, as if that excommunication and correction of crimes cannot be said, which does not also bar from the sacred synaxis: for excommunication is said, they say, as deprivation of communion, that is, of the Lord's supper, which certainly cannot be with you, who are content with the punishment of the magistrate. What, I say, they bring forth, they bring forth in vain. For the word excommunication was in use among the ancients, which in the meantime you hardly find in the sacred writings. Therefore, as you first taught in Bern, they lived among those who censured no public crimes, while in the meantime no one was allowed to punish them, as among those who had no power of the sword. Therefore, another way had to be tried, since this was denied success, by which public decency would nonetheless be consulted. Therefore, the public prohibition of the Eucharist and prayer seemed to them to be the most convenient way, which would lead to public decency and by which deadly contagious sins would be exported from the holy assembly of the faithful. Therefore, they called their excommunication that repelling of crimes and preservation of public decency.</p>
      <p>For nowhere did the Lord himself teach that crimes should be punished and abolished by the prohibition of the supper, who did not exclude even Judas from the supper; for although Hilary excludes the traitor, the evangelists do not exclude, but assert that Christ reclined with the twelve, and John most openly: "And supper being ended", he says, "when the devil had already" etc. [John 13,2]. Augustine agrees with us. Therefore, although he most earnestly warned Judas, he did not exclude him from the supper; indeed, it is certain that even the apostles of the Lord did not use the breaking of bread in this way. For Paul in Corinthians: "As often as you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes" [1 Cor 11,26]. By these words, he does not segregate any kind of people, but proposes the cross of the Lord to all equally, so that they may trust in his death and give thanks. Therefore, he left the feast of the supper free and wanted it to be. For he much more clearly adds: "Now if anyone eats this precious or peculiar bread unworthily", for the Greek can very emphatically: "this bread", "and drinks from the cup of the Lord", here he calls it "the cup of the Lord", not "this cup"; "this" therefore in the former member he placed emphatically, "unworthily, he will be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord", "of the Lord" with the article, so that we understand the body and blood, not indeed of transubstantiated bread and wine, but of that Lord who hung on the cross; for it has the nature of relation to another. "But let a man examine himself, and so let him eat of the bread and drink of the cup" [1 Cor 11,27f]. Behold, you have the clearest opinion of the apostle that the Eucharist is not one that can be prohibited or even offered to anyone at anyone's whim, but which is left to the discretion and examination of anyone. For what could be objected from chapter 10: "You cannot partake of the Lord's table and the table of demons" [1 Cor 10,21], does not fight against ours, but is of another institution and status, as you yourself know. But these things so far.</p>
      <p>But you, my dear Berchtold, before we depart from here, consider for me in passing, what finally this use of the Eucharist and that mode of excommunication of the ancients, that is, the mixture of synaxis and epitimeseos, has brought us. For from there sprang up for us the blasphemous satisfaction, various rites and stations in churches or temples set for penitents according to intervals of time, and all that theatrical hypocrisy, about which if you wish for more copious things, you will find in Rufinus "Ecclesiastical History" book 10, chapter 6, and again in Sozomen in Epiphanius "Tripartite History" book 9, chapter 36. If therefore we too have made the joyful assembly a certain mournful nerve of correction, it is to be feared lest the most joyful fruit of the Eucharist, joy and rejoicing, degenerate into some papal torment and that penitential satisfaction returns by right of postliminy, indeed and trust in works, as we see it happened among the ancients, who nevertheless undoubtedly did not begin with that mind and counsel, to which it finally receded. In the meantime, we prejudge no one, dearest Berchtold, and we especially want this to be testified to you; for having been taught better things, I will most gladly yield. For this is my opinion on excommunication, which, as you requested, I have now fully set forth, partly to gratify you, partly so that you may also write back what you think; for we are now expecting yours.</p>
      <p>Farewell and greet our Gaspar Megander, Francis, and Rhellicanus, and also Heinrich Simler in our name.</p>
      <p>Bremgarten, July 6, 1531.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger, as you are mine.</p>
