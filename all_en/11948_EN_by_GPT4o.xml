    <p xml:id="regest1">Could not follow the invitation from Bullinger, [Konrad] Pellikan, and [Georg] Binder to perform his "Susanna" six years and four months ago, as the letter arrived only on the day of the performance. Sends a new work ["Judith"], which might be performed by the youth of Zurich; has no objection to it being printed by Christoph [Froschauer] and therefore sends a thoroughly corrected, printed copy of it. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Six years and four months have already passed, most learned man, since I received a letter from you inviting me to Zurich for the performance of our "Susanna." This letter was written partly in your name, partly in the name of Master Konrad Pellikan, my most esteemed teacher, and Georg Binder, your schoolmaster. This was very pleasing to me, yet it was impossible for me to come to Zurich to see the performance, as the play was being performed on the very day I received your letter.</p>
      <p>Behold, I send you another drama which, in my judgment, is not unsuitable for this time, should your youth also wish to perform it. I send you only one copy, as it is no less well-corrected than the previous one, although I have diligently overseen the printing myself. If you wish to entrust this, as the previous one, to the press of Christoph Froschauer, I will not object; for this very reason, I send you a copy marked with corrections. I ask your kindness to consider it favorably.</p>
      <p>Greet Master Konrad Pellikan and also Georg Binder in my name, and furthermore, those with whom I have had no familiarity so far, not even through writing, such as Bibliander, Calvin, Gwalter, and other pious and learned men of your community, whose names I honor and revere even in absence and ignorance.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>From Augsburg, 7 days before the calends of May.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your lordship, Xystus Betuleius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed master. In Zurich.</p>
