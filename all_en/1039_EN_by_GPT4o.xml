      <p>Greetings. Because I was expecting at every moment what news Augsburg would bring, I delayed responding to your previous letters longer than was fair. Now, what has been written to me, I send to you transcribed.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is entirely focused on ensuring that the so-called House of Austria has a hereditary succession to the governance of the Roman Empire, which I will indeed be very surprised if he obtains from the estates, especially since he is trying by all means to impose not his brother Ferdinand, but his son Philip, even against his brother's will. Regarding that Brunswick disaster, apart from what is commonly rumored, I have received nothing certain from anyone, and I think some error has crept in for some reason, as if they made two sieges out of one. Indeed, a month and a half or a little more has passed since the Brunswick siege had to be lifted due to the very certain thunderbolts of the cannons from the city, and then, when they pursued those fleeing, whether they were citizens or garrison soldiers in the city, they inflicted not a slight loss... and the enemies made a loss of life. Whether Brunswick attempted anything a second time after this, I am not at all certain, just as I am not about the Emperor's fleet and the damage received in Africa. What these frequent signs in the sky portend for us, as there is hardly anyone who can predict with certainty before the event, so I think everyone does not doubt at all that they signify the most severe scourges of the Lord impending on our Germany, which, however, will be mitigated by the favorable omen of the rainbow often intermingled with them.</p>
      <p>Let us therefore fear not these signs in the sky, but the Lord of the heavens himself, and let us turn to him with serious and timely repentance, lest after so many and such great warnings of the best Father being despised, we seem to knowingly and prudently cast ourselves into certain destruction. Indeed, more atrocious things threaten our heads than the common Christians understand; he who comes with twenty thousand is indeed moving his camp against us, with whom when we cannot contend on equal terms, let us send to him embassies of sacred prayers and the fruits of solid repentance, humbly asking for those things which are of peace, lest with accursed confidence we engage with him and disgracefully succumb and perish eternally by our own merit and fault. Pray for us, my friend, that we may escape all these things by the timely assertion of our most gracious and merciful Savior Jesus Christ into his heavenly kingdom. In which even now and forever, farewell. Winterthur, October 2, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>May your household be well with all brothers and friends.</p>
      <p>I return the letter of Sch... for which I thank you for sending. I also send the letters of Johannes Ulm, which were given on the day before the calends of May, and I received them on the third day before the calends of October, that is, four days ago. Since they contain some matters pertaining to you, I wanted you to read them; having read them, I ask you to return them.</p>
      <p>To his venerable and dearest Bullinger.</p>
