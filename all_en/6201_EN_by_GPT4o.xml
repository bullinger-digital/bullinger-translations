      <p>Greetings. In the recent letters, which I sent to Birwyl, I wrote about what has been done in our Savoyard matter up to the 18th day of this month. On that day, the senate met again in full along with the deacons, and the whole business was carefully considered and discussed. Finally, the decision prevailed that if the Duke of Savoy wishes to accept the terms of the Treaty of Nyon, ours will also accept the same.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we await his response, which he must give here by the 25th day of this month. Ours will respond in Chambéry on the same day.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the Genevans are complaining loudly and claiming they have been betrayed, although provision for peace has also been made for them. But because not everything is done according to their will and prescription, nor can it be, they curse us and ours. May the Lord grant that everything finally comes to a good end!</p>
      <p>The King has left Lyon due to the plague raging there. They say he is now in Dauphiné, not far from Valence, in a place called Crémieu. They also say that the Queen of Navarre has left the court, along with all the loyal princes. The rumor about the city of Abbeville being occupied by the admiral was, as I hear, unfounded.</p>
      <p>In Lyon, after the king's departure, the gospel is again publicly taught, and the churches are restored.</p>
      <p>We have not yet heard anything about those German soldiers who have gone to Italy, as to where they are heading; if you have any certain information about them, please inform us.</p>
      <p>In Holland and Lower Germany, we hear of serious uprisings arising, and the matter is not far from sedition and civil war.</p>
      <p>However, I think you have more certain information about these things.</p>
      <p>The plague is also beginning to rage in our fields below Solothurn.</p>
      <p>We hear that Sultzer in Basel is also suffering from it, but we do not yet know how he is doing. Last night, Mr. Peter Cyro, the old chief scribe of our city, a learned and upright man, died of apoplexy. I have nothing else to write now, except to commend you to the Lord; may He keep you safe for us and the church for a long time.</p>
      <p>All your friends and brothers greet you, both consuls, Mülinen, Diesbach, Grafenried, my father-in-law, Zehender, etc., and finally my mother and wife.</p>
      <p>Greet all yours in our name.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 22, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, lord and compatriot, always to be honored by me with the highest respect.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
