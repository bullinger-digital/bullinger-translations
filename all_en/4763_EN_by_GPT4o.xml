      <p> Greetings. Indeed, your letters, reverend father in Christ, are all delivered to us; but I have absolutely nothing with which to repay you in return, nor have I been able to ascertain anything certain from others so far. Mr. Consul denies, and other merchants deny, that they have anything worth knowing, unless perhaps you are eager to know this, which, however, most who come to us from there affirm for certain: that the Pope has thrown himself into the greatest difficulties and indeed, since he removed Duke Palliano and Caraffa, he has never been at peace, so much so that he seems to have stirred up hornets and aroused incredible hatred from many against himself. </p>
      <p> It is said that this concern has so wearied him that he has been bedridden for 14 days and has almost wasted away from anxiety. Therefore, whereas he was previously content with one taster (credentzer), it is now said that he employs three at the table. So the devil also has his martyrs. </p>
      <p> This is all I have and nothing more. </p>
      <p> Farewell, most illustrious man, with all your family, as happily and for as long as possible. </p>
      <p> Chur, April 21, in the year of our Lord 1561. </p>
      <p> Your most observant Johannes Fabricius. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant leader of the Church of Zurich, his most revered lord and patron. </p>
