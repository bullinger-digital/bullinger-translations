    <p xml:id="regest1">Until now, the admonition and formal reprimand among the brothers [pastors] against this procedure have been expressed; that now, despite long patience, the matter must be brought before the [other] congregations for decision-making, [the people of Neuenburg] regret; they send [a description] of their previous approach and have also allowed the opponent to present his view [see below in No. 2023]. The fathers and brothers [of the other congregations] now have the task of expressing their judgment in this regard, in order to maintain the previous custom, if it is correct; [the pastors of Neuenburg] would wish to see an example from the opponents to learn from it, instead of being deprived of those things whose loss would cause great harm. The censorship is exercised as follows: The one to be reviewed must withdraw; the dean then asks the neighbors if they are aware of any violation by this brother [pastor] against the church or the pastoral service by him or his family; then the others are asked what admonition they consider appropriate; thereafter, the brother [pastor] is called back and kindly admonished, according to the decision of the brothers [pastors], to perform his service piously and to contribute to the building of the church. [Variant to the previous paragraph:] The admonition and formal reprimand are handled as follows: The one to be admonished must withdraw; then the dean inquires with the neighbors and relatives if they are aware of any violation by this brother [pastor] against the church or the pastoral service by him or his family; then the others are asked what admonition they consider appropriate; thereafter, the brother [pastor] is called back and, by the counsel and judgment of all, kindly admonished to perform his service piously and to contribute to the building of the church.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Until now, the brothers have engaged in mutual admonition and fraternal correction, not without great benefit, so that each one might more fully perform his duty, and purer doctrine and uncorrupted morals might have a place in our church, and the way might be closed to contrary things. However, unexpectedly, someone has arisen who condemns the entire action. Although it was long expected (as it often happens that people's opinions change over time, especially where one person opposes everyone, and there are many others who try to win over that one), nothing has yet been achieved by this means. Although this pains us greatly, it is somewhat comforting that the judgment has been referred to the holy churches. Relying on the fairness of the cause, we thought it best to simply present the reasoning of this action to the pious brothers, which, as we believe, we have followed so far neither against the word of the Lord nor against charity. In what was objected to us, we gave the opposing party the freedom to present what seemed right to him on the contrary side. Therefore, he wrote some things with his own hand, from which, if they are approved by the churches, as he hopes, he persuades himself that this custom of ours of correcting will be overturned.</p>
      <p>Therefore, fathers and brothers, it will be your task, as much as you strive for the glory of the Lord, to make a holy judgment on this matter: so that this custom of ours, if you judge it holy and pious, may be preserved. We would wish to see some example from those who cause us trouble, and to learn better things from it: not to be deprived of those things without which we cannot be without great loss. Farewell and help us with your prayers. Neuenburg, October 28, 1544.</p>
      <p>The censorship is conducted as follows: The one to be reviewed is ordered to withdraw. Once he has withdrawn, the Dean asks the neighboring reviewers what they know about the brother that openly offends the church, where the building of the church is hindered and the pastor's ministry is despised, both because of him and because of his own? Finally, it is generally asked of others what they think is worthy of which the brother should be admonished? Once everyone has cast their vote, the brother is called, and according to the conclusions reached by the brothers, he is candidly and kindly admonished to perform his duty piously and to build up the church.</p>
