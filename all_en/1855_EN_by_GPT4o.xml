      <p>I recently received the most delightful letter you sent me through the students from Z端rich, most illustrious Bullinger. In it, I understood that you greatly desire Funccius's Chronicle, newly printed in Prussia; however, the reason you do not receive it with this message is that only a single copy was brought to me by my relative Oporinus, purchased for three florins in Frankfurt; for it is a work printed in large folio, though not very accurately. Nevertheless, I will ensure, if it can be done in any way, that this necessary book, so greatly desired by the most learned men here and there, will be printed by us in quarto at the next Frankfurt fair, so that it can be purchased by anyone at a much lower price. The books, which I had arranged to be called for in your name through Peter Mechling from Strasbourg many months ago, I have not yet been able to obtain due to some negligence of the man, who now offers this excuse, now another, to justify the delay, although I pay for everything with ready money. Furthermore, I have requested your letters to Myconius of blessed memory six times from the heir Jacob, who indeed did not refuse, but has given nothing so far; however, as he is now preparing to depart for France, he has solemnly promised to send the bundle to me before he leaves. I hear nothing new except that the Margrave of Brandenburg, with a thousand horsemen, successfully clashed with eight banners of the Bishop of W端rzburg and took many noble captives, the news of which I do not doubt has already reached you. Ferdinand is imposing new and very heavy taxes on his subjects through Alsace to resist the Turkish threat. If you have anything about preaching the gospel again in Constance, I am eager to understand it in your next letters. Farewell. Basel, April 28, the day the Floralia are celebrated in Rome. Brisecislaus, the eighteenth king of the Bohemians, and Baldus, the renowned jurist of Pavia, have passed away. In the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Lycosthenes.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious pastor of the church of Z端rich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, incomparable lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Z端rich.</p>
