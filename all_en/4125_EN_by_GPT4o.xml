      <p>Greetings. Indeed, I have nothing now to add to those things which I wrote recently.</p>
      <p>We hear that the Prince of Savoy has set out for Nice and that his wife has followed him; what he is planning is not yet certain. We know that our neighbors are preparing arms and are in a state of suspense; but I hope that the Lord will confound them. I do not know what your messenger has brought, whether a diet will be announced or not.</p>
      <p>I have a relative in Lucerne, Captain Herbort, who was here these days; but we could not ascertain anything certain from him. What is happening in Glarus, there is no need for me to write to you; I fear that those churches will eventually collapse unless the Lord miraculously sustains them; for no one cares about this matter, and they themselves bring upon themselves all these evils. Meanwhile, we have received nothing from Geneva, except that they are diligently building new fortifications and preparing for a siege. Meanwhile, new disputes are continually sown between them and our people.</p>
      <p>We must pray to the Lord to reconcile our minds in these great dangers, lest that unending discord eventually be the ruin of both parties.</p>
      <p>We have nothing certain about the Scottish expedition nor about the death of King Philip. We have a lamentable story translated from Spanish into German about 14 noble and famous persons who were strangled and burned with great pomp in the presence of princes and the whole assembly of Spain, which I suppose you also have; I do not have it at hand now, otherwise I would send you a copy. I return to you the letters of Fabritius and give thanks.</p>
      <p>May the Romans remain forever without a pope. Musculus has already handed over his works to the printer and... they are now under the press. He was urged too much; otherwise, he intended to share them with you first.</p>
      <p>He greets you in return, and so do all the others to whom you ordered greetings to be sent, especially Mr. Diesbach, whose wife, a most honorable matron, recently passed away to the great sorrow not only of him but of the whole city. My mother, father-in-law, and all friends greet you and yours.</p>
      <p>May all yours be safe, as well as the brothers and fellow ministers, my most esteemed lords. Bern, 16th of November, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his lord and ever-honored compatriot.</p>
