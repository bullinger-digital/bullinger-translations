      <p>S. D. I have received all the letters you sent to me; I thank you for all of them.</p>
      <p>I believe you have received those which I sent back through Anton Burkhard, our fellow citizen, as you requested. The incident with the broken barrel quite alarmed me; for I feared that it might have caused your mother-in-law greater harm than you had written; but I am glad she is now feeling better. I would have sent those letters, which I have now written about, sooner; but they did not seem to contain anything special. You will learn more fully what is happening with us, if you wish, from Mr. Herter, the courier.</p>
      <p>Some Papists, a kind of people, as you know, hostile to us, have somewhat disturbed our pleasant gathering. As far as I can gather, those Baden baths, as they call them, do not entirely agree with my constitution; I can hardly tolerate the heat. I have nothing more to write now, except that, when the next synod is held, you excuse me for not appearing in person. I suppose you have heard about the diet held in Schwyz.</p>
      <p>The people of Schwyz, who bathe with us, have revealed everything to us. There has never been greater dissension among them; it was celebrated with great and insane outcries from both parties; the same is predicted to happen among the people of Zug on the next Sunday. Mr. Hartmann von Hallwil has not yet come to us; we await his arrival daily.</p>
      <p>I commend my family to you, which I am sure is commended to you even without my speaking. Please greet my mother-in-law, relatives, and my Margaret for me.</p>
      <p>Given at Baden, April 29.</p>
      <p>Your son, Ludwig Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest father.</p>
      <p>Day in Schwyz, April 3, 1559</p>
