      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Our Joachim Furer, who has just delivered this letter of ours to your kindness, requested a testimonial from us. However, not concerning the account of his life spent with us for some time, for which, unless we are mistaken, he recently obtained an ample testimonial from our council, although we would not have failed him in this matter either, if it had seemed necessary. But we wish to testify how rightly and diligently he has played his part in our literary study for a year and a half or perhaps somewhat longer. Since he so anxiously requested that we gratify him here, he obtained it from us very easily and without any effort, especially since we understood that you also wished the same. It was also added that he is entirely convinced that this will be of some use to him either with you or with others. Therefore, we truly testify in good conscience that he is a pious and learned man, who diligently presided over our literary school, as we have found, and not without great benefit to the boys, leaving nothing untried in shaping their minds and cultivating both their morals and their letters. Although we have never heard him teaching in the school, we have nevertheless been able to ascertain this by some sound conjectures, and the matter itself loudly proclaims the truth of what we affirm about him. Therefore, if anyone recommends him to someone or if he himself expends any service and goodwill towards him, you should not think it placed in an unworthy person, nor ever doubt that he will beautifully and in all respects respond to any friendly recommendation, unless our judgment completely deceives us, which, alas, happens to many others in judging, no matter how wise they may seem to themselves. Therefore, it was not rashly said by Horace, to whom you recommend, look again and again. But the integrity of this man has been so explored by us through many arguments even from boyhood, that we do not hesitate to commend him to you; if you embrace and promote him, you will be doing something not unworthy and most pleasing to both of us.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your most honorable wife and sweetest children, as long as possible in good health.</p>
      <p>15th of May, in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>Matthias Hirsgarter, Bishop of the Church of Winterthur, Heinrich Lutius, fellow priest, your servants.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in both piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief of the sacred sermons of the people of ZÃ¼rich, his dearest and most esteemed friend.</p>
