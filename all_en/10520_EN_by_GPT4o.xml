    <p xml:id="regest1">Because Bucer is urging a meeting of South German and Swiss pastors to promote concord, the previously reluctant people of Konstanz now invite Bullinger, Leo [Jud], Ambrosius [Blarer], and Pellikan to Konstanz on December 15. In case of prevention, Zwick requests to send the [new] Basel Communion Declaration. He demands his letter about the Arians [No. 425] back, as it is no longer useful to Bullinger after the publication of the "Assertion of Both Natures in Christ".</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>The messenger we sent to Augsburg to Bucer has returned. From the letters he brought, we understand how anxiously the excellent man strives for concord, believing that such opportunities now present themselves as never before. He had planned to convene several ministers of the churches from both Swabia and Switzerland. But we resisted for many reasons, which I have written to him about. Now, in his later letters, he repeatedly asks in the Lord that, if it can be done in any way, you and Leo [Jud] would be willing to come to us on the 15th of this December. For Bucer himself will also be present with some from Swabia. Finally, we are calling Ambrosius [Blarer] with our own messenger, hoping he will also be present. If only Pellikan would join you as a companion, do not cease to urge him in my name. But if you cannot be present on the appointed 15th day for any reason, then by all means ensure that we have that confession, which you recently mentioned to me, subscribed by the people of Basel. Bucer desires nothing more than your presence with Leo and Pellikan. To ensure you know this plan in time, I wanted to send this personal messenger. Satan attempts cruel things under the title of this sacrament. If only we could meet truth with charity, especially through prayer to God.</p>
      <p>I would like you to return the letters I wrote to you about the thoughts of the Arian sect. Since you published the booklet "Assertion of Both Natures in Christ," they can be of no use to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and do not disappoint our hope.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, December 9.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and pious man, Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of Zurich, my lord and esteemed brother.</p>
