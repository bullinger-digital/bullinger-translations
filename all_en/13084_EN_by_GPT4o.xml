    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Myconius received on October 2nd the letter from Bullinger [No. 3020] sent via Hartmann von Hallwyl from the hands of the Homburg bailiff [Martin Hagenbach].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The propositions of Emperor Charles V [for the Augsburg Diet] displease Myconius. This shows how excessively ambitious the Emperor is and how much he hates the good. No wonder: He is not interested in knowledge and scholarship; moreover, he neglects God, even though he often has His name on his lips. The Swiss Confederates will soon be in trouble if God does not protect them!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Allegedly, Maximilian of Egmont, Count of Buren, is advancing with a new army from the Netherlands. Duke Henry of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel is said to have been expelled again by the Brunswickers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Gospel is thriving among the English. Therefore, God blesses them, even in foreign policy. It seems that King Henry II of France will not declare war on them and that the Scots will accept the peace offered to them by the English. This is assured.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Insiders are increasingly claiming that King Ferdinand will be the next Pope, and that the Emperor is impatient because he wants to leave Augsburg as soon as possible to move to Strasbourg, or against the Swiss Confederates, or even to Italy, and not for the sake of religion, but to become ruler over all of Europe!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] When Duke Christoph of Württemberg, Count George of Württemberg-Mömpelgard, Hans von Heideck, and other nobles, together with an Augsburg accountant [...] and the two Basel chief guild masters [Marx Heidelin and Blasius Schölli] were sitting at the table and discussing various matters, the Augsburg man said: "Now the victorious Emperor will attack you, our neighboring Swiss!" One of the chief guild masters replied: "What do you say about the Swiss? How strange that they occupy you so much! But let it be said to you that if the Emperor attacks them, he will soon have to learn that they are still vigorous and will not behave like the [German Protestants]! Should he win (God forbid!), he would still have to suffer heavy losses!" Thereupon silence fell over the whole table until someone introduced a new topic. So not all Baselers are fearful!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Meanwhile, Ludwig, the son of the Zurich mayor Hans Rudolf Lavater, also arrived in Basel. Myconius told him what he knows about Paris, including the plague rampant there, which, if it continues, would certainly lead to an interruption of classes. This was reported last week by some students returning from France. Ludwig was not impressed by this and claimed never to have feared the plague: He wanted to leave as soon as he found a travel companion.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] In the meantime, Myconius has read Bullinger's letter [No. 3032] with the enclosed writings [No. 3023 and No. 3017]. The news in letter [No. 3023] about the Emperor's hunt is amusing. What is written there about the [Dutch, intended for the Emperor] riders fits with what Myconius wrote above about the Count of Buren. The news in the letter from Johannes Haller [No. 3017] about the forced participation of the [Protestant] princes in the Catholic mass displeased Myconius, just as it did Haller; and like the latter, he cannot trust the Emperor, for he hears the mass, tolerates the bishops, lets his soldiers rage unpunished, especially against the Gospel. Count George learned from Augsburg that there the priests bribe the poorer citizens to attend the mass. When they came to a shoemaker and gave him a thaler, he promised to go to mass for 14 days. But when he came home, he suddenly died!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Johannes Gast asserts that he entrusted the edition of the satires of Persius to a bearded man named Michael [Martin Stella] (a printer or typesetter).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Philipp Melanchthon is in Wittenberg, where he wants to stay if the university reopens. Otherwise, he will follow the advice of good people and move away from there. He wrote this [to Bucer].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Greetings to Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, and all colleagues. Bullinger knows that one must pray. In the present misery, even the good lose God's spirit because they fear so much for their lives, their wives, and their children. May the Lord provide comfort!</p>

      <p>On October 2nd, I received what you sent through Hartmann von Hallwyl. The Homburg bailiff delivered it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The propositions from the Emperor displease me, as they indicate his nature: excessively ambitious beyond words, and a hater of all that is good and just! This is evident: He does not love letters or scholars, neglects God, even though he often names Him. Unless the Lord protects us, we will soon see astonishing things against us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>There is a rumor about the Count of Buren coming from the Netherlands with new cavalry. However, I have nothing but rumors. About Heinrich, it is said again that he was expelled by the Brunswickers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>In England (thanks to the Lord), the cause of Christ is making great progress, and God blesses them even in external matters, so that neither the French bring war upon them, and the Scots seem to be about to accept the peace desired by the English. This is true.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Those knowledgeable about affairs now more openly whisper that the papacy is to be transferred to Ferdinand. The Emperor is said to be hurrying in all things, to leave Augsburg as soon as possible, either to Strasbourg, against us, or to Italy, not for the sake of religion, but to become the lord of Europe.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Here at the table sat together Duke Christoph, Count George, Heideck, and other noble men, as well as an Augsburg accountant and two tribunes of our city. Among many things they discussed, the Augsburg man said: "Now the victorious Emperor will attack you Swiss neighbors!" Here one of the tribunes replied: "What do you say about the Swiss? They concern you strangely! Now let me tell you: If the Emperor comes, we will, with God's help, go against him in such a way that he and his must realize that we are still alive! And even if he should win (God forbid), we will make such a hole in his ranks that he will regret it as much as we do! We will not act, if God wills, as you and your kind have acted!" After these words, silence fell over the whole table until someone finally introduced a new topic. This is to show you that not all of us are children of fear.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Meanwhile, the son of the consul Lavater arrived. I told him what I certainly know from Paris, among other things about the plague raging there. If it continues as it has begun, it will disrupt the school. This was reported by students coming from France last week. However, whatever I said to Lavater about the plague, he strongly dismissed, asserting he never feared it, and was ready to travel, as long as he found a companion.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>In the meantime, I read your letters and those you attached. In the others, I liked what was written about the Emperor's hunt, and what they have about the cavalry (it seems consistent with what I wrote about the Count of Buren). In Haller's letters, I am displeased (as is Haller himself) about the princes being almost forced to attend, who have learned otherwise until now! I agree with him, as he does not trust the Emperor. He hears mass, admits bishops, soldiers sin with impunity, especially against the Gospel! Why then trust him? It was written to Count George from Augsburg that priests there bribe poor citizens to attend mass. They came to a certain shoemaker and gave him a thaler to serve them for 14 days. The poor man accepted, came home, and suddenly died!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Gastius swears he sent Persius with a man, I don't know if a printer or typesetter, named Michael, bearded.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Philipp is in Wittenberg. He awaits the restoration of the school - if it is restored, he will stay there; otherwise, he will move according to the advice of good people. This is from his letters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Farewell in Christ with Theodor, Rudolf, and all good brothers. You know that we must pray. It is indeed strange in this calamity that the spirit is almost extinguished even in good men, so much do they fear for their lives, wives, and children. May the Lord comfort us! Amen. Basel, October 8, 1547. Yours, O. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger in his Lord. Zurich.</p>
