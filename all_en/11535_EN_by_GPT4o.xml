    <p xml:id="regest1">Does not want excessive thanks from Bullinger, who cannot even accept the gifted coin without giving another in return; expresses his gratitude. Bullinger's opinion on Luther's words is correct, but they should not be misinterpreted. Ten years ago, Luther overestimated the power of the Emperor in a writing; Blarer is pleased that the alleged critical remarks from Zurich [against the Protestant participants in the religious discussions] are false. According to the learned Johann Albrecht Widmanstetter, the inscription on the [coin sent to Bullinger] is Hebrew, while according to another source, the characters correspond to those on the Holy Robe in Trier. Has not yet heard anything from the Diet [at Regensburg], but will send the expected report [from Konrad] Zwick to Zurich as well; the report from Simon Grynaeus on the Worms religious discussion, which according to a letter from Leo Jud was to be delivered by Vadian, has not yet arrived; requests the transmission of this report, as the people of Konstanz have heard nothing about it except brief news about the negotiations on original sin. Only a small number of Protestant theologians have been invited to Regensburg so far; they believe less in a continuation of the religious discussion than in the Emperor's intention to oblige the Imperial Estates to finance the war against the Turks; God will punish Germany for its sins; all the more must one do penance. Greetings. Please advocate in Zurich for Christoph Schappeler, who, despite his fierce temperament, is a pious man.</p>

      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>I would believe you are laughing at my insignificance, which you magnify with such great amplifications and, as they say, make an elephant out of a fly, if it were not for the candor of your spirit and your inimitable sincerity, which I have long observed. For what reason, my thrice-venerable and dearest Bullinger, is it necessary to give such great thanks for such a small matter, especially to me, who is bound to you by so many obligations, which I write sincerely, that even if I were to lay down my life for your dignity, I would still seem to have achieved no part of your merits towards me, since by your favor, even after death, I will live on in your most illustrious writings (if there is any future), which have granted immortality to an otherwise obscure man like me. I will not mention here your other numerous and significant benefits towards me, which often fill me with shame, as I find nowhere from which I can respond to them even in the smallest part. Clearly, you understand the Lord's word that it is better to give than to receive, as you would not even accept any coin without returning another to us, which surpasses mine in that it is genuine, my imitation. Therefore, you leave me with nothing but to offer you verbal thanks and to pray to the heavenly Father and our cornucopia that He may fulfill my part and abundantly supply you with all that my wishes contain from the treasury of His generosity, so that you may never be deprived of any good. Nevertheless, I add that if any occasion arises, I will, to the best of my ability, gratify your singular kindness with all my heart. You encourage me to continue loving you, which is like urging a runner, as I prefer no mortal here before you, which I wish I could demonstrate with some serious testimony.</p>
      <p>What you wrote in your previous letters about the word that slipped from Luther against the Emperor and Ferdinand is entirely accurate; however, it often happens that such words are not received as they are spoken, so nothing should be rashly pronounced about him, who nearly a decade ago attributed too much to the Emperor's power in a certain writing, which I remember reading, and which greatly troubled the minds of some princes of the evangelical order.</p>
      <p>That you have cleared yourself and your ministers of the fabricated slander against you with such constancy and faith cannot be expressed how grateful it is to me; for those who preferred to believe vanity rather than hope for the best from you will learn of this. Truly, "blessed" (as he says), "is he who is shielded from a wicked tongue."</p>
      <p>The inscription on the shekel, which you consider Samaritan, was confirmed by Johann Albrecht Widmanstetter, who provided me with a copy and who is the most learned in Hebrew of all I have ever seen or heard, to be truly and genuinely Hebrew, and he almost convinced me. He has very ancient Hebrew books written in this wonderful script, which he reads fluently and effortlessly, but in such a way that you clearly understand Hebrew. However, a good man indicated that the robe of the Savior, which some impostors recently either discovered in Trier by their ingenuity or found by chance and restored, is interwoven with characters of this kind. If this is true, it would be plausible that what we see on the shekel is Samaritan, and it is nonetheless possible that this scholar's books are written in Hebrew with Samaritan letters, just as Jews today write in German with Hebrew characters.</p>
      <p>We have not heard a word about the Diet, what is happening there. But as soon as Zwick informs us of the situation, we will not let you remain ignorant, which we also wish to obtain from you in return. I hoped that we would receive from Vadian, a most dear man, what our Grynaeus diligently and elegantly wrote to you about the Worms colloquy; for thus my always observant and dearest brother Leo Jud, your fellow student, promised in a letter to me not long ago. However, whether Vadian is delaying or has sent everything to you, forgetting your mandate, or something else has intervened, we have certainly received nothing of this; therefore, it will be necessary for you to send us a copy of that writing; for apart from a few things about original sin, we have seen nothing. We will return everything faithfully as soon as we have read it.</p>
      <p>There are many things that allow no hope for the Emperor's mind, so demented by the papists. Our theologians, with very few exceptions, have not yet been called to Regensburg; they think that there will be no further continuation of the colloquy, but that the Emperor will attempt everything to gather the sinews of war from the Imperial Estates against the Turks. The Lord, who has long been angry with us for our sins, will undoubtedly exact severe penalties from our Germany unless we promptly return to the right path.</p>
      <p>Therefore, repentance must be urged upon us all the more, and everything must be done with the utmost vigilance and diligence to either avert or mitigate the impending evils by once again appeasing God with worthy fruits of repentance, who may keep you, not only for me but indeed for His whole church, in good health for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>I earnestly pray, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, that you always remember me and all of mine, as well as this our church, piously and Christianly before the Lord in your holy prayers. Diligently commend me and, on my behalf, greet the best and most learned men, as well as the dearest brothers Pellican, Leo, Theodor, Megander, and your other ministers in the Lord. All of ours send their greetings to you, especially my brother Thomas with sister Margaretha and Zwick, who request the patronage of your prayers before the throne of grace. Farewell. April 8, 1541.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer. If you can be present somewhere for Christoph Schappeler, I ask you to do so for my sake as well. He has lived blamelessly everywhere; he has a rather vehement temperament, which has greatly inconvenienced some churches. But this too should be forgiven to a good man, who believed he was doing everything out of divine zeal.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the best Antistes of the Zurich church, his venerable and dearest brother.</p>
