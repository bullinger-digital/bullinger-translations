      <p>Grace and peace, beloved Master Heinrich.</p>
      <p>Knowing that after our gracious lords of Zurich wrote here to an honorable council and requested my presence, and I was also personally heard regarding my intentions, my lords of an honorable council have granted my request. However, as I have understood from reliable people, it has greatly helped me that I have highly valued their power to grant me leave, so I have the same authority to request leave. Therefore now (praise and thanks to God and all brothers, especially you, who have worked on this), everything is settled here in Schaffhausen. I also assume it is the same with you in Zurich. However, if it turns out otherwise, I ask you to let me know by next Friday. Give Joachim a note, so if he finds someone from Schaffhausen, he can give them the letter. I am determined, as soon as I find a means of transport and am prepared here, I will come, if there is nothing with you that prevents me, for which I would need to wait.</p>
      <p>Tell Master Leo that I thank him kindly for his fatherly reproach and have also accepted it as a child from a father, but I will (if God lets us live) not answer him in writing but orally, as I have never been able to express all my concerns in writing.</p>
      <p>God protect you all.</p>
      <p>From Schaffhausen, July 1, 1534.</p>
      <p>Your entirely devoted Beat.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, his beloved lord and brother.</p>
