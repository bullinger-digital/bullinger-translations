      <p>S. There was no need, my father, for you to excuse your silence so anxiously.</p>
      <p>For although I greatly desired to understand what you thought of my writing which I sent to you, I never doubted that something more serious prevented your response to me. For I myself experience this, as I am not burdened with as many or as great affairs as you, yet I am often compelled to disappoint the expectations of friends in replying and to suspend my own desire. But enough of this.</p>
      <p>As for my writing, I am glad it is not disapproved by you and I ask that, as you do, we measure the words and deeds of others not by syllables and letters, but by a mind truly endowed with Christian charity. He who has given us to be of one mind in Him regarding the matter itself, I hope, will never allow us to disagree bitterly over formulas. And as you also warned in your last letters, that you fear it may be seized upon by adversaries, I will take care that your warning is not in vain. For it must be done in this way, especially at this time, when I do not doubt that the Saxon rage will flare up, not so much in Jena as in Gehenna, with the removal of the one whom they somewhat feared. But the Lord lives who will scatter the wicked on a day when they expect nothing of the sort.</p>
      <p>You are surely expecting me to send you a volume about French affairs. And certainly, if I wished either to jest or to write the truth, there would be no lack of material for a large volume. But it would be too laborious, even if there were enough leisure, to distinguish truth from falsehood. For it is incredible how many vain things have been reported to us daily for the past four months: this was the main reason why we decided to remain silent rather than mix the most false things with the true. But now behold, you will receive the summary of the matter, described briefly but truly, along with these letters, unless you have already received it from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>What followed is almost of this kind. In Dauphiné and Provence, where preaching was done too untimely and against the advice of the ministers, there was incredible disturbance both among our people and those who attacked them. Finally, however, the consternation of our people gave courage to them.</p>
      <p>Thus it happened that our people were miserably scattered here and there, but the enemies, having obtained an unexpected bloodless victory, used it very leniently, if you consider the outcome, although it is well known that they restrained their hands more out of fear of greater evil than for any other reason. Only seven were beheaded in Vienne in Dauphiné, and that as seditious, although it is certain that the charge of sedition was falsely imposed on them. Many fled, so much so that the adversaries who remained at home feared more for themselves than those who fled. Many were killed and intercepted on both sides.</p>
      <p>In other parts of France, the storm was much less, and what is surprising, in those very regions where the matter took place, the churches were not disturbed at all.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the wave passed by so that it scarcely touched the heads of the pious, and now their number has increased much more than before. Although the adversaries are not ignorant of this, they are so struck that they have never feared more for themselves. If only you could read and understand how many and how different edicts they have written in one month. You would indeed marvel at their incredible fear, with no one pursuing them, except Him whom they least fear. What could not be obtained by any of your embassies in previous years, they have now granted voluntarily to those not asking, that all captives everywhere be released. And it is known that many were released even with open confession.</p>
      <p>But yet the injustice of the judges has caused some to still be held in chains. In short, the adversaries have never trembled more than they do now.</p>
      <p>The presidents of the parliaments have been summoned.</p>
      <p>What the outcome will be is uncertain.</p>
      <p>I expect nothing but greater evils, since the Guises do not know that it is not permissible for them to remain in the kingdom with the authority of the princes intact, and therefore they will now plot everything against them, either secretly or openly, as in extreme desperation. But the princes, if they will have regard for their own lives, will undoubtedly take the ultimate counsels. If they dare strongly enough, it will soon be over for the Guises, since everyone will turn to their side: if not, I see that the state of that kingdom will be miserable, since one part has already become accustomed to servitude, the other will never submit to the yoke except unwillingly. Therefore, my father, if ever before, now is the time to commend miserable France to the Lord in your prayers.</p>
      <p>As for us, we still stand wonderfully, and we hope we will continue to stand. The calumnies brought against us cannot be refuted by better or more certain witnesses than those whom they falsely accuse of being sent by us. We have done what we could both by word and by writings, as God is our witness.</p>
      <p>However, what we foresaw would happen has occurred, and we could not avoid it in any way, namely that patience has turned into fury. Therefore, let the adversaries blame themselves, not us, of which I also do not doubt that they will finally pay just penalties.</p>
      <p>About the naval defeat of Philip, and the Duke of Savoy almost intercepted by the Turks at Nice, I do not doubt that you have already heard. Thus it happens by the just judgment of God that those who prepare evil for others abroad find ruin at home.</p>
      <p>He lost 72 of his nobles, redeemed some captives for twelve thousand crowns. He himself, or rather (as he commonly wishes to be called), his highness, barely escaped while fleeing, and the Philistine David, that is, the Piedmontese churches, preserved them as if they were already reduced to the last extremity. But for us who see these judgments of God so near, may faith and hope increase, so that we may proceed more and more. The Frenchman is entirely occupied with composing the English and Scottish war, because he fears domestic conspiracies. If only he would learn to revere God, so that we may all be of one mind in Him.</p>
      <p>But behold, while I excuse the brevity of the letters, I have written a volume. Therefore, you no longer have reason to complain about brevity.</p>
      <p>But I ask that, since more is not possible now, you share these same things with common friends, and especially with Mr. Ambrosius Blaurer, my best parent, and indeed primarily the history of the Ambosian tumult. For I know he has long been expecting it, and it was indeed very troublesome for me not to satisfy his expectation for so long. Those who deliver these letters to you were carefully recommended to me by Mr. Peucer, whom I therefore do not doubt to commend to you and the other colleagues. Farewell, my father, I ask you to greet Mr. Martyr, Gwalter, Gesner, and the other colleagues accurately in my name. May the Lord Jesus bless you more and more and grant us all to fulfill our duty so that we may finally receive the crown of glory from Him. Geneva, June 26.</p>
      <p>Yours, Beza.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zürich, my most esteemed brother and fellow minister. In Zürich.</p>
