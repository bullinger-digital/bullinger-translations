      <p>S. I wrote to you in recent days having nothing new at that time. Now suddenly many sad things are being reported, which I wish were not true; yet they are affirmed in such a way that I think they are too true. However, I give it as I have it. The true news will soon be known. It is reported that King Philip has arrived in Flanders in person with large forces; and that the King and Queen of France are proceeding there to meet him, and that the plan is to join his council and subscribe to its execution, to restore the mass everywhere and to drive all ministers from the kingdom; that the Count of Condé, having been proscribed from the court, is gathering forces and that the German cavalry is already prepared to aid him, and thus the greatest war is at the doorstep; that in the Swiss camps, all those from evangelical places who did not want to swear to the destruction of the new religion, as they call it, have been dismissed. This is confirmed by the fact that our men, who had gone to serve as soldiers, are all returning. One of them is already in the city and affirms this; others are said to be already with their own people, who are working in the vineyards here and there. The one who returned, who is from the Amadeus family, also reports that all the people from Schaffhausen are returning and that the people from Valais were almost the first to refuse to fight against religion; therefore, they too are returning. But we will soon have more certain information about all this.</p>
      <p>Now these things are reported so suddenly that I do not yet know whether I should believe them all. But I am concerned that there is too much truth in it.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, Mr. Coccius, a minister from Basel, has also come here, sent by the academy there; he announces that Mr. Gilbert Cognatus, through the work of Cardinal Granvelle of Arras, has been dragged into prison at Dole and that the court there has been ordered to form a process against him according to the Spanish Inquisition; thus there is a danger that this good man may perish, who nevertheless is of great authority in Burgundy and under whose protection many good men have taken refuge in those regions, whose destruction is linked with his death. He has therefore persuaded our people, who otherwise have much trade with the Burgundians because of proximity and salt mines, to write on his behalf to the Senate of Dole and the Archbishop of Besançon.</p>
      <p>May the Lord make this intercession effective and free him! Otherwise, he loved this danger too much, having been involved in it for so long and not wanting to tear himself away from it, so it is not surprising that this is happening to him now. May the Lord preserve him and his churches everywhere! For it seems that Satan is trying his utmost; may the Lord subdue him under the feet of his own! I expect more certain information from you. As for this relative of yours, he conducts himself moderately; he was very neglected in Bruges before he came here; thus he came to this school very unrefined, so that, if it were not for your name, he would have been sent back there. Now he does what he can and needs encouragement; therefore, urge him not to spare his efforts in studying; for he is somewhat lax. As I received these things hastily, so I write to you hastily; consider everything favorably and greet all yours in my name. Our people also greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, September 18, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
