      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, your letters were delivered to me later, and I had no one from our people who was traveling, whom I indeed knew. Therefore, I am thinking of sending letters to the most honorable man, Lord von Cham, your consul.</p>
      <p>I am therefore brief, because I hope you can have the complete story both from the conversation and from the acts. The main point is: the matter was brought to the utmost danger, and if the Swiss had not arrived so opportunely, the matter would not have been resolved without slaughter and bloodshed. Among the envoys, the work and authority of the Zurich consul stood out the most; but also Pfyffer of Lucerne showed himself to be dutiful. I confess that I owe this primarily to God, and secondly to the Swiss, that Rhaetia is unharmed.</p>
      <p>Pfyffer claims to have settled many disputes and lawsuits; but he was so unwilling that he would never have become so in his lifetime. He also had dealings with people accordingly.</p>
      <p>But what do you think is on my mind, who have been involved in these troubles for a long time? It will now first come to a tearing and quarrel when the Confederates come away. - In what state the affairs of the Gallicians are, you will understand from the consul, to whom I have explained the whole matter.</p>
      <p>I have never been so in my entire life.</p>
      <p>The main point is: he had a lawsuit with them in a village called Yiß; because there they served, after they came from him. And when Galitius claimed that their oath and faith were not to be trusted, they insisted on it and offered themselves to the authorities, a judgment was passed that such belongs now to a higher court (since the Yißers have no high court); Galitius should now bear the costs; they reserved for everyone else to seek what they think they deserve, etc.</p>
      <p>But the prostitute has called the consuls here several times and called for justice and help, but told the story to deaf ears, etc. That's how it stands, and no one does anything about it, and now it's the holy time, and young and old cry out, and people stomp their feet over it. If one were to give a resolution to the matter and show him grace, it would be different and not all the burden would lie on me.</p>
      <p>I have diligently done my duty; but from this one thing you can gather more; where honesty is absent.</p>
      <p>I return yours and have immense thanks. I have not yet received my copies from Geneva; friends there promised more, but without success. Farewell, reverend Father in Christ, and tell Mr. Collin, my father-in-law, that things are in a moderate state with us. Chur, April 3, 1565.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>Postscript.</p>
      <p>Today, that prostitute brought a child into the city and went around the streets and, if I am not mistaken (so they say), took it to the consul's house. I would like to see if they will remain completely silent.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend Father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
