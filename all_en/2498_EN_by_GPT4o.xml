      <p>Greetings. You can hardly believe, my dearest compater, how much grief I am not only affected by, but almost consumed by, because of that unexpected downfall of our magistrate. I cannot fully understand which Satan has incited them to this.</p>
      <p>Indeed, all these things were not only done but also completed without our knowledge and secretly. We barely learned late what had been decided, and the silence of all the deacons was the only testimony to us of a troubled conscience.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we must pray to the Lord to mercifully forgive us such a sin and to inform minds differently, so that they may be more rightly affected towards the business of piety, lest, while we imitate the judgments of Pilate, we also finally meet his fate. What could ever happen more unworthy of our profession? Is this the fruit of so many assemblies held for this cause? If ever I feared the heavy hand and vengeance of the Lord, certainly now I shudder, nor do I wonder if ours hear dire things from you, although such insults cannot correct this evil. I do not know where our republic will finally fall. I ponder more in my heart than I dare to write or complain about. May the Lord look upon and help us! To this common evil is added another, also stirred up by those of our students. I write to Ammianus in the name of all about what has been decreed concerning them. They ought to have been punished differently; but that common disturbance of minds did not want to admit a heavier punishment now. We retain the doctor; Delsperger has obtained a position in Brugg; we send back the other two. We will also send them two others, whom we ask you to have recommended. We will take care here that nothing more serious arises. You likewise suppress there, as much as you can, the petulance of some in speaking ill. Even if ours have erred, which cannot be concealed, yet why such great accusations? I know you grieve as much as you can; therefore, restrain, which I do not doubt you otherwise do.</p>
      <p>We would not burden you with ours, unless we feared that if sent elsewhere, they would adopt other minds; we give this to the concord of our churches, nor are there lacking those who would wish to seize the opportunity to send them elsewhere; but they have not been able to accomplish this so far.</p>
      <p>As for our affairs, I cannot burden you with listening to the French disputes. We fear that Calvin will come here to pursue his injury; for he was not sufficiently satisfied recently, because Zebedäus and the other were not deposed. I recently sent you his booklet against Westphal, which I have not yet seen. Meanwhile, among us, the people of Grandson, after those of Orbe and Montaniacum, have also expelled the mass along with the priests and monks. Would that true piety be so dear to them as they explode these superstitions. I have nothing else to write about other matters, except that you pray to the Lord for us, that he may not lead us into temptation and may lead those who have once fallen out again through his grace. All of ours greet you. May all of yours be safe. Bern, December 12, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his lord and most esteemed compater.</p>
