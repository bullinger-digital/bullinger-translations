      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I did not want you to be unaware that the oligarchs of the Five Places have relented in their anger and have written back to us, allowing that the governor sent by us to the people of Wagental may request an oath with the invocation of the divine name alone, and then compel no one to attend mass. They themselves will ensure that those who promised to profess the pagan faith will adhere to the agreements. For in the Freie Ämter or Wagental, they are in no peace and have submitted to the Five Places. They want to keep the people there. None of our people agreed to the previous demand. They realized this, and thus they have relented in their anger.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Last day of June 1535.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, his esteemed lord.</p>
