      <p>[... 11. 1553] I promised, if I remember correctly, that if you were to send young men to us for the sake of studies, I would not neglect them because some of those who lived at my table had offended me. For why should the doors be closed to those who were not at fault, for which perhaps another was excluded, nor do they seem to intend anything else for which they should be prohibited from access and conversation. Therefore, I would have clearly felt and in reality, your young men, whom you sent to the autumn fairs, would have experienced some sign of humanity and benevolence towards themselves and their masters, if they had at least deigned to greet me when they came here, which, however, was omitted by them, and I think it should not be attributed to them as much as to the slanders about me by some of those who then returned to you, and I know very well who among them especially exerted a strenuous effort so that they would not seek my company. However, I do not want to cause any inconvenience to anyone individually with this confidence, which the authors themselves will one day regret and be ashamed of their mutual treachery towards me, which so far could be attributed to youthful ingratitude and arrogance, to which many things are to be inscribed and forgiven to him who deals with such minds. When the school was transferred elsewhere, I went to Frankfurt and there I married a widow, a niece from the sister of Philipp Melanchthon, left by a deceased doctor, and finally returned to Marburg at the beginning of March. Where, because your young men finally came with all the other Swiss and in a matter pertaining to the defense of their honor sought my advice, I communicated this to them familiarly, to which they easily obeyed, nor did it harm them to have complied, then I invited them all to dinner together, to remove from them any suspicion of an alienated mind. We were more than sufficiently cheerful. Unless I had first certainly ascertained that they all behaved honorably throughout the winter, I would not have bestowed so much honor on all, but only on those who lived quietly and decently in public above the others. For I do not rise to those who indulge in drunkenness, gambling, lust, nocturnal wanderings rather than rest, studies, and honesty. Therefore, I would like that dinner, to which your invited young men attended, to serve as the best testimony. May the Lord make them prove themselves more worthy of a more splendid one day by day, as I have no doubt about most of them. The plague, having killed with the plague, seems to be completely buried, so much so that there is a constant rumor that the prince with his whole family and court will come here shortly and stay here for the whole year, nor is there any doubt about the school, that it will return here after the fairs if not sooner, unless the buried plague rises from the grave. Uncertain reports are being spread about the tumults of wars; horsemen are being enlisted everywhere and secretly hired, in whose name or against whom, it is still hidden. We are at least predicted to maintain peace this year by this argument, that we hear the prince wants to live here, which he does not usually do when danger is imminent. Farewell. Hastily from Marburg.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious, likewise the best man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy in the ministry of the word of God of the ZÃ¼rich church, his reverend lord.</p>
