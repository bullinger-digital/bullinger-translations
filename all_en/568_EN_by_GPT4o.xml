      <p>Greetings. What my opinion is regarding the document of agreement composed between you there and Mr. Calvin, dearest Bullinger in the Lord, I wrote to you eight days ago through Mr. Eberhard, so there is no need to mention it again now. You know my mind: I wish for nothing more than that, with all discord removed, the truth of the Gospel of God may be presented to the churches in such a way that the people of God are edified, and that finally the knowledge of God, which has been granted quite abundantly in these latter times, may be joined with the fear and reverence of God. Therefore, I greatly congratulate your diligence, which I see is aimed at ensuring that this sacramental controversy is removed, so that the spirits of the ministers of Christ may be more closely united, and that they may more vigilantly attend to the flock of the Lord against the most wicked Satan. As for what specifically concerns this church, and what must be either endured or attempted in it, I leave to those who have more authority and experience. I am here as a foreigner, having nothing else to do but to continue completing my public readings in the Psalter. I commend myself to your faithfulness.</p>
      <p>May the Lord take care of His churches. If you need anything from me, let me know. Greetings to all yours in my name and in the name of mine, who by the grace of God are beginning to be well. Also, greetings to all my lords and brothers. Please remind Gervasius to write something to me at least.</p>

      <p>Yesterday was the anniversary of my departure from Augsburg because of the accepted Interim. Thanks be to the Lord who has confined the afflictions of His people to a fleeting and transitory time.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Musculus in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my lord and brother in Christ, much esteemed.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
