      <p>May the Lord and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ increase in you the spirit of strength and understanding.</p>
      <p>Dearest brother, I have received two letters from you in the past few days. Although I have not yet replied, and your fellow countryman has certainly promised to deliver my response, I now reply.</p>
      <p>First, you recommended two, and if you recommend more, they will be most highly recommended to me in your name. After the synod, all the provinces were assigned to the ministers, so that now no place remains; however, it will not harm us to know sincere brothers, so that in the future, when they are needed in the ministry, they can be more safely appointed.</p>
      <p>Then, you will soon see what and how Capito dealt with us, when they come out of the Frobenian press. I was entirely focused on this, so that for the sake of Megander, which had been remarkably contentious among the ministers, the senate, the deacons, and the people, it could be resolved happily without the judgment of prophetic liberty, and the ministers would recognize that the matter is best advanced not by bitter jests, but by sweet and witty modesty. He divided the acts by chapters and, considering the man's weakness, took on more labor than anyone would have dared to demand. Simon Sulcerus, a young man of great promise, a student of Grynaeus and an alumnus of our city's studies, will translate the same into Latin, so that our senate may have the first fruits of their studies. Whatever pleases or displeases you, you will freely comment with us. I wish everything to be done openly and from the heart, as if in the sight of the one God and Lord Jesus Christ, whom we must also regard as one in all things. Know this, that the man was so pleasing to the magistrate, the people, and the ministers, as if a deity had descended from heaven, and he conducted everything in such a way that they seem most peaceful.</p>
      <p>But since I do not yet have the explanation of the study plan and Pharaoh's hardening, I would like to have it when you can steal some leisure time. As you promise the explanation of the prophetic office and the Hebrews, I wish you to perform it as successfully as possible; for you can hardly believe how much your spirit and that of Pellican pleases me. Perhaps the Lord does not want those who would agree best among themselves to be together, so that we may learn to break our affections and submit to one another and defer. I wonder what is delaying our Pellican, that his long-awaited works do not finally appear; encourage the man not to bury the talent entrusted to him, and to consider that while he has provided the world with what he has, even greater things await others. Let him serve and dispense his own to the brothers, and not think to exhaust the treasure of Scripture. And you too, do not keep us in suspense any longer. I spoke with Froschauer in Bern, so that whatever comes out of your or Pellican's workshop in his prints, he may send from the beginning.</p>
      <p>Moreover, Megander is doing well in the assembly and also with us. Everything has become more peaceful. As you are concerned for the concord of both cities, I am also concerned, knowing that each would easily perish without the other. Someone from your people wrote to Lord In Hag that it could be done very well through the people of Basel. But other beginnings will be needed. If only your Rösti, a man most pleasing to us, had even the smallest business with us and spoke with a few of our more sensible people according to his own plan; the beginnings of peace would be easy to establish. You think and command what you wish.</p>
      <p>Finally, I would like you to quickly indicate where our letters could be safely delivered to Capito. For I was going to write serious matters to him. Andreas from Wylmäringen has been called to the diaconate. You can write to him. You will greet Leo, Pellican, your relative, and Zwingli's widow. Let her not be anxious for her little son; he is entirely ours and a boy of good character; Trempius will provide paternal services, and we will also provide when our help is needed. I hear that a province has been entrusted to your brother.</p>
      <p>Farewell, so that we may write more often. The times and the troubles and dangers of the times and people demand it.</p>
      <p>Bern, February 9, 1532.</p>
      <p>Yours as his own, Berchtold Haller.</p>
      <p>To Huldrych Bullinger, preacher of the word of God in Zurich, a man most learned and pious, a brother by far the dearest of all and forever.</p>
