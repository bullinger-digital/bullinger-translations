      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Although I have not written to you for such a long time, do not think that anything has diminished from the goodwill with which we love each other mutually in Christ, nor from the respect with which I was accustomed to revere you greatly. For it was not due to any negligence on my part, as I could have wished for nothing more than to converse with you through letters, especially in these miserable times, amidst the wickedness and treachery of men, from which I could have drawn consolation and learned many things that pertain to the highest piety. But since the papists have harassed me so far and daily torment me more bitterly, that they leave me almost no leisure, let alone for writing, but not even for thinking, there is also the hostile attitude of this English ambassador towards me because of the gospel, who does not want anything to be provided to the pious shaken by persecution nor to receive them in this asylum, that is, in this royal house, a unique refuge in all of Italy, lest his name be ill-spoken among others, indeed he has threatened to throw me out of the house if I persist, which I would rather choose than to fail the oppressed members of Christ in any way. There is also something far more serious, which has just been announced, that our king has passed away, so that neither here nor in England would we be safe from the savagery of the impious; for there everything would have to be feared, lest they be immediately reduced to their former state. But I hope it will prove false, as a rumor has brought to us almost uncertain. These things therefore compel me, most kind Bullinger, to think about departure, and I fear that you may see me there before my letters, except for these. Meanwhile, do not cease to write to us, and at the same time take care that this corner, which remains for the pious from all others, is not deceitfully snatched from you, since men now use a thousand arts. Indeed, you can avoid this in one way, if you are unanimous among yourselves, may God grant it, as I hope to be able to know soon from your letters.</p>
      <p>I ask you again and again to do this, that is, to inform me as soon as possible and accurately, in what state your affairs and those of your allies are.</p>
      <p>I greet Master Pellican, if he lives, Master Gwalther and Master Conrad the physician in my name. Farewell in the Lord and love me. If certain English nobles pass through there, as I suppose, you will commend my cause to them, so that they may favor me when they arrive in England, and pretend that you have not received my letters.</p>
      <p>Given in Venice on the fifth day before the Nones of October 1548.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Balthasar Altieri</p>
      <p>To the most adorned with highest piety and learning, Master Heinrich Bullinger, minister of Zürich, always to be honored as lord and brother. Zürich.</p>
