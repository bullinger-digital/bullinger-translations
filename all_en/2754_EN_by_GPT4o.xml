      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>We have received both your earlier and later letters discussing the matter of the oath, and we thank you immensely for them. We have not neglected our duty, we have turned over every stone both in public discourse and privately; however, we could not achieve anything other than what our greater council has decreed, namely that we may swear by the name of God alone and punish transgressors, with the delegates leading, in whatever words they wish, that they will swear and cannot or will not be separated from the Swiss by any means. This decree has been sent to Basel; for it was agreed upon even by your most esteemed delegates that our people should first decide what they must do, and (but secretly) send it there, then the people of Basel will attach their decree to ours and send everything to Bern, and the people of Bern will send everything to you, so that a better plan can be devised for what should be done. I fear our people will not easily yield their opinion unless something else is found through the delegates in Aarau that seems more in line with the honor of God and the safety of the country. We must pray to the Lord to guide their hearts to the glory of His name. This is written hastily; for I could not write more as the messenger was about to leave. Our council is amazed at how we, who are from the sacred assemblies, could have learned of these things; for they wanted these matters to be secret. See, my dearest Bullinger, in what state our affairs are. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, October 20, 1555.</p>
      <p>My fellow workers greet you.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the pious and well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zürich, his beloved lord and brother, to be delivered. Zürich.</p>
