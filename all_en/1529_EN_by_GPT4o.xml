      <p>As soon as I received the letters from our prince addressed to your eminence, I decided that no delay should be interposed, so that you might enjoy the letters of the most illustrious men and princes with the greatest joy as soon as possible. It cannot be expressed how much joy they brought me, partly because I knew they would be most pleasing to you, a great and distinguished man, and partly because the prince's utmost generosity towards us was shown at that very time by Schinner, by which we will be able to protect and defend the course of our studies much better in the future. For he gave Alexander six pounds, induced by your recommendation, and to me five, although not long before he had generously distributed ten marks. Nor do I rejoice so much in this munificence as I exult and triumph in the prince's utmost humanity and benevolence towards us. From this matter, indeed, I easily understand and gladly acknowledge that I am bound to your dignity by the greatest benefit; for unless you had placed us in such favor with this prince through your office of recommendation, we would not only lack the duke's generosity, but we would not even be able to safely pursue any kind of the best arts. And to come to that which you seem to expect from me by your right, consider and believe that you have not only achieved that I embrace you with perpetual observance, which indeed does not concern you, but certainly concerns me greatly, but also that I will strive to ensure that you never regret this inducement of mind and will to love and help me. I would promise this to you more extensively, unless I intended to approve myself to you by deed, not by words, and to surpass all your thoughts with my duties. So that you do not think I have written this rashly, I wish these letters to have the force of a bond, not a letter, with you, so that you may deal with me as if with sealed documents, unless I most sacredly observe everything I have promised you here, that is, I will surpass your opinion in cultivating and defending your dignity with my studies. Thus far these things.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new to write to you, not even a rumor; for the voices of all the furious ones are calmed and suppressed. This very island is made most peaceful and tranquil by the best and most holy magistrates. The Duke of Suffolk recently said to Schinner for certain that unless the Earl of Warwick had interceded as a suppliant for the safety and dignity of the Duke of Somerset, the sentence of death for the prince, already pronounced publicly, would have been executed by the executioner Calethanus.</p>
      <p>Here you could see how varied and changeable the course of life is, how fickle and volatile fortune is, how great the infidelities among friends are, how timely the simulations of princes are, how miserable and utterly ruined the life of courtiers is.</p>
      <p>A synod was begun to be held by order of the royal majesty on the day before the Ides of December by the best and most learned men, who deliberate and consult about the just discipline of morals and the integrity of doctrine. The prejudices about all these matters will be made by the Archbishop of Canterbury and Peter Martyr, the Bishop of York and London, the Chancellor of England now created, formerly the Bishop of Ely, and our Schinner, almost the sole public actor and leader of all religious controversies. All these matters will then fall into the approval of all those who are to be from the parliament. This is the judgment of the highest and lowest men. What will happen is uncertain. Would that they could consult for the salvation of the miserable and lamentable republic of Christ. Cox, a man most loving of you, as soon as anything is decided, has affirmed that he wishes to write to you lovingly.</p>
      <p>Now, that which you have promised of your own accord to the Duke of Northumberland, I wish you to take care of with your faith and diligence and for my observance towards you, not newly established but already long-standing: strive that some book of yours be described to his highness as honorably and as soon as possible. It is of great interest to the faith of both of us that you stand by your promises, but especially of religion and even of sanctity itself, which I am certainly persuaded will be both increased and preserved among many by this means. Therefore, I advise you, incited by your benefits and by my love for religion, to pursue with all care and industry all the fruit, both common and private, to which you have been inflamed by God himself, and never to bend your will and constancy, which I have always admired and always proclaimed, to the favor or authority of anyone. There is a great opinion of you among men, a great commendation of your doctrine, a great memory of your writings. The prince is a most illustrious man and will easily allow the eternal proclamation of his labors to be entrusted to you in writing; nor will he see only a proclamation attributed to him, but also a grave testimony imparted to a famous and great man. I wish you to inform me as diligently as possible both what you are doing and what you think you will do. I expect your letters again and again, and indeed such as I most desire.</p>
      <p>Specifically, I want you to be asked to include the letters you are going to give to our prince and to John Cheke, the instructor of the royal majesty, with mine and seal them carefully. I also dealt with you diligently about this matter in previous letters, that is, on the day before the Nones of December. He is, believe me, a most learned man, most loving of you, and has deserved very well of me. He promises affectionately, induced by your recommendation to Hooper, to deal with the cause of Alexander Schmuz with Warwick. Therefore, I wish him to understand from you that this matter will be pleasing to you and very suitable for our studies. Indeed, the matter could have been beautifully completed before, when I was recently in London; for the prince himself inquired of Warwick about the young man commended to him by you of his own accord, and constantly affirmed that he would not only support the studies of the excellent young man from his own resources, but also that he wished to solicit the king himself about this matter.</p>
      <p>These things from Cheke. As for me, I was not anxious about the outcome of the promise, because I saw that the matter would happily fall into place of its own accord, since you had fulfilled your promises, and we perhaps would most need patronage. Farewell, most learned man. January 10, 1552. Oxford.</p>
      <p>Your disciple and son in Christ, Johannes von Ulm.</p>
      <p>To the most eminent and learned Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of ZÃ¼rich, his dearest teacher.</p>
