      <p>Greetings. You rightly consider what kind of people we have here in the republic, and I wish that not almost all the more powerful were so affected! Few remain in the senate (though from the lower ranks) who wish to retain freedom intact.</p>
      <p>It is most unfortunate that religion and the salvation of the faithful and their petitions are everywhere used as a pretext. By this appearance, the simpler citizens are deceived.</p>
      <p>I am truly amazed that they can bear our contradictions so patiently; they indeed gnash their teeth in a remarkable way, yet they dissimulate; for I have often expected that we would be summoned to the senate.</p>
      <p>But perhaps they are waiting for a conclusion, so that afterwards they may oppress us with common authority. May the Lord break their plans.</p>
      <p>You can imagine what our fate is now here, those of us who are teaching and acting as pastors. May the Lord strengthen and guard His own! Meanwhile, nothing more has been done in this matter.</p>
      <p>I consider it an unfortunate and ill-fated omen that the messenger, who was recently sent with letters to Lyon to the Bishop of Limoges, perished on the journey before he reached him.</p>
      <p>Would that the whole scheme would perish in this way! That would be a favorable omen for me. Otherwise, nothing new.</p>
      <p>We are very concerned about the dealings with the lord of Saxony.</p>
      <p>May God send it for the best; for it might well be a bad affair. I would like to hear what comes from Baden.</p>
      <p>I return the letters of Fabricius and give great thanks for them here.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else from elsewhere.</p>
      <p>We have greatly angered the people of Geneva once, because we did not consent to the alliance; they consider us gross donkeys, as we now bear our own account and not that of the common church. But it seems to me, they would like to misuse us as donkeys.</p>
      <p>The copy of Musculus is being printed as it is; it has helped so much that they have been warned; otherwise, they would have cut out splendid passages and put others in their place. They dare not omit now, as they have been warned.</p>
      <p>You will see what they wanted to omit when the copies are completed. I have nothing else now, except that I pray the Lord to keep you safe for His church for a very long time. Dr. Steiger, Diesbach, ZÃ¤hender, my father-in-law, brothers, and fellow ministers, especially Musculus, my mother, and also my wife greet you. Greet all yours in our name.</p>
      <p>Bern, March 10, 1565.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my lord and godfather, to be honored with the greatest respect always.</p>
