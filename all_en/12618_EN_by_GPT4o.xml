    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks be to God for the previous successes of the [Schmalkaldic League]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The main concern of Haller's letter [No. 2560] is the appointment of some pastors [from Zurich to Augsburg]. The request is legitimate, even though Zurich has a large area to provide with pastors, the Zurich church is relatively poor compared to others, and it does not have so many talented forces at its disposal that it could also supply others with them. Therefore, Haller should ensure that with the church properties [of Augsburg], excellent forces are trained for the [local] church service. That is what matters!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- However, Haller should not worry: Bullinger will do everything possible to ensure that [the people of Augsburg] receive some pastors shortly.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings and blessings. I give thanks to God, who has thus far granted victory to our cause! We must earnestly pray to Him, that He does not abandon our cause and does not lead His people into temptation.</p>

      <p>The main concern of your letter is the appointment of some ministers. We recognize here that you are not asking for anything unjust. But see to it that you are entirely committed to ensuring that from the church properties, excellent talents are nurtured, to whom the care of the churches can be entrusted. We have a vast field; we need more ministers. We are poor if one compares us to other churches. We are not endowed with as many talents as we and others need. Therefore, see to it that you are diligent in this matter. Believe me, the crux of the matter lies here.</p>

      <p>However, I do not want you to be anxious at present. I will be entirely committed to ensuring that you have some, and indeed, that you have them shortly.</p>
