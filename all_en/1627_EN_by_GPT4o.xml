      <p>You once feared, most illustrious Bullinger, that the papists might expel me. But cease to fear these things; for Galitius himself is diligently working and ensuring that we 15 ministers, who are of the Italian language, are sent to ruin from here, indeed he deals with us more harshly than they have been accustomed to. For they only accused us of not sparing the papacy; he shouts that we have become Anabaptists. What could be more pleasing to the carnal-minded? What occasion could be more delightful? They would hardly have dared to hope for better.</p>
      <p>What I write is very true, do not doubt it. As far as I am concerned: if only I had been expelled two years ago! Certainly, my flesh would have wished for this; for I would have lived far more comfortably. But if this happens, we will see many churches in Raetia desolated, which, if they do not have an Italian pastor, cannot obtain any other, not to mention the brothers who have fled here and will be forced to return to Italy, that is, to the executioners. May the will of the Lord be done. Again, I affirm that what I write is true; for Galitius, I say, defames us with great concern and affirms that we are seditious (because we often gain new little churches for the gospel), not only imbued with the most pestilent doctrines; he even adds: "I think they should be expelled." I came to Chiavenna, and I am dealing with the doctors. For I am suffering from scabies. But shortly, as I hope, I will be freed and immediately come to you. Finally, the pimp has reconciled with the harlot, which I think you have heard; know that the matter is very true. The whole of Italy, indeed the whole world, now hangs on Germany. May God be present with His churches and restore their former liberty. Almost all the masked fathers have dispersed. One of them, a Spaniard, traveling through the Bergamo countryside, was caught evading the toll; for he pretended to be carrying books with him and meanwhile had loaded six mules with cloth, suddenly turned from theologian to merchant. But the most reverend lord cloth-seller paid the penalty. In Italy, affliction and persecution rage. Two good brothers perished in prison, one in Florence, the other in Venice. There is suspicion that they were removed by poison. Farewell and be well with your whole family, school, and church.</p>
      <p>In Chiavenna, the day before the calends of May 1552. Vergerius.</p>
      <p>Having already written the letter, I heard something about Ludovico, my nephew. I have decided to send him back to his own; but while I come, I beg you, Heinrich Bullinger, to ensure that nothing worse happens. May 4th.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my honorable brother. In Zurich.</p>
