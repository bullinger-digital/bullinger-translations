    <p xml:id="regest1">Aquilomontanus thanks Bullinger for writing to him so kindly through [Gerhard] Westerburg [not received].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Last winter, he was ill three times and confined to bed. At Christmas, he felt close to death and made his will. Friends and neighbors comforted his wife [...]. Although he is not yet fully recovered, [he still conducts services] in the church. So that he does not have to climb the pulpit, he sits on the steps of the choir, from where he proclaims [the Gospel]. He can eat and drink, but he has no appetite. He believes that God has admonished him with this premonition of death. Now he hopes for the summer, as he can hardly bear the cold. Bullinger should pray for him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- [In Friesland] the best men are being infected by the fanatical views of the Anabaptists. Their prophet [Menno Simons] issued a ban on listening to [Reformed clergy] and attending their services. Presumably, [the Anabaptists] want to drive out the [Reformed] so that they cannot be accused and their greed is not exposed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Samuel [Pellikan] will have reported on the [situation in Friesland]. Aquilomontanus, who had to preach twice in the morning due to the absence of his colleague [...], could not particularly take care of [Samuel Pellikan] and Gerhard [thom Camph]. He wrote to the [Zurich] pastors at that time and hopes that they received his letter well. Bullinger and [Rudolf] Gwalther should greet all church servants.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Aquilomontanus regrets Megander's death.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- If the rumor circulating in [Friesland] about Luther's death is true, then one could hope for peace, if not for some who, having committed themselves to their teacher, seek victory more than truth. If the people of Zurich have to enter the arena again, Aquilomontanus would like to once again urge them to Christian moderation. It is important to trust in Christ, who defends his cause himself. Bullinger knows that stubborn heretics can only be defeated through prayer and spiritual fasting.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Bucer has tried, through a lengthy letter to [Johannes] a Lasco, to defend his inconsistency and Luther's opinion. A Lasco responded with his usual mildness. Aquilomontanus is surprised by Bucer's fickleness, who, like everyone else, probably thinks he possesses the truth.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Regards.</p>

      <p>Greetings, most sincere of friends. I am grateful that you do not miss any opportunity to greet and inform me, as you have kindly written through Westerburg of Cologne.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Indeed, most excellent man, the Lord has cast me into bed three times this winter and afflicted me with the prevailing illness, so that around Christmas (Weihnachten), having written my will, I thought of nothing but death. Friends and neighbors standing around comforted my wife with patience alone. However, the merciful Lord, in His mercy, prolonged my misery through the prayers of the pious. May He grant that this old life may serve the benefit of His church. I am not yet restored to full health, which indeed I do not expect.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Nevertheless, I go to the church and not only ascend the pulpit, but I sit on the steps of the choir and remain in the semicircle, from where I proclaim the will of the Lord entrusted to me. I do eat and drink, yet without appetite. I feel myself admonished by the Lord and have received the message of death. Yet I hope for better things if summer returns, as I am most impatient with the cold. I pray that you may pray for me, that He may strengthen me for the benefit of His church.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Here, the fanatical Anabaptist opinion is growing stronger and has infected the best men, the rulers, and the nobles of the region, and they have received an edict from their prophet not to listen to us nor to visit the churches. The elders bear this, and as far as I can tell, they would like us all expelled, so that they are not accused and their greed is not revealed. This can be expressed in a ringing speech.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>I believe you have received from Samuel, a young man of excellent hope, what he has seen and heard among us. I was compelled, due to the absence of my colleague, to preach twice before lunch. I dealt with the man and Gerard to the best of our ability. I wrote to the ministers extemporaneously. I hope they have taken well what was written with a simple mind. Now, through you and Rudolf, I would like to wish all the ministers good health, as I have neither the time nor the strength.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I grieve for the church deprived of its pastor Megander; but the Most High created us mortals and guests in the world. It should be impressed upon the heart that we must depart from here at the Lord's command, and thanks should be given for the convenience of the lodging.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Here, it is rumored, though uncertain, that Martin Luther has passed away. If this is true, I would hope for peace, if not for some who, having sworn by the words of their master, desire victory more than truth. I beseech you by Christ, the only mediator, if it should happen that you must descend into the arena again, do not forget Christian modesty. Christ does not want us to win either in our innocence and the purity of our cause, nor in the blindness of our adversaries, but to trust in Him. He always defends His cause and will defend it. In the fear of the Lord, the reason for our hope must be given; yet victory is in the hand of the Lord. You know, most candid of men, that stubborn heretics have never been defeated by human industry, but by prayer, true fasting not carnal but spiritual, when man does his duty and brings the increase acceptable to the Lord. I know you will take my rough admonition well, as you know the heart from which it proceeds.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell and commend me to God in your prayers. The day after the Annunciation of Mary in the year 46.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Your Hermann Aquilomontanus, in poor health, minister of the Church of the House of the Oldersum.</p>
      <p>Martin Bucer, in a lengthy letter to the most reverend Johannes a Lasco, a man truly noble and endowed with heavenly doctrine, has attempted to defend his inconsistency and Luther's opinion. To which the Lord responded with innate gentleness. I am amazed at the inconstancy of men; but we wish to conquer and boast, not to be taught, as if everything had been handed over to us and the truth occupied by us.</p>
      <p>Farewell and pray for me.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful and sincere minister of the word of God, Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Church of Zurich, his teacher.</p>
