      <p>S. I do not know if M. Heinrich, who delivers this, is known to you; if he is known, he will not need this my recommendation; for he will sufficiently commend himself by his manners and learning. If he is not, I will briefly say. I have heard one Latin author from my teachers throughout my life, Persius, and he lectured this to me. Therefore, I have known him for many years, although in the meantime, while he preached the gospel among the Swabians, I was completely ignorant of him. Now, while he comes forth again teaching, so that all things may be in the Lord's affairs among his own, I could not persuade him to return to them, but rather to seek a place among you, where he might expect the end of the life that remains. And indeed I have persuaded him; for he will attempt this, provided you show yourself to him in such a way that he can conceive some hope. He was once learned, now I think he has grown as much as he has advanced in sound doctrine. Therefore, I assert nothing else about him than that he is a truthful and constant man; what he has promised, he will fulfill in good faith. Therefore, have him commended in my name, but more so in the name of God.</p>
      <p>We all wish to know about the people of Constance; I have received from the letters of someone that they too are thought to be about to receive assistance. If this happens, there will be no people in Germany, even up to the Swiss, who will not be content with one head and one set of laws. These things are from Augsburg, and likewise this: "A booklet has been written by order of the Emperor and the King, which contains articles to be observed until the definition of the council." Among these, three are written, sound and whole, about justification, the true use of the sacraments, and the marriage of priests, which is why the Brandenburgers and the Palatinate received the offered booklet, reasoning thus: with the article on justification remaining, the rest, which are from the papal dregs, cannot but fall with time. They also tried to bring some learned men here to receive it, but in vain; for they argued that the matter pertains to the churches, and thus ceased from persuading. The same was offered to the ecclesiastics; but they rejected it, and that because of the articles already mentioned. Therefore, the Emperor severely rebuked them; but I do not hear that they have been driven from their purpose because of it.</p>
      <p>The people of Maurice also refused, as did John, the Margrave of Brandenburg, the brother of the elector. Therefore, it is thought that the Emperor will impose the booklet on all of Germany by edict until, as I said, the definition of a just council. So much has been done in Augsburg in the concord of religion. What, I ask, my Bullinger, do you think will happen? It seems to me that the nine Cantons, who stand with the Pope, will move entirely at the Emperor's motion.</p>
      <p>What then will happen to us, except what has always happened to the true worshipers of God? May the Lord grant us constancy in Himself.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Greet D. Gwalther for me. Basel, May 8, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned D. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable brother in the Lord. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
