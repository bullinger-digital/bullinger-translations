      <p> Greetings. Although my wife is still very ill and is gravely bedridden with a fever, as I believe, and some of the children as well, so that I do not know when I will be able to set out to you, as I have always intended, since, however, from the information of Mr. Butler, the Englishman, who delivered this, I learned that Mr. Froschauer will accommodate the house he had destined for me to others unless I come to you sooner, it seemed right to implore your kindness, dearest of men, to ensure that the said lodging is reserved for my arrival. For I will come with my family and will avail myself of the grace and goodwill of your most honorable council, which I acknowledge and embrace as having been obtained through your efforts, beloved brothers in the Lord, not doubting that the Lord will most graciously take care of what remains according to His providence. </p>
      <p> Moreover, what is being spread here about the affairs of Saxony, you may perhaps have already learned from the letters of Mr. Vadianus. Would that the Lord would awaken and in some way at least consider the malice of wicked men and visit it as an example. </p>
      <p> Farewell excellently. Greetings to your wife, children, brothers, and all friends. St. Gallen, 25 August 1548. </p>
      <p> Wolfgang Musculus, yours in the Lord. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, dearest lord and brother in Christ. </p>
