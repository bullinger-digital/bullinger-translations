    <p xml:id="regest1">Bucer provided a satisfactory explanation during his visit to Konstanz regarding the opinions [obtained by Chelius]; Bucer and Philipp [Melanchthon] are writing to France to warn [Johannes] Sturm, Chelius, and others against a misuse of the opinions by the French king. In Augsburg, Bucer has won over the pastors to his view of the Lord's Supper. Alexander [Schmutz], a pastor on a benefice of the evangelically-minded letter carrier [Heinrich von Ulm], is to be enticed to move to Strasbourg; a letter from Bullinger could help persuade him otherwise. The messenger will seek assistance for a prisoner in Meersburg.</p>

      <p>To the most beloved brothers, Heinrich Bullinger and Konrad Pellikan.</p>
      <p>Greetings through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Bucer was with us, dearest men, with whom we conversed most freely. He revealed himself in such a way that we are almost appeased. The conclusion of the discussion was this: the plans remain and are slippery and inconsistent, but the interpretation is quite fair. And so the matter stands: If he had given the interpretation he now makes as advice to the Frenchman, we would not have been moved. But since what is done cannot be undone, he is now sending letters with Philipp to France, in which he is quite clear and warns Sturm, Chelius, or any others not to mislead the given advice from what they themselves have understood; for there is now a rumor in Germany that the French king is using these plans to destroy the pious, and thus it is feared that the Frenchman acts as the pope's agent, not sincerely seeking Christ, with the rest, with whom they testify at length that they will never admit anything that cannot be judged by all good men to be in the interest of Christ. If you were to read the letters they send to France, you would desire nothing in them, I am sure. Perhaps our admonition achieved this very thing. You have the gist of the matter. Besides this, I have nothing to write on this matter.</p>
      <p>As for what Bucer did in Augsburg, I hear nothing else than that he has drawn the brothers to his opinion, which he wrote to the MÃ¼nsterites, especially concerning the exhibition of the body of Christ. More on this in the next letters.</p>
      <p>For now, my relative here, a worthy man whom you should love, since he sincerely loves and cherishes the gospel of Christ and alone in Thurgau abstains from the abomination of the papal mass, has left. He has a parishioner named Alexander, a learned man in letters and languages, whom some from Strasbourg are perhaps enticing to leave the church and move to Strasbourg. I have solemnly urged the man by all sacred things not to change his place, but I do not know if he will obey. Therefore, I wish you, Bullinger, would write two or three words to me as if you had heard from elsewhere what he intends, and ask that I delay his departure as much as I can. Perhaps persuaded by your authority, he would change his mind, not his place.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the bearer of this letter will remind you, Bullinger, of a certain good man who is held in chains in Meersburg; may some good advice occur to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your households.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, May 29, 1535.</p>
      <p>Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To the most pious Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, teaching Christ in a Christian manner, to be respected as a brother.</p>
