      <p>Laurentius Normandius, a very faithful friend of our pastor Johannes Calvin, not only a common friend but also a very necessary one, when he recently discussed with me about his journey to you, mentioned you, how he was received not only courteously but also very politely by you and your fellow ministers, so that you have always been rightly considered the most hospitable and friendly to our people. When I inquired of him what work you currently had in hand or what subject you were dealing with (for it is a well-known and proven fact that you are engaged in daily commentaries from the studies you publish), he replied that you had undertaken a difficult, indeed hitherto unattempted work, namely to publish not only a brief explanation but also full commentaries on those obscure [Greek] oracles. From this, I derived great pleasure in my mind, not so much in my own name as in the name of the entire Church of Christ, to which the fruits of your labors and vigils primarily belong, and I began to inquire from him how soon he hoped that your most eagerly awaited work would come to light. "Indeed," he said, "I have long intended to write to Lord Bullinger about this matter, so that if he should wish to entrust this book of his to the press, he might send it to me, and I would ensure that it is published with the utmost diligence and in elegant characters. Therefore, Conrad, if you think it should be done, you can write to him in the name of both of us, asking him to send us those commentaries of his, and we will ensure that neither expense nor diligence is spared, so that they come out most accurately and polished, besides the intention to translate them from Latin into our language, so that our people may also enjoy such a great and excellent good." Thus, I have not unwillingly undertaken this task entrusted to me. If it seems to you that I have acted too freely, indeed audaciously, I ask for pardon; for even if I do not obtain what I wish, I will consider that I have achieved enough with this my brief and inelegant letter, if I have come to the notice of such a great man, whom all the pious ought rightly to honor and revere both for his learning and piety. Farewell in Christ, most excellent man.</p>
      <p>Geneva, 14th day before the calends of May 1557.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Conrad Badius, son of Jodocus Badius Ascensius.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
      <p>Badius requests the Apocalypse.</p>
