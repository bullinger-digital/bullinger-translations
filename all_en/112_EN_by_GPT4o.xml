      <p>Greetings through Christ Jesus, our only savior.</p>
      <p>I sent a letter to you, most excellent Bullinger, via a certain merchant before the first of April, which I do not doubt you have received. Now, having found a messenger to you, I did not want to send him away empty-handed, especially since in the meantime things have happened that compel me to trouble you with my letters. I remember, and I have at hand your letter, in which you conveyed to me your prediction about what seemed to be decided and defined regarding religion in the Augsburg colloquy. The outcome indeed showed you to be a true prophet (which is a certain rule for testing prophets); for you said that those whose minds were inclined towards a certain mixture beforehand would hand over the prepared matter into the hands of the Emperor, who, like a potter, would shape it either broadly or narrowly and propose it to be preserved and retained by all. I hear that this has indeed happened and that Bucer himself has returned home; however, I wish to receive something more certain from you, for I have only received this by rumor and hearsay.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we have received from reliable messengers that great tragedies were enacted in Bern in recent days concerning the matter of the Lord's Supper between Viret first and Zebedee and some others, the outcome of which was that Sulzer, Beatus, and Conrad were ordered by the magistrate to leave, which Sulzer himself wrote to his friends here for the reason that they might prepare a place for him here. Viret and his associates were called to Bern to hear the magistrate's decision; however, what it was, I still do not know. From this, you also see, my Bullinger, that what I once wrote to you about Viret, that he had subscribed to Bucer, I spoke the truth. I have nothing else new except that the Scots have renewed the war against England with the forces of France; I received this yesterday from an Italian merchant who came directly from England. Everyone in England is in a state of alarm, foreign merchants are leaving, and the cause of religion is not in the best place there. The Lord must be prayed to, that He may restore peace to the churches and remove us from dissensions and protect us from enemies. Farewell, my most excellent brother, and greet your family in our name.</p>
      <p>Basel, 6th of May, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Celio.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and vigilant pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich, his singular brother and friend.</p>
