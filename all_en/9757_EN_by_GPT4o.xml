      <p>S. Although our sins are so great and unbelievable, and such godless behavior has been carried on for a long time, God has justly visited us with this miserable scourge of this unnoticed blaze, so that more than half the city was consumed in an hour and on the second day thereafter miserably destroyed by fire. On July 23, between one and two o'clock, it started behind the Kaufhaus (merchant house) next to the inn "Zum Goldenen Storch" (The Golden Stork). There stood a small black house, in which there was a chicken coop and next to it a hay barn, belonging to the aforementioned inn. There, a young woman, instructed by her mistress, was to burn the chicken lice, as the soldiers had to be well treated, and the chickens and roosters were badly infested with lice, etc.</p>
      <p>The young woman (as the common saying goes) quickly fetched a brand from the inn and, with a straw broom, intended to burn the vermin. The flames, caught by the wind, struck the adjacent hay barn and quickly set the inn on fire, which worked in such a way that the sparks, carried by the wind, reached all the other roofs within an hour, immediately catching fire, not from above (as usually happens), but spreading around and thus raging from one roof to another. Everyone ran to the first damage, while many already saw their roofs in red flames before they could reach their houses; which was a reason that many ventured into the fire to save something, many went into the cellars, thinking to save themselves there, only to suffocate, drown, burn, and miserably perish.</p>
      <p>Thirteen of these people were found and buried. Most of the people could not save a scrap, who, with wife and child, have fallen from great wealth into miserable poverty, now miserably and wretchedly wandering around the hedges and fences, and others, who were previously poor people next to them, begging for one thing and another for God's sake. The common buildings that burned are: the hospital, the Dominican monastery, where school was held; the churches that were used, and the armory were not damaged, although the fire raged there for a long time. The watchmen, who were well acquainted with the number of houses, say that within the city walls alone, more than 20 houses, more than half the city, burned down. All the houses, barns, and everything that stood in front of the Upper Gate, up to a barn and house, are gone. When a storm was let loose, the nearest country people from Ems, Schalkvik, Cicers, Ygis, Malans, etc., bravely stood by, with whose help God graciously intervened.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, since every citizen has to do with his lodging, everyone can well imagine how frightened and unprepared people have been for defense. But the need was so quick and great that neither courage nor help could do anything, and in many places, they had to let it burn out. The tower or kitchen, in which the gunpowder lay, God miraculously protected, so that, although the doors were already reached, no damage occurred; for here the city's carpenter ventured over and inside, skillfully sprayed water on the doors, which, being wooden inside, were covered and overlaid with iron outside, and the woodwork burned. Many suspect arson from this. But whoever has seen where and how it started and how the wind quickly spread it here and there, cannot blame the arsonists much, but must cry out that it is a special vengeance and punishment of God. People are already shouting: this is what one gets from preachers; but the fire started right next to the inn, where many of the current officials for the new war were lodged, showing their wealth and splendor, and on that very Friday, when it started, there was drumming, piping, flag-making, shooting, and flying day and night. In short: all madness was not absent, which could have been endured patiently. Although it was strictly forbidden beforehand, one can, when the ambassadors come, well dispense and invite God's vengeance upon oneself. Some houses, especially those closest to the church and parsonage, burned with much wonder for much longer and from evening on, then the whole night until morning, in such a way that the sparks flew far over the church tower to St. Martin, and although it was already extinguished elsewhere, it would not end there.</p>
      <p>So that God, who is gracious and merciful, in the midst of punishment, may show His grace and power, since nothing happened to the temple and other surrounding houses. At the court, they also expected nothing else and therefore threw off most of the roofs, etc. From each community of the nearest neighbors, six men were kept, who, together with other still upright citizens, have care; for always something gladly shows itself here and there and takes away our sleep, etc. So much in haste. May God be gracious to us and protect us well from greater heartache, also awaken the hearts of faithful people, that they may be moved with compassion and mercy towards us poor ruined people, show grace and help, and be willing to share. Amen. 1574, July 26.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, primary and most vigilant bishop of the church in Zurich, his singularly esteemed lord. Zurich.</p>
      <p>On July 23, the city of Chur burned miserably in 1574.</p>
