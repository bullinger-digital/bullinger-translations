    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Greetings! It is not enough that Heinrich sends his brother Johannes [wine] to drink! He must also provide him with food! Everything has [arrived] well. Johannes and especially his "soup maker" [his wife Margaretha, née Berker] thank him heartily for it. As soon as a good opportunity for transport arises, the latter plans to reciprocate with a New Year's gift intended for Heinrich's children. The poultry that Heinrich will receive as a New Year's gift has not yet been slaughtered. For the sister-in-law Anna [née Adlischwyler], the [enclosed] coin is intended as a New Year's gift. Johannes and his wife wish Heinrich and his family a happy new year - a wish that, in view of Heinrich's letter [not received], can be well used. But let us wait. God will not abandon the righteous. At least one should show strength in the fight against the devil's schemes!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] As for Johannes, there is almost no change to report. On Wednesday, he arrived home at half-past three. The next day he felt a little better, even though he was still very tired.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Today [Saturday] he preached in Maschwanden.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] On Friday, he received only a surety for 17 pounds and 4 batzen. He would have almost preferred to lease the tithe. No matter how, it will not prove rewarding for him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] He suspects that Heinrich will send him a barrel of "Capperer" [wine]. In return, Johannes will send him a barrel of "Murner" [wine]. Heinrich should compare both.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Enough! God's blessing!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Johannes forgot [on Wednesday] to give Heinrich the money for the wine transport. Enclosed are the corresponding 5 guilders.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Given on Saturday.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] From Heinrich's informative letter, Johannes will believe what seems probable to him.</p>

      <p>Greetings from Christ, etc. It is not enough that you give me something to drink, you must also give me something to eat! Everything is good together. Therefore, I, and especially my soup maker, thank you all. She will also hold herself nobly and honestly with the children with her New Year's gift, as soon as we find and provide for it. Your New Year's gift, which you are expecting from me, is still not ready. Give the sister the thick one as a sign of a good blessed year, which my wife and I also wish for you all, as we need it according to your letter. Let it go! I have not seen the righteous forsaken. At least let us be strong in the battle against all the devil's assaults, etc.</p>
