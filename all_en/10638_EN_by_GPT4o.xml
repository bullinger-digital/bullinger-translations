      <p>For you alone. For you alone.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I must inform you of my distress as my most trusted brother. I have written to you more often about my hernia, although I have suffered little pain as long as I have had it. However, it has continued to grow, which neither Mr. Fritz, blessed, nor Master Jacob, blessed, nor Master Rudolf could prevent. Now it has come to the point where I am very concerned that I will no longer be able to continue preaching in the church, as I have suffered a severe backache for 14 days, followed by 14 days of terrible cutting and cramping throughout my viscera and intestines, so that I expected death, and the hernia grew so much that it almost resembles the size of my head, although it has now subsided and diminished after the illness. They also had to widen the entrance to the pulpit for me, so all my distress has come to the council's attention, which, as I was told, greatly shocked our lords and made them consider lightening my burden somewhat. For God knows well my toil and labor, which I have borne beyond my body's capacity and have allowed myself to be used up to the utmost.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, since Franz can no longer preach in any church, I am now on the way, having been sent by my lords for the first time, but before all illness, and they want to know from me whom I would advise them to appoint as a preacher. Caspar and I had agreed to represent Franz until autumn, and it remained so at that time. But now that I have fallen so much, they have also sent for Caspar, asked him the same opinion, and he did not want to give an answer but took it upon himself to consult with me and answer the council in the morning. So Caspar and I have agreed to present Rellicanus, who is pious and learned enough, if now the discussion in our great church were sufficient (although here I fear that what was previously from one may now happen as desired).</p>
      <p>Then we presented one in the Niedersimmental, Peter Kunz, also known as Cunz, who is not unskilled, of great reputation, well-connected and known, well-spoken, 10,000 pounds rich, who was sent with me to the disputation in Baden, and he will now preach here the other week, and his speech will be heard. He was also one of the first among us to be inclined to the gospel, who brought the entire land of Niedersimmental to obedience to the faith before the disputation, and they are still the best, regardless of those in the Obersimmental, who have long been rebellious and pontifical. Thirdly, we presented Master Heinrich Möricker from Schinznach, well known to you. Here, in the presence of the senate, Caspar added Master Johannes Buchser in Sur. Now you will pray to God with the church that He may provide those who are most suitable for His glory and the salvation of the church. I have understood well that they will not expect more than two sermons from me, one on Sunday, the other during the week, and to provide other help to the church.</p>
      <p>I ask you, my brother, to inquire with your doctors what diet I should have. Not only have the intestines fallen into the sac, but also the fat from the navel, and what brings flatulence, but I do not really know what that is, it causes me pain. I fear I may no longer be able to ride or go anywhere, so I will never see my Bullinger again. Therefore, do not hesitate to comfort me with your friendly writing. Let me know the answer to all things. I can no longer write now.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and if any of your works are in the press, let me know.</p>
      <p>June 24, 1535</p>
      <p>I finished this with tears.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know</p>
      <p>B. H.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his especially kind lord and brother.</p>
