      <p> Greetings. I have a just complaint against your wife, dear and most esteemed man, Myconius. She came to Zürich and, approaching me late, only greeted me. Even though she was invited to dinner, she did not come and left in the morning. Therefore, I did not extend any courtesy to her; indeed, she is at fault. Thus, I complain and interpret her actions as follows: she did not come so that, while I descend to Basel, I myself would not come to you. Furthermore, I have nothing else to write except that there is much talk of Müssius the robber preparing an army and ships, with which, in the name of the Roman king, he might seize Constance, which the Emperor in every way repels from pacification, while those meanwhile persist and favor the Emperor well. I wish those who think that force will not be ungrateful to many are mistaken. I truly hope that neither Müssius the robber nor Madruschius captures Constance. </p>
      <p> I see great evils being amassed for Switzerland from that city. But perhaps fate wills it so. Let us pray to the Lord for the innocent people of Constance, indeed, and for ourselves; our matter is at hand, while the neighbor's wall burns. May the Lord preserve His church. </p>
      <p> Farewell. I could not write more; I await yours. May all good men and your wife be safe. October 13, 1548. I know that our Frisius is commended to you. </p>
      <p> Yours, Heinrich Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the esteemed Oswald Myconius, his brother. Basel. </p>
