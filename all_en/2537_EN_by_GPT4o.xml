      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ the Savior.</p>
      <p>Your letters have been most welcome to us, as have all those sent to us so far, especially since, in your kindness, you wished to inform us of what seemed appropriate to you in giving a response to Mr. Calvin. We certainly know that we are not sworn to your words: we also know how much the dissension and variety of opinions among churches of the same profession can hinder: we also know how much consensus can achieve, even in external matters, and how much more in spiritual ones. We are most grateful to you for this. For how much we have progressed so far, both in receiving and giving advice, and in preserving harmony and consensus, cannot be expressed. For under your authority, we also protect our own, even though it is nothing. From there, we see an uncommon benefit accruing to our church.</p>
      <p>We write to Calvin that we give thanks to God the Father for providing us with mouth and wisdom, as we are not only led but also brought before kings and princes, both pious and impious.</p>
      <p>We acknowledge the divine providence that has given such defenders to our churches, who protect their cause against adversaries who slander them as being corrupters of the sacraments, impiously thinking about God, Christ, ministry, word, and sacraments. We see that it was not without divine providence that your consensus with Calvin, previously quite succinct, has now come out into the world somewhat more openly, yet so instructed that we are persuaded that every opportunity for greater slander has been taken from the adversaries, and such a sign of union has been given to ours that it cannot be shaken in any way. We would have preferred the writing of that Saxon to be attached, not because we doubt Calvin's faith, but because a freer access would have been made to Calvin's writing against the Saxons, from whose churches our writings have so far been exiled. We pray that he continues to handle the cause of our churches, indeed of Christ, with such modesty. We promise our efforts, and if we cannot provide them in writing, we will not fail him with generous support and earnest prayer to God.</p>
      <p>We wanted you to know this, dearest Bullinger: if you see any error in our consultation, please advise, and we will heed the advisor: for it will be welcome. We will also correct any error that may have arisen not from malice but rather from ignorance (which we do not yet see).</p>
      <p>We have nothing new except that we cannot sufficiently marvel at the divine providence in protecting the faithful. Our lords, the Bernese and the Baselers, have handled the cause of the Locarno brothers with their advice in such a way that their adversaries are satisfied with their exile, who were said to thirst for their blood.</p>
      <p>Your most honorable council has decreed that if that precipitous occasion presents itself, the brothers and their affairs can be conveniently consulted, with the Christian name's confession preserved and unharmed. Oh, the poor Landfrieden! Moreover, we pray that you share with us the entire Locarno affair and the propositions of your most honorable council, as well as the acts both in the city and in the countryside.</p>
      <p>They will be described very quickly without any harm to you. We expect from you the news you have, both from England and from other matters, which will be of interest for us to know.</p>
      <p>My fellow ministers greet you: we also wish you all, most humane brothers, to be safe. Farewell and live long for us and the church of Christ. Schaffhausen, January 28, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in doctrine, candor, and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, brother and lord to be respected. Zürich.</p>
