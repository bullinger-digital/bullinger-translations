      <p>S. D. I give the greatest thanks to your kindness, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother, for the faithful and abundant exposition of French affairs. I will use it to support the truth.</p>
      <p>As for the boys, we will ensure that they are disciplined and that their needs are carefully considered in all respects. In return, we commend to you our boys who are now coming to you, especially the brother of Johannes Herter. Herter is a deputy in our literary school of Lord Frisius and is related to me by marriage, a man certainly pious and diligent.</p>
      <p>He also wished to see the school and church of Geneva; therefore, I commend him to you. The king had requested that 1000 Swiss be sent to him, who would be bodyguards in those disturbances. However, now the envoy Mr. Coignet is not pressing much, nor is Fr√∂lich raising soldiers. They say the disturbances in France have subsided, and the King of Navarre is expected in Paris, and peace is hoped for, and that everything will be happily settled. Would that everything be settled according to the will of God, not according to the judgment and schemes of corrupt men. Here we are uncertain whether we have peace or war.</p>
      <p>The Diet of Einsiedeln has ended.</p>
      <p>Nothing has been accomplished.</p>
      <p>The Five Cantons demand that the Evangelicals of Claron return to the old faith (as they say) from the new. If they do not do this, there is doubt about what the lords and communities (as they call them) will attempt. The others, such as the people of Zurich, Bern, Basel, Fribourg, Solothurn, Schaffhausen, Appenzell, and the Grisons, have seriously enjoined the Five Cantons to act by law, not by force or arms, and to settle their disputes and cause.</p>
      <p>What will happen, the Lord knows.</p>
      <p>For they are becoming fierce and incredibly insolent.</p>
      <p>May the Lord either convert them or restrain them! The inspiration of the pope, whose envoy they support, is at work in them. I ask you to diligently expedite what you see written on the paper and respond to me.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you and yours. October 10, 1560.</p>
      <p>May our Beza be safe.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
