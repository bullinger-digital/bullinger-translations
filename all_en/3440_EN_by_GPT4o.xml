      <p>S. P. Since I have nothing, Bullinger, father and teacher to be preserved, neither before nor dearer, than to return to you most instructed in all disciplines and especially, as far as both the study of medicine is concerned, therefore I diligently apply all the powers and efforts of my mind and thoughts, by which this may be conveniently done. I also received with the greatest joy from the letters of my father about my granted journey to Italy, that you, with your utmost benevolence and humanity towards me, wish and strive for the same in every way.</p>
      <p>For this desire towards me, I give you great thanks and will always give thanks, and certainly with this effort of yours, you will achieve that I not only satisfy myself, but please you more, which you uniquely desire, and be grateful and accepted. For I am not ignorant or of such dull and blunt mind, that I do not know what it is to neglect opportunities and conveniences of studying. But that I have not delayed the promotion and the dignity of doctor any longer or postponed it to Italy (for now I think it has reached your ears that I have been promoted in both faculties of medicine and physics), I have undertaken, persuaded by many reasons and honestly, that it can be done. For besides that you wished doctors to come forth from Gaul and Italy, I have been persuaded and urged by all the conditions proposed by you regarding religion, school, examinations, and the remaining promotion in both faculties, and relying on the advice of the teachers, especially of Mr. Fontanon and Rondellet, to whom you have recommended me (who certainly would have promoted me in Montpellier, if expenses had not been an impediment).</p>
      <p>Indeed, the name of doctor contributes greatly to practicing medicine first, since I hear from most that it is scarcely allowed to the unpromoted, then to gaining the trust of the sick, as experience itself shows. Therefore, you have now received the causes and reasons for the promotion.</p>
      <p>But why I have set out to the most illustrious baron for practice, you will understand from my brother, if necessary; however, I think I have done nothing without reason or unadvisedly. I now send to you the testimony of my studies in Montpellier, but I will send the practice of my most illustrious prince later, when he returns from a certain legation. Mr. Anton Schneeberger, who recently moved to us, with whom I live both familiarly and amicably and join common studies, sends his most dutiful greetings to you and your family. Given in Montpellier, December 19, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted and observant Caspar Wolf with my own hand. To the most illustrious and vigilant Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of ZÃ¼rich, most revered father and lord.</p>
