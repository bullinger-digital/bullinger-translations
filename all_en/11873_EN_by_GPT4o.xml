    <p xml:id="regest1">Regrets that he cannot keep up with Bullinger's diligent transmission of news; thanks for forwarding the letter from the [Swiss] troops [about the capitulation of Mondovì?]. Rumors about the death of the Emperor [Charles V], possibly due to epilepsy, and the end of the siege [of Landrecies?]; requests further exchange of information. He cannot report anything certain about [Sultan Suleiman I], but wishes that the Emperor and [King Francis I] would turn against him instead of against Christians; for [the Protestants], a victory of the Emperor would be particularly dangerous; may God assist us! Luther's letter to [Christoph Froschauer] distresses him greatly, but he hopes Luther will not start a public polemic, and also asks Bullinger to refrain from doing so. He should also not react to the foolishness of [Johannes] Cochläus [“De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae autoritate”], also to avoid provoking Luther. Questionable motives behind a prince's desire to join [the Schmalkaldic League]. Bucer praises Bullinger in a letter to Blarer and admits that Luther is quick-tempered; Philipp [Melanchthon] and others are doing their best to counteract those who provoke him. Additionally, Bucer reports on the fruitless siege of Landrecies by the Emperor. One should hope for God's assistance in a time when Germany is in a worse state than many assume; Bullinger should pray. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. It truly grieves me somewhat, my venerable and most delightful Bullinger, that you now surpass me so much in your faith and diligence in writing, and I will not allow you to remain the victor here for long, unless all opportunities for victory completely abandon me. My friends are persistently silent, especially regarding the outcomes of wars. Therefore, I am exceedingly grateful to you for sending the letter from your soldiers, which you receive back here.</p>
      <p>What the French general (as they call him) ambassador revealed about the Emperor, I fear may not be true; but I rather subscribe to your opinion, although there are those who think that the Emperor, tormented by the Herculean disease, which has often and for a long time afflicted him, has given the occasion for abandoning the siege. Whatever you hear further about these matters, write diligently at the first opportunity, which I solemnly promise to do in return.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Turk, where he is now, what he is doing or attempting, nothing certain is written to us. Would that the Emperor and the French, with united forces, would turn the entire force of war against this most monstrous enemy at once, and not themselves proceed to be more monstrous than the Turk in Christian blood! It would be difficult to judge whose victory, the Emperor's or the French's, should seem more praiseworthy to the Christian world, except that to us, I say to us, the Emperor's victory seems not undeservedly to bring with it a great train of evils. May the God of peace so moderate this uncertain game of war that, wherever it falls, it may fall with the least possible shedding of Christian blood and even less loss to the gospel and the kingdom of Christ.</p>
      <p>What you wrote about Luther's letter to your printer has distressed me beyond measure, as nothing has in many years, except that I hope he will not write anything more bitter publicly against you, as he would gravely sin against God and the peace of the church if he did. I beseech you by Jesus Christ and by His blood, by which all things are reconciled, to steadfastly overlook this with Christian tolerance, and that only until he provokes you first with a published accusation. Certainly, the wounds received from the previous unfortunate conflict are still poorly healed, so it is not fitting to accumulate evil upon evil with new inflictions. But I know the modesty of your spirit and that you will voluntarily pursue the things of peace. Your church is truly set upon a mountain and rests on a firmer foundation than to be shaken by such bulls; its ministers have been and are more illustrious than to be obscured by any affected calumnies. The day of the Lord, which is at the door, will reveal all things.</p>
      <p>If you listen to me, you will not respond at all to the foolishness of Cochläus, lest Luther also be more irritated by this, not to mention that otherwise, you would seem to achieve no worthwhile result, even if you respond well to a man occupied with more sacred matters. Time is a most precious expenditure, which we should agree to acquire in all things and to place in the best use.</p>
      <p>As for that prince you write about, I will say once, he is neither strong in resources nor in virtue, so that the confederates of the gospel might think he wanted to join them for this one reason, to have those on whose help he could rely, nor does he seriously seek the Lord, and I wish these things were false, which, however, not at all vain men testify about him.</p>
      <p>Now letters are brought from Bucer, in which among other things he writes: "About Bullinger, it is as you write; he is a man not of a quarrelsome nature and faithful in ministry, to whom no one does not grant much, who simply looks to the edification of the churches and judges about the brothers not without the suffrage of charity. Luther is too severe, whom I know, however, to regard God with his whole heart; but inept and harmful whisperers have also previously caused many disturbances with him. Philip with many others counter the storms they raise as much as they can; but they cannot as much as they wish." These things to you.</p>
      <p>About the Emperor, he writes thus: "The Emperor is still sitting at Landrecies, a most fortified little town, which the French of Brabant took this summer and still hold. The camps of both armies are not more than two miles apart from each other; an immense amount of money is wasted on both sides in vain, and soldiers are lost in abundance. Thus the Lord breaks us and prepares us for the Turks." Let us pray to the Lord with humble hearts, my Bullinger, that He may never allow us to be tempted by these evils beyond the strength which He will supply, but by the strength of His arm either deliver us completely or help us so that we may be able to bear it. The common affairs of our Germany are in a much worse state than many understand. Almost all are stunned by all these things with a certain unfortunate security and do not think whether they can meet him with ten thousand who comes against them with twenty thousand, so that they might send a timely embassy to seek the things of peace, and thus one after another we are miserably destroyed, nor does anything shine forth anywhere from which it is permissible to hope for better things, both for the monarchs and the remaining magistracy with the people, and I wish not also for many ministers of the gospel of Jesus Christ daily falling into worse. But He, who even raises the dead and calls those things which are not as though they were, without any trouble, when it seems good to Him, will transform all things into a better and more worthy form. Supported by this hope, we do not entirely lose heart. Pray diligently for us, that we may properly fulfill our duty and prove ourselves rightly to Him who has entrusted this to us.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you. In my turn, greet your whole household, Mr. Consul Rösti and his son with his wife. You will greet our Gwalther, a singular and excellent friend, many times and lovingly. Farewell well, my always venerable and dearest brother in the Lord, a good part of my soul.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, December 12, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours, Amb. Bl.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
