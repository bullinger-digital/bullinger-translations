      <p>Greetings. Recently, through your Gessner, I sent your notes on the confession of Farel and Beza. Now, through this man of proven faith and my godfather, indeed one of yours but also our citizen, I am also sending letters, for which I am very grateful to you. I already knew beforehand that the colloquium would not proceed in the manner some were dreaming of. May the Lord himself, the Prince of Peace, soon resolve the most difficult matters of his church to the glory of his name. Greet your household in my name along with the most holy brothers and friends; ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Let me know what has been decided by yours against those who have gone to the military service for the second and third time. I learned late that they would leave, although we have received nothing entirely new.</p>
      <p>The common soldiers and some large Hansens (a term for mercenaries) are carrying much and great goods through here, which have been robbed and plundered at Calais. But soon, I know, they will vomit up what they have swallowed with such cruel voracity into a stomach that digests poorly. Oh, how bitterly they will find it to spew it out and how it will turn their hearts! Given in great haste on the 10th of March in the year 1558. There were noble youths from Cleves here, who affirm that Peter Paul Vergerius is again contemplating defection from us to the papists; but may Christ have better plans for him!</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
