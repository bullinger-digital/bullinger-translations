      <p>Greetings. I have given this courier Calvin's letters to you, which he sent to me here so that I might ensure their delivery to you. Since I believe that he has abundantly informed you about our affairs, both through his letters and through the recent conversation he had with you in Zürich, and because I am writing quite lengthy and burdensome letters on the same matter to Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, an old friend and someone very fond of me, I did not think it worthwhile to trouble you repeatedly with the same matters.</p>
      <p>Since, besides the fact that I reluctantly handle this matter, in which I am compelled to reveal the disgrace of those whom I would rather praise to the heavens, it also happens that if there is anything in my long letter that you should know, I do not doubt that Mr. Gwalther will share it with you in confidence, especially since I am not unaware of the friendship and connection between you. If anything in it seems to you to be said too harshly or severely, I beg you not to be offended: because I am certain that you would have judged all these things to be too mild if you were in the same situation with us, or if the indignity and injustice of the matter, which has been inflicted not only on us but on the whole church by those who should have been primarily concerned with our and the church's welfare, were fully known to you. But since it has seemed good to the Lord to test us in this way, I beseech you and all your colleagues and fellow ministers through Christ Jesus and our common ministry to make an effort to calm these waves stirred up by the importunity and wickedness of some, which are so deadly to us, unless you wish our churches to be exposed to the greatest dangers, especially at this time when no church can find any certain peace anywhere.</p>
      <p>Show yourselves to be what you are, that is, lovers of peace and concord. All of ours send their most respectful greetings to you and your colleagues. When I have more leisure, I will respond more fully to your letters, if the matter requires it, for which I thank you most greatly.</p>
      <p>When they were first delivered to me, I did not quite understand the direction of certain things you were reminding me of. But after I saw these disturbances stirred up among us, I suspected enough that you did not write without reason, and that the work of malevolent people had not been lacking in spreading sinister suspicions about us among you. But time will reveal who have been and still are the more sincere ministers of Christ. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe for His church for a long time.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Lausanne, July 23, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Pierre Viret.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Zürich church, brother and fellow minister, to be greatly respected.</p>
