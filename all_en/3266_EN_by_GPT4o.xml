      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Bullinger, Friedrich von Salis sends greetings.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, I wrote to you through Mr. Peter Perna.</p>
      <p>The news I mentioned then is becoming more confirmed and true by the day.</p>
      <p>In that conflict near Paliano, which I wrote about, Mr. Julius Ursinus, who was in charge of the Pope's cavalry, was captured.</p>
      <p>Now it is said here that Rome is suffering from a severe shortage of grain and wine, and that a large number of people have left the city and moved elsewhere due to the scarcity, so much so that 5542 houses are found empty of owners, which otherwise used to be very full of inhabitants.</p>
      <p>The Pope, fearing some sudden sedition might be stirred up against him by the citizens, since everyone bears this war very unjustly and indeed considers it ruinous to the Roman dominion, having been stirred up by the Pope himself, has sent for the Duke of Guise with many promises, enticing him to come to Rome immediately with his army. It is also requested more earnestly in the name of the Pope from the Duke of Guise, because Marcus Antonius Colonna has been reinforced with 8000 infantry and 1000 cavalry sent to him by the Duke of Alba, and it is believed that Paliano will be captured very soon, after which it is thought that Colonna will move his army to the city, having first joined forces with the Duke of Alba, as some think. Moreover, the Pope asked the Duke of Ferrara to send him 2500 Swiss soldiers quickly, whom he has with him; but the Duke refused to do so, asserting that he needs them for the defense of his duchy, and indeed it seems that some danger is imminent for him; for the Imperial forces are greatly increasing at Correggio and Guastalla, places not far from the territory of Ferrara.</p>
      <p>Add to this that the Marquis of Pescara is recruiting soldiers through the Mantuan territory and is also preparing the military as much as he can, intending to march against Ferrara. The Turkish fleet has landed at Valona, as they say, and is being more abundantly supplied with provisions and all necessities for future navigation; but where it will finally head is unknown. There are indeed those who think it will approach the province of Narbonne and stay there for the winter, while others think it will seek a port at Ancona and other places designated by the Pope for the Duke of Guise, so that the French can use the fleet's help wherever the most Christian King needs it, around those maritime coasts. And indeed, all the aforementioned things, as I have received them, I pass on to you, asking for pardon if they are less true. I, my most esteemed Lord Bullinger, am detained here longer than I would like; but one must yield to the more powerful. Indeed, I am handling a matter that, if it turns out as desired, will be very beneficial to Christian piety, and I am all the more diligently engaged because the matter is religious.</p>
      <p>Nowhere are adversaries lacking, and he who opposes us is always very much like himself, and such are his followers and attendants. However it may be, the Lord God will prevail.</p>
      <p>I do not know when I will extricate myself from this labyrinth; however, I am diligently pressing on so that I may be freed as soon as possible, not without hope of obtaining what I seek. As soon as I return home, I will write to you more extensively about everything.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, take care to be well with your whole family, whom you will greet very much in my name, and also the reverend Mr. Bernardino Ochino, Mr. Peter Martyr, and all your noble lords, Mr. Rudolf Walther and Mr. Frisius, and all other friends you will likewise greet in my name.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Venice, August 9, 1557. Also greet my son, whom I always commend to you and all the pious, etc. Yours as much as ever, the same as always, Friedrich von Salis.</p>
