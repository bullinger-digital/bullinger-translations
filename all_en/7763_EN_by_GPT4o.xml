      <p> Greetings. I truly cannot respond to the reckless imprudence and malice of these men; may the Lord grant them a better mind, so that they do not suffer deserved punishment someday! In the meantime, the Lord will not abandon your church, even if they are ashamed to provide it with support; they are unworthy to do so, but worthy to sell themselves and all their possessions under dominion, etc. What the soldier is said to have written from the royal camp, I send to you transcribed here; believe as much as you like. Otherwise, at present, I have nothing else except what is truly said about the peace negotiations between the king and Condé. Condé wants to have freedom of faith and that it be sworn upon. 2. That all Italians be dismissed from the court and the government be established, as the old kings in France, with Frenchmen. 3. That in cities and fortresses, the king will appoint those he wants and occupy them with his people, yet everything will be under the king's income, and in times of need, the cities and people should serve the king. </p>
      <p> After long deliberations over the truce, Condé has advanced and engaged in a skirmish with the king's brother, where on both sides about 3000 remained dead. If peace is not made now, it is over for France. Condé is said to be strong and well-armed, so that he can endure the situation, etc. - In Strasbourg, the cathedral canons have also elected two bishops; there is discord. And while Aumale is still near Metz with a large force, those in Strasbourg are taking mercenaries, etc., and thus misfortune arises everywhere. May God improve it! May He preserve you and all our brothers! Greet for me Captain Carlin, the mayors, Pontisella, Ganthner, and all good gentlemen and friends. January 28, 1569. </p>
      <p> Yours, etc. H[einrich] B[ullinger]. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, my honorable lord and dearest brother. </p>
      <p> Chur. </p>
