      <p>S. D. I give the greatest thanks, most esteemed father in Christ, for your singular solicitude, which causes you to continually anticipate me with your frequent letters. I strive with all my might to follow your paternal advice and have hitherto also diligently observed it both in the Grubelian matter and in other affairs; nevertheless, the zeal of the Lord's house often consumes me even against my will and resistance, especially when I am forced to see the long thread of scandals and yet am not allowed to break it off with legitimate reason. Meanwhile, I am well aware that the Lord, the just judge, does not slumber, to whom I commend the whole matter and with this consolation I sustain myself as best I can.</p>
      <p>I eagerly await the edition of your Apology, in which you indicate that you are working diligently to complete it; I hope, however, that it will have an acrimony worthy of both your gravity and the goodness of the cause you are advocating, against the most impudent face of the adversary, so that even the simple may see and abhor the baseness of this impostor and sycophant.</p>
      <p>I am very eager to examine the letters received from the Palatinate in due time. Today, by the grace of God, I again appeared in public, explaining the dilemma described by the Apostle Paul in the first chapter to the Philippians, in which I felt myself constrained with the Apostle, not without joy of my spirit. May the Lord do what seems best to Him. It is written that envoys from Basel have come to Prince Cond√© and others from the French nobility to deliberate on peace. It is affirmed that the Cardinal of Lorraine, the plague of France, is dead; it is also written that a rumor has reached that the royal troops have been affected by a disaster, in which our Confederates were also involved, although some still doubt this rumor in such a great liberty of lying. Not poorly, my father, but excellently do you paint for my eyes, indeed I have become so accustomed to your painting that, even if you were to write with your eyes closed, I would confidently read what you had painted. And I write this now at least so that you may know what we are doing.</p>
      <p>The fellow ministers and friends with me send greetings to you and all the brothers. Farewell in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Given on the 2nd of February in the year of our Lord 1575.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Johann Konrad Ulmer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and distinguished servant of Jesus Christ, Lord Heinrich Bullinger the elder, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and father in Christ.</p>
