    <p xml:id="regest1">There is good reason to rejoice over the election of the pastor designated for the Bern Minster! Although the troublemakers [Beat Gering and Simon Sulzer] proposed local candidates to the Great Council (to ensure no one from outside would be chosen) with Bucerian sympathies and praised them in their deceitful manner excessively, we were still able to secure the appointment of the Küsnacht pastor Jodocus Kilchmeyer. Now Bullinger should ensure that there are no delays from Zurich's side!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- What Rümlang learned about Bullinger's conversations with Andreas Rappenstein and Peter Im Haag, he implemented with the other [Bernese Zwinglians]. Thus, in the Council of Two Hundred, the two Zurich candidates were proposed: one from Winterthur [Matthias Hirsgarter?], the other from Küsnacht [Kilchmeyer]. When Rümlang was questioned about the two, he endorsed Kilchmeyer from Lucerne, because he is learned, upright, experienced, and mature. He also has a resonant and loud voice. And so we secured him! [Gering and Sulzer] are, of course, very annoyed about this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Rümlang must soon come to Zurich, as his uncle [...] has died in Winterthur. Bullinger should take care of the further proceedings [until then].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Excellent Bullinger, rejoice that the matter of electing the preacher has turned out as desired! Our troublemakers nominated three Bucerian sympathizers, who are also Bernese, and praised them with wonderful encomiums (songs of praise), albeit deceitfully, to the heavens, urging us not to accept outsiders but locals. However, we did not slumber and secured Mr. Jodocus from Küsnacht. Therefore, ensure that there is no delay or hindrance in the Zurich council!</p>

      <p>Andreas Rappenstein had communicated to me what you discussed with him, along with Hagius; and I then executed these matters with others. In the council of the diocese, two Zurich candidates were nominated, one from Winterthur and the other from Küsnacht. I was asked about the nature of these men. I gave testimony and my vote for Mr. Jodocus, stating that he is learned, upright, honest, experienced, and not recent, but mature in years and character, and endowed with a resonant voice. We secured him. I also mentioned that he is from Lucerne. And although our troublemakers are very displeased! God, however, was gracious to us, whom we had invoked before the votes were cast.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I will come to you shortly, as my uncle in Winterthur has passed away. You will take care of the remaining matters. May God deign to protect us with His grace.</p>

      <p>Greet the entire clergy of Zurich. Farewell, excellent one, with your entire family. Given on the 13th day of September in the year 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant and upright man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of Zurich, his ever-honored patron.</p>
