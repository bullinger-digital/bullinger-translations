      <p>Greetings. You have reproached me, esteemed lord and beloved brother in Christ, along with many others, regarding our response written to you on the matter of Hieronymus. However, since that response was not mine alone but a common one from all of us, there is no reason for me to respond privately now. Nevertheless, I keep your letter to myself, and as far as I can see, this is not an unwise decision. I am very sorry that this question has led to contention, from which I fear more offense than edification will arise. You are not unaware of the articles that the opponents of St. Augustine imposed on him from this dispute. What is happening today is clear to no one.</p>
      <p>That God not only foresaw but predestined and arranged the fall of Adam seems to be of such a nature that the origin of evil and the cause of sin could be reflected back on God as the author. It seems harsh to me to assert that God, having created those destined for destruction, would deprive them of the ability to hear His word, and thus blind them through preaching, and therefore that the universal promises of God and the words of Christ in Matthew 11 and John 3, as well as those of St. Paul in 1 Timothy 2, and finally those of St. Peter in Acts 10, pertain only to a few, and that the term 'permission' should not be accepted in explaining certain passages of Scripture. And it is certain that not a few truth-seeking men are offended by this.</p>
      <p>Since you have long understood this from others, there is no need for me to explain to you at length something you already know.</p>
      <p>Your brother-in-law's son is very impudent and of a stubborn nature, as his father will understand from his guest's letters. He never came to my house, which I had opened to him. I think it would be better for him to be recalled and kept under stricter discipline. I write this late; for until now, we had hoped for his amendment. However, nothing has been done by him except for impudence and negligence.</p>
      <p>Duke Christoph of Württemberg and the theologians of Strasbourg have decided to send their theologians to the council; for the council promises them everything and has postponed the session to be held on January 25 to March 12.</p>
      <p>Wretched are those who believe these deceivers; for even if they return with their lives intact, they will have brought considerable harm to the good cause. But they will also engage with the professed enemies of Christ without any benefit. May the Lord be with His church, which is gravely afflicted by evils from all sides. May the Lord keep you and all yours, whom I bid farewell. Zürich, February 20, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church in Geneva, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Geneva.</p>
