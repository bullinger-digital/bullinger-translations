    <p xml:id="regest1">Has overlooked Luther's criticism of Zwingli [in: "Von den Konziliis und Kirchen"]; recommends a friendly letter that gives Luther the opportunity to comment. Welcomes the rejection of the [Nuremberg?] meeting by [Zurich]. Ambrosius [Blarer] cannot yet assess the prospects of his efforts for the Augsburg church and needs support through prayer. Zwick's requests for Vadian's letter on the glorification of Christ [No. 894] or for the naming of a young man [suitable as an assistant] are still unanswered. What Michael [Back?] from Vienna has written will be communicated by Leo [Jud].</p>

      <p>Greetings. Either I have not read or I have not noticed, dearest Bullinger, the place where Luther criticizes Zwingli. However, care must be taken lest anything be turned back against him. Nevertheless, the teacher should be excused by the student in friendly letters towards Luther, not only for the sake of an excuse, but so that you may hear what he has to say against you or what his attitude is towards you, etc.</p>
      <p>We are glad to hear that your [Zurich] rejected the meeting; for things are as you write.</p>
      <p>Ambrosius [Blarer] neither hopes for anything nor despairs regarding the establishment of the house of God among the people of Augsburg. He has enough conjectures in neither direction; however, he extracts prayers from all of us to the Lord, by which he may be helped in his endeavors.</p>
      <p>You have not replied about Vadian's letter on the glorification of Christ, although you can and should give it to me at his command; for I have obtained it. Nor have you added anything about the young man, although not by sending, but by describing. What Michael [Back?] from Vienna will say to me, Leo [Jud] will tell.</p>
      <p>Farewell. July 22, 1539.</p>
      <p>I wish your entire family well.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, brother and uniquely beloved lord.</p>
