      <p>Greetings and perseverance in the knowledge of Christ.</p>
      <p>What you strive for with all your might, to restore, adorn, and defend the Christian and true piety somewhat shaken by the untimely death of the most blessed man Ulrich Zwingli, you do well and most worthily, dearest Heinrich. May the Lord, who gives growth to all, support, increase, and favor your happy efforts. For he adds great hopes to our minds, since (may it be fortunate and auspicious) you succeed in the place and function of the most famous and equally candid man, yourself destined to be no less famous! You may see dull and foolish men bearing trophies, singing paeans, boasting of triumphs (but according to the proverb, praise before victory), to whom it will be easy and quick to show the ball thrown into their mouth, if you proceed fearlessly, adhere to your undertakings, and with a spirit that, as he says, alone conquers all, you will not unworthily achieve what many promise themselves about you. They promise, moreover, with a certain pious dexterity, that you will overcome the cruel and excessively harsh troubles attacking piety and (lest I conceal what I hope, more impudently) with no less pious integrity, you will alleviate and with support and help, whatever afflictions attack, press, and torment the pious from all sides. Try to fulfill the wishes of all, and you will strive in such a way that I too, from the state of my exile (which present troubles have brought upon me through certain atheists for the most abominable impiety of the mass), may experience and feel your duty in attaining the function. Your most blessed predecessor Zwingli acted in this matter most piously and happily, for which he should be granted an immortal name among posterity. It is necessary that you renew his work and diligence in helping the brothers, even with given effort. I am indeed among those whom they call foreigners. (But how a Christian is alien to a fellow minister of the Gospel, you easily know from the candor of your mind.) And certainly, in this name, I see and experience (for I speak from experience) some not sufficiently pious and therefore inexperienced in fraternal calamities and thus less compassionate, neglecting, despising, and contemning us. With what mind they do this, let it be their concern. Certainly, those whose mind is less sincere and incorrupt, aim to be of use with Christian candor to as many as need it. They need it most (as you know me better), who, for the glory of Christ, having left, indeed driven from their homeland, now finally subject to many evils, perhaps bravely and strongly fight to support the same. I wish it were known from others reporting about me. For you know that the midwife judges better about the offspring than the mother herself. Clearly (perhaps I report imprudently) I acted in a place where, according to the nature of the time, not having opposed impiety, having even consented, not having protested, having cried out against abomination, and not having resisted even at the risk of life, I provided opportunities for the destruction of many. So much did the troublesome business of ill-negotiated desire trouble us. And certainly, I have advanced to this point, that although I am forced to leave the place, the abomination itself will not succeed, unless, with the affairs turned upside down again, worse things happen than now. And my departure will cause many to remain with piety, I say to the brothers, whose necks, as much as I could, I would have opposed. The danger of exile was imminent. For those rascals who celebrate mass and, like wolves, devastate the folds of Christ, there is almost no safe place among us again, unless, as I fear, the five so-called sacred places (according to the saying, the accursed hunger for gold) cause us greater trouble. With these and their collaborators among us, the atheist spirit burns wonderfully, and bitter bile boils them. May our Lord, the overseer from above, mock them.</p>
      <p>Farewell (for the paper will fail the writer) and keep me intimately recommended. And if you can in any way and manner, support, protect, preserve. Convey greetings to the strongest of lions, Leon, and all the pious, unknown in conversation, but well-known in the name of Christ.</p>
      <p>From Lichtensteig, on the Ides of February, in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Balthasar Hirt of Phorcensis, formerly preacher of the church of Lichtensteig.</p>
      <p>From the one who brings you these letters, I ask, if you have leisure, to inquire more diligently how things are with us. From whose response, instill in his mind and, as if with a conceived theme, with a certain pious admonition and ardent exhortation, gradually strengthen, raise, and fortify his perhaps somewhat lukewarm mind in the faith of Christ. For it will matter, as I estimate, not a little, if you thus stimulate him, and that sincerely for your sincerity. His office, since it is almost exposed to all, can easily benefit many.</p>
      <p>To the pious and upright M. Heinrich Bullinger, most renowned preacher of the church of Zurich, his most candid teacher.</p>
