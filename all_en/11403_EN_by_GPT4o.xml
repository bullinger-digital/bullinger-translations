    <p xml:id="regest1">His desire to be able to speak with him about questions of Christian doctrine has been further strengthened by reading "De origine erroris"; this work, as well as Zwingli's "Amica exegesis," his swan song, surpasses everything else he has encountered in the field of theology. If Bullinger continues to develop his talent in this way, the [Lutheran] flesh-eaters and bloodsuckers, about whom he cannot write without anger, will have nothing more to chatter about. He does not address the declining church discipline, as Viret writes extensively about it [No. 1358], but he joins the request for a statement. Greetings to the colleagues.</p>

      <p>Although I have always greatly desired to see you in person and to discuss many matters with you that seem to greatly pertain to the purity of the Christian religion, this desire has been remarkably and almost unbelievably increased by those two books you wrote last year with unique diligence, remarkable erudition, and keen judgment on the origin of error. I will speak candidly, with the Lord as my witness: I acknowledge that nothing has ever come into the hands of men in the discipline concerning the Best and Greatest God from which I have been so confirmed, from which I have drawn so much solid learning, as from those sources of yours, discovered and purified from errors, and from the "Amica Exegesis" of the most learned and indeed purest man, Huldrych Zwingli: which book that truly Christian doctor sang as his swan song, close to his fate.</p>
      <p>Therefore, continue in your virtue, most learned Bullinger: thus one ascends to the stars, thus triumphal crowns are received by those who contend in the Christian arena. Now, who does not see how keenly you must devote yourself entirely to sustaining that role, which you have long since undertaken with the great expectation of almost all the learned, the admiration of the unlearned, and the joy of the good and those wishing to live piously in the Lord Jesus? If you continue further and thus diligently multiply the talent of the heavenly Lord for a long time (which I am most convinced of), I do not indeed see what those flesh-eating and blood-sucking men, whom I deem worthy - but I will restrain myself, especially since it is scarcely possible to mention such furious minds without some appearance of fury, can still chatter about.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, ecclesiastical discipline still lies dormant, nor do those whose role it is to raise it with all their might come forward. I would perhaps have discussed this with you at greater length, had I not understood that this has been done most copiously by my most beloved P. Viret. I will only add this, both to confirm his complaint and because we are most pressed by this issue, that we desire nothing so vehemently at this time as to know what you think about this whole matter. If we obtain this, you will have bound us to you forever, and you will have done something worthy of both your erudition and your profession. Farewell. Lausanne, 9th day before the calends of March, 1540.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Béat Comte of Donzères.</p>
      <p>I bid all your colleagues heartily farewell.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich, Heinrich Bullinger, a man to be respected by me.</p>
