      <p>To the most learned, illustrious, and upright men Heinrich Bullinger and Theodor Bibliander, who bear the office of Huldrych Zwingli, the most invincible hero, in Zurich, esteemed teachers and patrons, Conrad Gessner sends greetings, etc.</p>
      <p>Whenever I begin to ponder, my revered teachers, the immense ingratitude of our age, it is astonishing to say how much my entire mind is consumed with sorrow. "So rare is faith in friendships, so ready is the forgetfulness of the dead," to use the words of Pliny. For there is no one among us who even with a single word shows a grateful mind towards that most valiant hero, the father of the fatherland and the light of the world, Huldrych Zwingli, in whose footsteps (which may happily benefit the entire republic of Zurich) you now also tread.</p>
      <p>I rightly call him a hero, as no force, no threats, no treachery, and finally no envy ever swayed him from truth and honor. Therefore, he was most worthy not only to be praised in words but also to be depicted in gold, ivory, silver, and Parian marble. That hero, I say, a man of solid praise, of perfect and complete virtue, while he is celebrated with the highest honor among foreign nations, lies neglected among us alone, from whom he deserved the most. No honor is given to him, no reverence, no gratitude for his benefits. This is what I grieve, what moves me most, a heart afflicted with sorrow. For whenever I hear his name, my voice is weakened by tears, and my entire mind is hindered by grief. Indeed, he would be of an iron heart, or rather impious, whom such a great calamity of the entire Christian republic would not move. For we have lost a man, to whom no one in our age was similar, to say otherwise would be sacrilege. He was easily the foremost in every virtue, learned to mix the useful with the honorable, taught in laws, judgments, and arms, presided over the Church of Christ with no less justice than courage, a man endowed with great intelligence, greater truth, and the greatest faith.</p>
      <p>Nature limited his course of life to a short span, but his glory to an immense one; which indeed, the less he sought it, the more he will have it alive and perpetual among all the faithful, "whose good heart obeys the immortals," as the poet says. I would have borne the death of the most valiant hero more bitterly, if I did not know for certain that he himself rejoices and exults with Christ and all the blessed, "who hold the wide heaven." Oh, if only I could be immortal and ageless all my days among the immortal gods, Zwingli, you rejoice.</p>
      <p>He lives and will always flourish, no age, no day will ever be able to extinguish the memory of Zwingli, "in whose calm breast gentle honor and cheerful virtue with weight have placed their seat." Neither heaven nor earth will ever hold the forgetfulness of such a hero, since on earth his glory and fame will never fail, "which is from Zeus to mortals." In heaven indeed, with Elijah, David, and Abraham, or rather with Christ himself, the immortal soul of Zwingli lives and rejoices. But enough of this; "for the word of truth is simple."</p>
      <p>I therefore send to you, most distinguished men, those lamentations of Huldrych Zwingli, the first fruits of our humble field, which I most gladly dedicate to you, who fulfill the office of the hero taken from us with the utmost diligence and faith. I send them so that I might offer you some token of a grateful mind towards a man who so excellently deserved of our Switzerland, not as if any praise could be added to such a man by me. For indeed, as long as I live and see the light of day, he will never slip from my youthful memory.</p>
      <p>I therefore desire your excellency to accept whatever it is with a kind mind and to pardon our barbarism.</p>
      <p>Farewell and always cherish me, your pupil, as you have begun. In Strasbourg, in the house of Doctor Wolfgang Fabricius Capito, August 10, 1532.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your excellency, Conrad Gessner.</p>
