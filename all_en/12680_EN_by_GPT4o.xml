    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The long-arrived letter from Bullinger [not preserved] was read by each individual, and the document enclosed with it was returned to the letter carrier, as Bullinger had requested.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Johannes Pontisella [the bearer of the present letter] is going to Zurich to visit his former teachers and students. He will present his concerns himself. However, he has asked Comander to testify with this letter that he is not acting frivolously. The monastery bailiff [Wolfgang Salet], who manages the monastery's properties, is causing him great difficulties. Comander is not pleased with Pontisella's departure, but given Pontisella's unpleasant situation, he had to yield to him. Bullinger should take care of him and not be upset if Comander, who once advocated so much for Pontisella's appointment [in Chur], now recommends him back to Zurich. This is due to the circumstances.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] There is nothing special to report, except that Lindau and Constance will send delegates to the upcoming Gotteshaustag, which will take place next Sunday [October 24]. Bullinger should report any news.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Greetings, also from Johannes Blasius, as well as from Comander and Blasius to all the pastoral colleagues in Zurich.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. We have long since received your letter of kindness, dearest Bullinger. We read everything individually and returned the document, as you had instructed, if the letter carrier was faithful.</p>

      <p>Johannes Pontisella has decided to visit Zurich and especially his most faithful patrons and students. He will explain his situation in person. However, he requested a letter from me to testify to you that he is not acting out of frivolity or inconsistency. The monastery bailiff, who manages and dispenses those ecclesiastical goods, is severe and troublesome to Johannes. If he remains unchanged, Johannes doubts he can endure his behavior and importunity much longer, etc. Indeed, I am very grieved that he is being taken from us; however, lest I seem to obstruct his benefit or safety, I am compelled to consent, and I ask that you, if possible, deign to assist him. Nor should you take offense at my boldness, I pray, as I now wish to return him whom I had anxiously requested. For the times bring about sudden and unexpected changes, so that I often marvel at how everything is so unstable and inconstant. I pray you keep him in your care.</p>

      <p>Nothing new is reported here, except that delegates from Constance and Lindau have come to us for the assembly. They will visit the upcoming meeting of the Three Leagues next Sunday. Whatever you have certain, do not hesitate to write to us.</p>
      <p>Farewell. From the Court of Rhaetia, October 19, 1546.</p>
