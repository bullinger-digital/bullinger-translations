      <p>S. D. P. I received your letters, most distinguished man, sent to me by Mr. Oporinus from Basel (for I have not yet seen the ones you entrusted to Admirabili). I also delivered the letters you enclosed to Mr. Peter Alegretto, and in turn, as you instructed, we communicated our plans. After thoroughly investigating matters on both sides, we indeed found hosts, both doctors and pharmacists, almost in accordance with your wishes, provided the young men can temper and moderate their language. However, they usually take almost no care about the morals and innocence of life of their companions, content to provide them with food and lodging, and that at a very high price. For they demand fifty or at least forty gold coins annually, excluding books, clothing, teachers' salaries, and many other things they need, the total sum of which I leave to your own prudence to estimate and gather. Furthermore, while medicine and other good disciplines particularly flourish here, there is extreme moral corruption in all orders and the utmost license and impunity for all kinds of vices. Therefore, I would not want to advise anyone to send youth here, naturally inclined to such things, unless they have someone to fear, someone to respect, someone to constantly remind them of their duty, who, if necessary, would rebuke or even punish them as they deserve. I could not conceal these things from you out of my regard for you, which I ask you to consider with your usual kindness and fairness. Now I give you all immense thanks for the services so kindly offered to me by you, which I wish I could repay at least in some part; my spirit is indeed most willing, although my abilities are very limited. Please convey my greetings to Mr. Ludwig, your son-in-law, to whom I will write shortly, and to Mr. Frisius and all the others. Farewell, most excellent, learned, and kind man. Paris, during the royal holidays, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Martin Betschart.</p>
      <p>To the man endowed with both utmost piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed leader of the Zürich church, his most revered master. From Zürich.</p>
