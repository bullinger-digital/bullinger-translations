    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer cannot share his opinion on Bullinger's "De sacramentis" due to the market and countless occupations, and he cannot respond to the letter [No. 2376] received the previous day. However, he sends the long-awaited letter [No. 2384] from his brother [Thomas] about the [Frankfurt Federal] Diet.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- A [quarto publication] of four pages has appeared regarding Luther's death. However, soon Luther's admirers will write much more significant works.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Regarding Bullinger's wish that Bucer [may also soon die], Blarer advises restraint. Although he also notes some shortcomings in Bucer, he does not doubt his commitment to Christ's cause. Even if Bucer's manner and way of thinking are different, one should not wish for the death of such an excellent instrument of Christ, especially since neither his nor Luther's death would contribute to resolving the Lord's Supper dispute, as many who rely on Luther's authority will cause even more unrest in the churches.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Blarer is grateful that the Zurichers continue to take care of [Konrad] Hofherr. He will likely have received Blarer's letter, just as Bullinger will have received Blarer's other letter [No. 2381]. Blarer would like to know how Hofherr has continued to behave and what the [Zurichers] think of him. They should speak with him soon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Blarer cannot write more as the messenger [...] is in a hurry.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger should not doubt Blarer's loyalty; he will always report to Bullinger everything that is important for the [Zurichers].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I cannot currently share my thoughts with you or respond to your letter, which I received yesterday. The market is here, and I am entangled in countless occupations. However, I am sending my brother's letter about the [Frankfurt Federal] Diet, which you have reminded me of so many times, so that I may inform you about their proceedings.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>A quarto publication of four pages has already appeared regarding Luther's fate, and soon much more significant works will follow from those who admired the man.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Regarding your wish that Bucer may also soon die, I fear you may not be acting rightly, and I implore and beseech you by our common Savior, whose cause we are serving, not to spread anything so imprudent, as you know that Satan never neglects an opportunity to bring the cause of the Gospel into disrepute. I find much to be desired in Bucer, yet I do not doubt that he seeks the glory of the Lord and the propagation of Christ's kingdom above all. Even if his manner and reasoning do not entirely align with our views, we should not wish for the death of such an excellent instrument of Christ. Moreover, I do not believe that the cause of the Lord's Supper will fare better due to Luther's death, as I know there are quite a few who, relying on the authority of the man, will cause even more turmoil in our churches; this will become evident in time. I have always feared for myself since Luther's death, no matter how much his approach to the Lord's Supper displeased me; but I see how recklessly the minds of our age are driven. May the Lord, having mercy on us, manage everything for the better, as we hope!</p>

      <p>I am very grateful that you are taking care of [Konrad] Hofherr. I believe you, as well as he, have received my letters. I am very eager to learn from you what he has done since and what you think of him. For once, he will either be brought back to good sense or he will go hungry. I would not want the latter to happen to him unless he himself willingly brings about his own misfortune. But may Christ bring better things with him!</p>

      <p>I cannot write more, as I hear this messenger is leaving and will not wait.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Ah, my venerable and dearest brother! In my faith, be assured, never doubt anything! Nothing will be concealed that seems to pertain to you. I speak with you as with my own soul, and believe me, I will never betray your trust.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Commend us diligently to the Lord. Our people greet you. Konstanz, March 19, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, his beloved lord and brother, etc.</p>
