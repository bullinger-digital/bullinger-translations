    <p xml:id="regest1">Did not respond to the letter from last autumn [No. 1419]; is glad to learn from the letter and gift delivered by Rudolf [Gwalther] that Bullinger does not resent his silence, and thanks him for his friendship. Does not wish to report on the unpleasant course [of the religious discussion]; [Bucer] is trying in vain to reconcile the irreconcilable, but the theologians who remain behind when Melander departs tomorrow with the prince [Philip of Hesse] will not engage in any rotten compromises; Gwalther has copied the documents; nothing is to be expected from such meetings. The prince is well-disposed towards the Swiss churches and will respond as promised, while [Johannes] Draconites will write to the Zurich pastors on behalf of everyone; Gwalther, whom they also hold in high regard and recommend to the Zurich council, will report everything else orally. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Christ.</p>
      <p>Christoph, the printer, our mutual friend, brought your letters at the autumn fair, most learned and dearest Bullinger. Although they were, as everything from you, most welcome, I did not respond due to the reasons explained by our Rudolf. I am glad, therefore, that you have taken my silence in good part. I know that you are mine, as much as you are, not only from the letters and the gift sent through Rudolf, but I have noticed from all the books published by you, besides your singular erudition, an admirable kindness and sweetness of manners towards all good people. Therefore, I beg you, continue to love as you have begun; I, in turn, will never cease to love you. I first give thanks to the most good and great God for having found such a pious, learned, and humane friend. Then, I also give you immense thanks for not erasing me from the list of your friends and for declaring your friendship towards me with an exceptional gift. May Christ grant that I may be able to repay it someday!</p>
      <p>It is tedious to write about how everything is going here at the diet; for everything is conducted with such deceit, ambiguous words, and I don't know what prejudices, that you would swear Satan himself is raging and trying to completely extinguish the gospel. Some of our people, under a pretext quite plausible to the ignorant, are indeed striving for this, promising, if it pleases the gods, a reconciliation between Cain and Abel, light and darkness, Christ and Belial. But I know, he will sweat in vain. Our prince is quite steadfast, and the brothers who are here today are most steadfast. Tomorrow the prince will leave, whom I will follow. The brothers who remain here will not involve themselves in those most tedious disputes from the cheese pot. Rudolf has transcribed all the acts. You, with your prudence, will easily judge whether the adversaries seek the glory of God and the reformation of the churches, as they wish to appear.</p>
      <p>No one will persuade me that the churches are being consulted by diets, synods, and assemblies; experience testifies to this. I rejoice that I am to return to my church.</p>
      <p>I hope, with Christ's help, to promote the evangelical cause more through constant prayers and sacred sermons than through those most vain reconciliations.</p>
      <p>Be fully convinced that our prince is well-disposed towards all the Swiss churches, as Rudolf, to whom I have communicated everything, will explain.</p>
      <p>He was diligent and willing in our ministry here. We are grateful that you sent him to us. We all desire and ask that through you and your colleagues, he be commended to the most prudent council of Zurich in our name. As soon as he arrived here, I took him to the prince and he presented the council's letters. The prince will respond, as he has promised. Doctor Draconites will respond on behalf of all of us to the most illustrious and dearest men, the ministers of the Zurich church, whom you will greet most dutifully in my name and ask that they hold me in their commendation. I do not judge it necessary to write more. For I am sending a living and speaking letter, our most eloquent Rudolf, whom we will not allow to be only yours, but we also want him to be ours; we have communicated everything to him.</p>
      <p>Farewell, therefore, in the Lord, who may deign to preserve us all by His Spirit in the word of truth. I commend myself to you and your church in prayers, which I promise to do in return. Again and again, farewell and take everything in good part.</p>
      <p>Hastily, Regensburg, June 13, 1541.</p>
      <p>Your most obedient Dionysius Melander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Zurich church, a lord and brother in the Lord to be revered, to his hands.</p>
