      <p>Greetings. For the first time, these five tables of propositions have been published here, which I wanted to send to you because I hoped they would be pleasing, and indeed not only in these small matters, but in whatever way I can, I will most gladly show you gratitude. I will write more soon.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, fare well. I wish well-being to your entire family, then to Mr. Pellican, Theodor, Amman, Collin, our most kind teachers.</p>
      <p>Wittenberg, December 28, 1537.</p>
      <p>Otto, your most obedient.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant minister of the word, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father.</p>
