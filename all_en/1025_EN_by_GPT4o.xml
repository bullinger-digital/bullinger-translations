      <p>Frankfurt am Main, 14th September 1550.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I received your two letters, dear friend, with a joyful heart, and what you ask will in no way be burdensome to me. I received the books and bundles of letters from Mr. Froschauer and will take every care to ensure that they can be delivered to their intended recipients, and I take this responsibility upon myself.</p>
      <p>The rumor that is being spread about a new English uprising is baseless and false.</p>
      <p>I am sending you the Inquisition (as they call it) written by the authors in Leuven, both in Flemish and German. There is nothing new yet that is worthy of being written about.</p>
      <p>I have read through what the Emperor proposed to the states of the empire, and nothing is more pressing than that the rebels be punished and his religion be established; he also insists on the council being resumed in Trento. The response exists; however, I have not yet seen it. They say the Emperor is seriously suffering from ill health. I am glad that you have come to an agreement with the confederates, especially that the possession of the castle has come to you. This is certainly a great advantage for the city. May God expand your lands and preserve you from every stain of this present life. Amen.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife and all the learned men in my name and in my wife's name; I will not forget your greetings to friends and acquaintances in England. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Yours, Burcher.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished bishop of piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a very dear friend.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
