      <p>Your most welcome letter reached me, my father, delivered on July 22nd along with a pious little gift, certainly no less appreciated. I truly love you, dearest father, for your most excellent disposition towards me, and unless I reciprocate in kind, you may consider me the most ungrateful of men. I eagerly read the booklet. I praise and agree with everything. For you discuss matters piously and prudently. However, whether it has reached our Poland, I do not know; if not yet, our Thretius will bring it to you with the sons of that man to whom your writing was dedicated by Mr. Simler, although having left them in Heidelberg, I think he will only make a short trip to you. This I have from those Poles who are in Basel, daily expecting Thretius. We, however, plan to sail to England immediately after the wedding of the King of Navarre, so that my young man, Johannes von Krotoschin, may also see and learn about the customs and religion of that nation. Prince of Transylvania, Stephan BÃ¡thory, is said to have embraced the Augsburg Confession.</p>
      <p>They say that the book by Petrus Ramus on church discipline has been condemned by the Genevans. However, I do not know what kind of book it was. I approve of discipline because I have seen it observed devoutly by our Waldensians. And if ever it was necessary in the church, it is now most needed, as charity has grown cold and human laziness has increased remarkably. They say you are depicting the lives of the popes; if so, I pray, my Apelles, that we too may see the painting of such foul monsters. However, I believe you have the book titled "Fasciculus Rerum Expetendarum et Fugiendarum," in which there is a writing by a certain Cardinal Benno, I think, about the crimes of the popes, from which you can refer many things to your commentary, if indeed this cesspool is to be stirred again.</p>
      <p>Rather, I would prefer you to take up the Apocalypse, that most illustrious book, for the third time, as perhaps the end of the world is not yet at hand, you, a man most skilled in antiquity, so that those visions of John may be illustrated by more past histories and from paganism to the times of Constantine the Great, Arianism, Mohammedanism, and the papacy. However, Borrhaus seemed to me at some time to disagree with you. The opinion of the ancients about the Antichrist is known to you, from which Zanchus does not dissent. I am glad that the fur coat was returned to Mr. Simler by my lord palatine. Would that, covered by it, he might produce something good about your Switzerland, which the emperor assigns to the French. My Krotoschin loves and reveres you as a father and wishes you a long life.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Simler, Gwalther, and Wolf, I pray for health from God, and you too, farewell, dear and esteemed father.</p>
      <p>Paris, July 28, 1572.</p>
