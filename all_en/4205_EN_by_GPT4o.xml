      <p>S. D. Our Provost will excuse the brevity of this writing.</p>
      <p>I have explained to him what keeps me from writing. However, I wanted to send these few words to your kindness, so that you do not interpret my silence differently than it truly is. For a long time, I have received quite copious letters from both you and Beza, our dearest brother; but I have not yet been able to respond to them. Another opportunity will be given.</p>
      <p>The task assigned to him, the Provost has carried out most diligently and faithfully, and not unsuccessfully, as he himself will report. No better or more suitable executor for this business could have been sent.</p>
      <p>I had also written to Basel about the same matter to Mr. Sulcer; he responds that he hopes well, as he has understood that the whole business will soon be settled by amicable composition. And may the Lord grant us peace!</p>
      <p>Greet Mr. Viret, Mr. Beza, and all the brothers in order.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord for us and especially for me, that I may continue successfully with much fruit in my ministry. Farewell forever, dearest brother.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, February 3, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>As a severe headache, which recurs almost every month, was troubling me, so that I did not go out when the Provost arrived, our Gwalther did a good job here. I also dealt with everything with Mr. Consul on the third or second day.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his most esteemed lord and dearest brother. Geneva.</p>
