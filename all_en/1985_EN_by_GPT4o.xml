      <p>S. D. Your letters, most esteemed friend, have always been most delightful to me, no matter how much the injustice of the times now disturbs everything. I read your sermon on the Lord's Supper from another copy, before yours reached me, with the greatest pleasure of spirit, although almost the entire content had already been diligently impressed upon my mind. I sent a copy to the Exchequer Arnold without delay; he also received it with joy, informing me that the Elector Palatine, having gathered several theologians, among whom Brenz holds the first place, is consulting about the order of the church. I have, through letters, dissuaded these vain attempts as much as I could, not at all ignorant of certain opinions and how sinisterly human constitutions turn out, especially because nothing stable can easily be established among so many differing ceremonies, unless a more august synod is convened. Your sermon on the Lord's Supper is extolled with wonderful praises by the wise and pious in Augsburg; it was also first presented to me here.</p>
      <p>Papism and Lutheranism may rage; the truth will advance to the honor of the Father through Christ.</p>
      <p>Prince Augustus of Saxony begins to perform the electoral office and to bind the subjects of the electorate to himself by oath; he is also about to hold a very frequent assembly in Leipzig, where all the magnates of his empire will gather, namely more than five thousand knights, not counting the previous army, the remnants of his brother Maurice's slain forces. There is a rumor that Augustus is entirely intent on not only avenging his brother's death but also bringing to completion Maurice's undertaking of recovering liberty. He has as allies the King of Denmark and the principal cities, which are called maritime.</p>
      <p>Margrave Albert, weak in strength and the sinews of war, is striving not far from the city of Hanover to enlist knights and soldiers, either to aid the Emperor or to harass the enemy bishops. But oh, how difficultly he has emerged.</p>
      <p>Peace among us is entirely doubtful only because of the lust for ruling and raging of certain cities. In sum: things stand on the old sand.</p>
      <p>I commend my Jonas, who was previously well recommended to you, once again. I was not able to write to your son-in-law Symbler this time; however, Jonas will show him my letters at my command, from which he will understand what I wish. You will greet the heads of your city, the chief scribe, and each of your colleagues along with the rest of my friends on my behalf.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Very quickly from Lauingen, September 1, 1553. Yours, Georg Fr√∂lich (Laetus) from Lomnitz.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the Zurich church, esteemed friend and lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
