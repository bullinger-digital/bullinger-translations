      <p>Greetings. At this hour, letters have been brought to me by the public courier of our city, both from Ulm and Augsburg, which are recent, and as soon as I read them again, I took care to have them delivered to you by the messenger who conveniently appeared. I would have sent the printed book "Interim" (as Frecht calls it), if I did not know that a copy is already at hand for you. Just ensure that the name of our Sayler is not revealed. You also have letters sent from Lindau to a certain compatriot, in which you will clearly understand what schemes Granvella, with his son the cardinal, exercises on the miserable cities under the pretext of the imperial name. But you will also learn from Sayler's letters about the mind of Pope Paul, through deceit and cunning. May the Lord preserve us, so that we can be an example and encouragement to many who place their one and only hope in the salvation of Switzerland according to Christ! Farewell.</p>
      <p>From St. Gallen, very swiftly, on the fifth day before the calends of June, in the year 1548. Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the city of ZÃ¼rich, his own.</p>
