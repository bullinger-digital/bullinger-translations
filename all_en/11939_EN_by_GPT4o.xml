    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's letter; he himself has much more to thank him for. Continues to advocate for a joint letter from the Confederates to the Imperial Estates; beyond that, each place should act as it can justify before God. It would still be good if the Confederates would write to [Konstanz]. He is pleased to hear what Bullinger writes at the end [about Konstanz's accession to the Confederation], but would prefer to discuss it with him in person. Reminds [of the hoped-for mediation by Zurich in the property dispute between Konstanz and] the Dean of Kreuzlingen [Georg Tschudi]. Greetings. Thanks for the information on inheritance cases. Agrees with Bullinger's interpretation of the discovery of Emperor Honorius's tomb.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Especially trusted, dear lord and brother, I have well received your letter and understood its contents. May the faithful God make everything turn out for the best, as we both mean well and faithfully. There is no need for thanks towards me; you have much more and greater debts (deserved) from me. God willing, I could show you service and complete brotherly goodwill; I would certainly prove it with the unreserved extension of all my abilities. These are common matters, in which we should both rightly be very interested; therefore, no special thanks are needed.</p>
      <p>But for now, regarding these common matters, I can only answer you in haste that I still consider it good for many excellent reasons, firstly that the Confederates give a unanimous response to the Imperial Estates and yet each place acts as it can justify before God the Lord.</p>
      <p>Secondly, it would still be good if the Confederates had written to my lords, regardless of the concern you mentioned; for I have no doubt that they will deal with my lords in many ways and that this will be beneficial; if this writing were to happen, it would give them reason to respond more cautiously in other places. I was not displeased to hear the last point of your letter concerning our city and you; for I also have all sorts of thoughts about this matter. However, since it is a difficult and extensive matter in many ways, I have not been able to open my heart and mind to you about it, and would prefer to do so orally rather than trust the pen, if I could come to you at a convenient place without any suspicion from people.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant grace and favor for all good. Amen. Do not forget the Dean of Kreuzlingen, about whom I have written to you before.</p>
      <p>Convey all good wishes to my gracious lord RÃ¶sti with the offering of possible service. I will be tireless (unremitting, eager) in all these matters; you should trust me completely; just let us quietly accomplish everything. Pray to the Lord faithfully for us.</p>
      <p>I thank you most highly for your diligence in writing to me about the inheritance cases with all good information.</p>
      <p>Omen, what you take from the discovered body of Honorius in Rome, I find exceedingly commendable, nor would I consider it vain. April 16.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, his venerable and dearest brother.</p>
