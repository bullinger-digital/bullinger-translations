      <p>Most illustrious prince, most gracious lord, I pray to our Lord Jesus Christ to bless you and all yours and to protect you from all evil. I finally received your gracious letter, dated in Krakau on February 26 of the past year, about 7 months ago. I give your kindness my greatest thanks for the benevolence you have shown me, in that you have kindly accepted the book dedicated to your piety by me and have promised, in your generosity, that if I desire to have any furs from your region, you will ensure that I have them. I truly value this benevolence of your humanity no less than the benefit itself, and I request nothing from your generosity except that your piety continues to do what it has done so far, to help and promote the holy Gospel of Christ in these northern regions. As I am a minister of this Gospel, I sincerely desire nothing more earnestly than that it be propagated as far as possible. Indeed, I most earnestly request, beseech, and implore from your piety that in the vast duchy entrusted to your care and faith by God, you ensure the conformity of doctrine and ceremonies with the churches of Kleinpolen and also of Russland, and that you obtain from the most serene king that this same thing be done elsewhere too, so that under one king and in one kingdom, there may not be divided and indeed multiple churches from the one universal church. Your piety will perform a work worthy of a prince here, and the Lord will favor your endeavor and labors and will give you the greatest reward. Much indeed was lost to the Polish churches when the man worthy of immortal glory, Herr Johannes a Lasco, passed away.</p>
      <p>But Christ still lives, the invincible truth lives, the Lord raises up other pastors for His church, if we do not cease to pray to Him. Therefore, be of strong spirit, most illustrious prince, and continue in helping, propagating, and establishing the truth. May the Lord our God grant your piety His spirit, through whom you may do those things that please Him. I commend myself to your humanity, most gracious prince.</p>
      <p>Given in Zürich on May 26 in the year of our Lord 1560. Dedicated to Your Highness, Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious prince and duke of Olyka, Palatine of Wilna, Grand Marshal of the Duchy of Litauen, etc.</p>
