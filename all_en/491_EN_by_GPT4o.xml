      <p>Greetings. Since our Alexius was about to go there, I especially wanted to write for this reason, so that he might encourage you to write back when the opportunity arises. For I do not doubt (as we have learned from the recently sent examples of letters) that suggestions from friends fly to you daily, not only secret ones but also those which it is beneficial for your friends to know. Among us, there is a rumor flying that a new and indeed large garrison will soon be imposed on the miserably serving Constance, perhaps for the reason that by such a scarecrow it might dissuade the Swiss from negotiating with the French, although I am very suspicious of that which they assert as certain: that soon the Emperor will occupy the entire land of Württemberg with all its dominion and will indeed hire the strength of Germany in that place to use against the Saxons. The Saxons are indeed publicly pretexted; but against whom he is about to move, it is known only to those few who are in the know.</p>
      <p>The Saxons deny that they will do anything contrary to the doctrine once received. In Leipzig, something of ceremonies was conceded in favor of Julius Pflug; however, in their school, the freedom of doctrine remains. Philip recently wrote to a certain citizen of Lindau, among other things, as if constrained in captivity, with these words: "Indeed, I will not refuse to bear servitude without impiety; however, I will not change anything about the doctrine." I sent your truly learned Decades with a sure messenger.</p>
      <p>Frechtus, who recently wrote to me from Nuremberg, having experienced harsh captivity, now stays privately with his sister. Sixtus Dietrich has died, and Frechtus is called to his place, who has so far refused for this reason, lest he might seem to have accepted, that he will not preach anything against the Interim.</p>
      <p>For this was very solemnly demanded by Doctor Haß and a few others from the Emperor's court, while they instructed those dismissed not to teach Christ against the faith of the Emperor in any place of the pomerium, which the Noric senate also demands. He earnestly requested me at the end of the letter to greet you in his name. Osiander preaches among the Prussians in a very populous city, which they call Königsberg. He published a writing against the Interim, which I hear is approved by many. I wish he would teach as purely and sacredly about the presence of Christ in the supper as he has severely and gravely brought forth many things against the papal ceremonies in that little book of his. It has been written to us that King Philip on March 30 greeted his father in Brussels with a very splendid retinue, and his arrival was very pleasing.</p>
      <p>Therefore, nothing will remain for further forging of plans; everything is at hand. May the Lord help us and not allow us to be tempted more than our miserable shoulders can bear. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours and mine, and commend me to the most honorable men, the lords consuls.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, on the 19th day of April, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To the pious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the holy church of Zürich, his lord and friend to be especially honored.</p>
