      <p>S. I truly have poor correspondence with writing, I must confess; but I am partly hindered by my excessive gout, which has troubled me greatly for almost a month now, so that I do not always have a messenger when I would like. No one comes to me unless I need them; so I also do not go anywhere in the chancellery and elsewhere to ask, but so far have received nothing, although I have not done anything special either, since all matters are spoken and written so uncertainly that no one can rely on them. Recently, the peace has come, so it is said; I am sending you a copy, it is from [Junker] Petermann von Wattenwyl; therefore, please send it back to me. In it, you will see what it is, although I suspect you have long known about it. Meanwhile, Dr. Chandaeus informs me, to you, as I believe, known both for the splendor of his lineage, for he is a baron, and for the excellence of his learning, who is now in Lausanne, that only those from Rochelle have accepted the peace to some extent; Montauban and Nîmes do not want it, nor does the majority in the Dauphiné, and they are still on both sides in arms. That is the latest I have heard about these matters. The day before yesterday, someone told me that the Schultheiss Heid from Freiburg, who was the commander in the campaign, had returned home; but I do not yet consider it entirely certain. From the Netherlands, we have not heard a word for a long time; however, a messenger has gone to Heidelberg; he might bring something. Here, people are troubled by the weather; no one can sow; much good is spoiled in grain, oats, and hay in the mountain regions, which cannot be harvested. In some places, grain and oats are still deep in the snow.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, there is concern that the wine will become sour before it ripens. Yet, in many places, the vines are still doing reasonably well; but they do not want to ripen; therefore, there will be a shortage of good wine, and there is a great scarcity of old wine; everyone keeps it for themselves if they have any left. My lord von Mülinen is not well in his leg; on St. John's Day, a mad dog bit him there, which was immediately killed. He treated it for a long time and much until it healed; now it is troubling him again, so that he has not been able to go out for 14 days, and I am worried about him. However, do not mention this to anyone; people do not like it when much is known and written about their affairs.</p>
      <p>Steigerus is well by the grace of the Lord, as are Diesbachius, Gravenrietus, and Manuel; they greet you. Hagenbergius suffers from the same illness as I do and is somewhat more severely afflicted than I am, as he is more corpulent and indulges himself more. My father-in-law, wife, and all our relatives are also well and greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, yours as always.</p>
      <p>I wrote this eight days ago, thinking I would have a messenger, but I was mistaken; therefore, I am sending it now. What was said about Heid was false; he sent a servant, but he did not come himself. Meanwhile, it is said about the people of La Rochelle that they also have not accepted this peace. It is all so uncertain that one knows neither beginning nor end. I hope to hear something certain from you.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, September 24, 1573.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most faithful pastor of the Church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
