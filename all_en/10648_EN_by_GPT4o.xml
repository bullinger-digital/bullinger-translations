    <p xml:id="regest1">Apologizes, citing his work on his commentaries, for only now responding to the request that has been made three times. The work attributed to Ambrosius ["De sacramentis"] must be inauthentic, as it does not fit with other works by this author; however, Erasmus, as the editor, avoided taking a position on the authorship question; Bertram [Ratramnus], a contemporary of Charles II, was familiar with the work. Sebastian [...] could have achieved long ago what he has now accomplished. Representatives [of Zürich] are ready to engage in negotiations with the Abbot [of St. Gallen] on behalf of the poor [people of the house of God?]. Requests news about the armies [fighting around Tunis].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I am ashamed and regretful, honorable man, that I am so ungrateful to you, who have deserved so well of me, that you are compelled to ask the same thing from me for the third time. But I beg you by Christ to forgive me this fault. I am overwhelmed with business beyond what can be expressed. My commentaries on the Acts are being printed for the second time. Meanwhile, I am writing on Paul's Epistle to the Ephesians, I have written on the Galatians, and I intend to write further, if the Lord grants grace, on the Philippians and Colossians before the next Frankfurt fair, etc.</p>
      <p>Regarding the books of Ambrosius, I feel as you do: these cannot be the work of such an excellent author and of such refined judgment. The style does not match with other works of Ambrosius. Furthermore, he follows a completely different method in explaining the sacraments in those books that are undoubtedly his, compared to these. Just compare what he writes about the Eucharist in these with what is read in the second book of "De Officiis," chapter 28, and in the first letter to the Corinthians, chapter 11, and you will see how unlike himself he is. Moreover, everything in these books is treated more coldly than Ambrosius's sharpness and diligence would allow. Erasmus, in his usual manner, conceals and hides his judgment. For he does not even mention these books with a word. However, he relegated them to the last volume, so I do not doubt that he considers this work to be by some Magon. Yet he did not want to mark these books with his judgment, being cunning, lest he be believed to be a supporter of our opinion on the sacraments, which is that we confess only two or at most three. However, you are not unaware of how Bertram used these books. He lived in the times of Charles II.</p>
      <p>I would believe that Sebastian's cause would not fare badly if he were more constant and modest. And he would have achieved long ago what he has now achieved if he had followed sound advice.</p>
      <p>Regarding the cause of the poor, I hope this will happen: If some honest people would again ask Antronium to let them stay and not force them, and if he does not do it, then they would report such things, and on the next day, my gracious lords would handle it with the places, so that they would speak with the abbot, so that he would let them stay peacefully and without compulsion. I have this hope for our people. For I have spoken with some who heard of this tyranny with displeasure.</p>
      <p>If you have any news about the Caesarean or Mauritanian, Parthian or Turkish army, I beg you to write. You would also do Röyst a great favor.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently.</p>
      <p>July 7, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Doctor Joachim Vadian, my most esteemed lord. St. Gallen.</p>
