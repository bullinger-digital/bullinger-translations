      <p>Thomas Harding to Heinrich Bullinger, overseer of the divine word in the church of Zürich, sends greetings.</p>
      <p>If we accept what has been said by the ancients, that "lack of communication has dissolved many friendships," what is there, most learned Bullinger, to prevent us from hoping that the friendships of good men can be reconciled and established if they are greeted courteously; especially if this is done for just reasons, so that all appearance of flattery or ambition is absent? Indeed, the reason for my writing to you has been made sufficiently great by both the duty of my office and the most just requests of these young men, that they be commended to you. For who is so alien to all humanity that he would not be impelled to write and give thanks for the kindnesses you bestowed upon me in person, when around the beginning of May, nearly three years ago, I was traveling through your area on my way to Italy, where I was then going to pursue the cultivation of my intellect? For I cannot forget with what kindness you received me, with what generosity you embraced me: not to mention, in the meantime, how with learned and weighty conversation you detained and indeed nourished my mind, eager for your company, in your house for several hours, freeing me from every scruple and doubt as I inquired and hesitated about certain matters of no small importance, as they indeed seem to me.</p>
      <p>To this was added another argument of love and benevolence (for so I must interpret it) not of a common kind, that you even inquired about my name, as if I were someone of importance, and inscribed it in your books. Whenever I think of these benefits (and I think of them very often), what Timotheus said about Plato's dinner, when he was invited by him and met him the next day, that Plato's dinners are not only pleasant at the time but also on the following day; the same seems to me to be said much more extensively about your kindness, not only was it pleasant at the time, but it has been so for many months now, and (as I hope) will be so for many years to come. And indeed, unless the circumstances of my life had led otherwise, and had drawn me almost unwillingly to other places at that time, I would by no means have allowed myself to be separated and parted so soon from your most learned company, whose sweetness I had just begun to taste: since the condition of my affairs has perpetually barred this happiness from me against the will of my mind; it seemed that the remaining option was to propose to myself to enjoy your company and conversation through letters at some time. Indeed, having returned to England these days, as I was seeking some outcome of this matter and thinking of writing to you, Johannes von Ulm, formerly your student, as he reports, conveniently visited me. He asks that I commend these young men to you in a written letter. Which indeed I have willingly undertaken to do, both in his name, with whom I have had some acquaintance, and also in the name of those whom I see to be such that, on account of their singular modesty, integrity, and learning, they most justly deserve the duty of exceptional commendation. Therefore, I would like you not to disdain this my commendation for your most pleasant and noble nature, and to embrace these young men, Andreas from Chur and Stumph, who have returned to you, with your benevolence and favor. Meanwhile, I dare to assure you from their most honorable and humane manners, that whatever benefit usually comes to you from the studies of the best men, no less will come to you from the favor of these, and that you will find them to be young men with proven integrity, humanity, and observance, and indeed with the most steadfast favor. You will certainly bind me with the greatest benefit if you show yourself to us in such a way that they understand that this my commendation has had some weight with you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Oxford, from the New College. 14th of the calends of November. Give our Butler my most diligent greetings from me. In the year of our Lord 1551.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, overseer of the divine word in the church of Zürich, let these be delivered.</p>
      <p>Thomas Harding.</p>
