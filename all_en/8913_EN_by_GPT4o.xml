      <p>Greetings. I would gladly write much, but the times do not provide me with the material. From Geneva, my friends only write to me that Mr. Beza has not yet returned from the NÃ®mes synod; they think the reason is that those, for whose sake this meeting was primarily convened, did not appear. From this, I fear more dissensions will arise and greater hatreds will emerge. With us, everything is peaceful by the grace of the Lord.</p>
      <p>I would send back to you the news you last sent me, if they were not still in Mr. Diesbach's hands; I will send them back as soon as I have received them.</p>
      <p>He sends his greetings to you along with the lords consuls and treasurers, Telamonio, etc., who will soon come to you. Through him, I will write or send, if I have anything more.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, May 29, 1572.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
