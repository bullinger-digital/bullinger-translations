    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Myconius would have understood Bullinger's letter better if he had described the location of the mentioned places more precisely. Where is Ballmertshofen? Myconius does not know. Bullinger should kindly take this into account.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It's nice that Bullinger provides comfort along with his sad news! Over time, Myconius becomes increasingly aware that the believer can do nothing without Christ! David knew this too. For whenever he cried out to God with all his heart, he trusted in God alone. However, this is not so easy, as every pious person knows from their own experience! Once you have achieved something, you do not give it up so quickly. But you must do this, otherwise the enemy will prevail!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Myconius has long wanted to ask about the preachers of the princes [Johann Friedrich of Saxony and Philipp of Hesse], because with their sermons they exert great influence on the leaders of the two armies. They probably know Bullinger, but Myconius has never heard that any of them have written to Bullinger. Bullinger should forgive this curiosity.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] How is it that the godless Emperor [Charles V] succeeds in so much? He must have good Spanish advisors! However, their plans are merely human constructs, which are by no means permanent! If the [Protestants] have God on their side, they can only be victorious!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Greetings, also to all those who sent their regards to Myconius.</p>

      <p>S. If you could just add in your letters, where you write the names of places, that the village is near this or that town, or that the town is this far from a river or some notable city, everything would be clearer to me. I do not know where Ballmertshofen is. Kindly consider this, my venerable Bullinger, as my foolishness.</p>

      <p>While you write those sad things, you beautifully console in the Lord. And I, more and more, experience how necessary it is for the Lord to be firmly in the hearts of His people, as Christ rightly said: "Without me, you can do nothing." Therefore, David, understanding this, continually cried out with all his heart, with all his soul, trusting no one but the Lord alone. But how difficult this truly is, the pious experience, who, when they place their effort into this or that matter and it succeeds as they wish; good God, how difficult it is for the flesh to endure being stripped of its (what it considers) praise! Come on! It must be so, that all trust is placed in the Lord, or the enemies will prevail.</p>

      <p>I have long wanted to ask you, which preachers the princes have and what manner they observe in preaching. For it seems to me that skillful preachers, who never lose sight of the Lord, can achieve much among the leaders of the armies. They know you, if there are any, and yet I have not understood that any of them have ever written to you. Foolish, what I say. Yet I wonder how the matter stands.</p>

      <p>I am amazed at the unfortunate Emperor, where these fortunate (that is, appearing fortunate) plans come from, unless perhaps they are from others. He has Spaniards more than enough, cunning ones, yet in the meantime godless! Therefore, the plans are human and thus by no means solid. If we have God, we will conquer!</p>

      <p>Farewell in Christ. Greet in the Lord all who have greeted me. Let us pray to the Lord from the heart and with faith, that He may protect His word. Basel, 24th of November, in the year 1546. Yours, Os. My.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable in Christ. Zurich.</p>
