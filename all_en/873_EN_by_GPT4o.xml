      <p>Greetings. I recently wrote to you through this very printer, who brought no response from you. Hence, I am led to suspect that his virtue is not as evident as others have proclaimed to me; furthermore, if he were as he claims to be, he would not have remained in Zürich for such a long time in such distress; for he would have been assisted by your support or that of other good men, whom I believe are born to help people. Therefore, I implore you by our friendship to write to me clearly what you truly think of this printer, as it will not be a harm to him or any mortal, but it will be a warning to me, so that I may know how to manage him in the future. For I have pledged on his behalf for a rather large sum of money, so that the poor man could have access to his home, which I hear is forbidden in the name of a Bernese creditor. If he keeps his promise, this will perhaps happen without great loss to me; for by his labor he will be able to earn enough to support himself and pay off his debt. If he is naturally inclined to work, it will be well for him, otherwise, it will be bad for both him and me. May God be with everyone, and I beg you to conceal nothing from me. Farewell and reply through this printer, who promised to return within 15 or 20 days after the Easter festival, or certainly through another, if it is given sooner. Basel, the first day of April in the year of our Lord 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Francis Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
