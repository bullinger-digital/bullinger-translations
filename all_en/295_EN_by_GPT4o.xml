      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus, our redeemer, dearest brother. If he has not yet arrived, I believe that a very pious and learned young Italian, a patrician from Siena, who is wandering for the sake of faith in Christ, will soon come to you, as he has undoubtedly already told you or will tell you. He is the son of Mariano Socini the Elder, who is the foremost among the legal scholars teaching law here and is very well known throughout Europe for his profound knowledge of jurisprudence, and he is also pious, most worthy of this son. He writes these enclosed letters to his son, which I ask you to give to him and to receive and support him according to your love and benevolence towards all the pious. By doing so, you will not only fulfill the desire of the brothers for your piety towards him, which has never been lacking, but you will also do something very pleasing to me, as if you were receiving me, whom you have long embraced. Tell him that I am here with his father and, once my affairs, which have been assigned to me in Italy by my prince of W端rttemberg, are settled, I will come to you and greet and speak with him in his father's name; I hope this will happen within this month or at the beginning of November; for I have decided to travel directly and by the safer route through your Switzerland to Z端rich.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your wife and children. Greet Socinus and all the brothers. Given in Bologna, 8th October 1548.</p>
      <p>Nikolaus Maier.</p>
      <p>His name is Lelio Socino. If he has not yet come to you, he will come; therefore, keep these letters from his father with you until the son arrives.</p>
      <p>To the man of outstanding piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy ecclesiastic of the church of Z端rich, his esteemed brother. Z端rich.</p>
