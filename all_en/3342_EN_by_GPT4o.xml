      <p>Marburg, in the month of September, wrote these things: Mr. Andreas Hyperius.</p>
      <p>Regarding the matters I received from Worms, I thought a few things should be added separately, not indeed written to me, but expressed in conversations by some whom I consider trustworthy. On the fifth day of September, Mr. Erhard Schnepf, Mr. Victorinus Strigel from the school in Jena, Mr. Joachim Mörlin, and with him a certain Mr. Martin from Lüneburg, as well as Erasmus Sarcerius from the county of Mansfeld (more names were not given to me), immediately after lunch sought to have a discussion with Mr. Philipp at a certain place. They had, however, set forth in writing their opinion on the Lord's Supper and argued at length with Mr. Philipp, urging him and the others from Wittenberg to confirm it not only in writing but also by oath. The debate was prolonged until evening.</p>
      <p>When asked what led them to pursue this matter beyond everyone's expectation, they responded that they had been given a mandate by the Dukes of Saxony, the sons of Elector Johann Friedrich. The matter was soon reported to the most illustrious Prince of Württemberg, who is one of the presiding members.</p>
      <p>When he heard this, he earnestly expressed his regret that questions, which were not so necessary, were being raised by some privately at a time and place where it was least appropriate, and which could hinder other more serious and public and very necessary affairs. Furthermore, understanding that they had claimed to act by the order of the princes, he immediately communicated the matter through messengers with the Prince of the Palatinate. Therefore, these two princes quickly sent some to the Dukes of Saxony to partly ascertain whether they had ordered it, and partly, if they had, to persuade them to allow such a contention to be quelled. What has happened since that time, I do not have explained.</p>
      <p>It is certain that by the tenth day of September, none of those designated either by our side or by the adversaries had begun to discuss the matters of the churches; for on that day, some of my friends saw and greeted Mr. Paul Eber from Wittenberg in Frankfurt, and there are those who affirm that Mr. Brenz was then in Speyer.</p>
      <p>However, it was believed that they would begin discussions on the 14th day of September. Meanwhile, a new man, Cropper, recently made a little brother of the Pope, is said to maliciously accuse some of those who are joined to him for defending the Roman cause, not only secretly suspecting some of heresy but also wanting to openly prosecute them as guilty. When I hear more or more certain things, I will strive to inform you.</p>
