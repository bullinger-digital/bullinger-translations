    <p xml:id="regest1">Successfully advocated for the extension of [Johannes] Fries' teaching activities in Basel, but from autumn he will be needed in Zurich. Points to the letter sent to Grynäus [from Capito and Bucer to Luther] and sees his mistrust of Bucer confirmed; however, the people of Zurich are still willing to reach an understanding with Luther. Sends through Fries a statement from Vadian [No. 981] and expresses his trust in the people of Basel despite the recent dissonances. Only Grynäus should be informed of this letter.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I do not think, esteemed Myconius, that you expect any response to your previous letters. I have expended all my efforts, and not in vain. For Fries is returning to you, but he will return in the autumn; in the meantime, it will be possible to appoint another in his place, so that your youth receives no detriment from us. Furthermore, we must also take care of our own. And you indeed know how much importance it has in the successful administration and promotion of religion and the republic if schools are rightly established and youth are rightly educated from childhood. We must endure the tedium here and no labor should be avoided. For the most abundant fruit sometimes faithfully responds to labor.</p>
      <p>I believe you have seen that ill-fated letter recently sent by me to Grynäus. You have seen by what arts we have been deceived. I have always suspected and feared this, which I now feel has happened too late. And therefore, we have sometimes seemed to you to be not very sincere, not very loving of peace. But the Lord, who looks into the hearts of all, knows how sincerely we have acted in all things, and you will see further how we do not have factious minds. For we will nonetheless strive for peace and concord, we will seek to restore friendship with Luther, provided he does not reject fair conditions. We will indeed leave Bucer alone for the present, nor will we stir up any disturbances in these troubled times, but we will observe the opportunity.</p>
      <p>You will see our Vadian's letter on this matter written to me, which Fries will present to you and Grynäus, but so that it may later be offered to Vulcan. We love you from the heart, brothers, and not even death itself will disturb that love of ours. Trust us. Although a harsh, leonine, intolerable word may escape us, remember that charity is kind and that we do not weigh our words written to friends and brothers so exactly. Nonetheless, a brother loves a brother, even if he hurls a more reproachful or furious word. As long as we are in the flesh, we are human. Know then how it pains us to be treated thus by those to whom we have entrusted ourselves and all our fortunes. You understand what I am writing about and what you recently wrote to me about Leo's response. We know you, we know your kind spirit towards us, and that what you do, you do with good zeal. Our complaint is woven about others. Therefore, love us. Some seem to labor to separate you from us, but be ours. Keep these things written in your bosom and for you alone; share with Grynäus, then destroy.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with yours.</p>
      <p>April 9, 1537.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant pastor of the Basel church, dearest brother.</p>
