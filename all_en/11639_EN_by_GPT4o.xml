    <p xml:id="regest1">Has already written to Theodor [Bibliander] about the death of Karlstadt, but not about the demon that has been harassing Karlstadt in various ways for half a year and appeared to him the day before his illness, as a man dressed in white and black, while he was standing on the pulpit; Karlstadt's wife [Anna, n√©e von Mochau] reported that similar apparitions had troubled him before, and according to his son Adam, such a spirit had often appeared to him in Zurich as a black dog; Myconius would like to hear Bullinger's opinion on this. The Turk [Sultan Suleiman I] is said to be preparing a campaign through Hungary to Austria and through Poland to Brandenburg, Silesia, Meissen, and Saxony; after his alliance with Persia, he is an even more dangerous enemy to all Christians, yet they remain divided, and the Swiss lull themselves into a false sense of security. After the unexpected departure of a Hungarian [Stephanus Chirotus] chosen as a schoolmaster, Myconius urgently seeks a replacement; in a sermon, he criticized the neglect of the school [by the council], which was unjustly interpreted as a new attack on the university. What he wrote about Karlstadt is to be known only to Theodor [Bibliander]. Greetings from [Johannes] Gast. Recommendation of the letter bearer, a Zurich native returning home.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You have already heard about the death of Karlstadt from the letter recently sent to Theodor [Bibliander]; however, you may not know about the demon, whether it was good or evil, that tormented him for almost half a year before his death. I will tell you the main points to avoid being too lengthy: While reading books, it snatched them from his hand and closed them with force, driving him out of his study into the garden. His collected works were taken to the latrine, but they were found and brought back. Again, they were placed at the mouth of the furnace; his wife, not knowing what it was, threw them into the fire and destroyed them. The day before he fell ill, that is, on December 18th, while preaching, he saw a demon walking through the church around the pews from the pulpit, and, moved by anger, he thought it was a man who was harassing him; for he was dressed in white in front and black in the back, which made him think it was an apparitor. When he descended, he approached some friends and asked who that person was who had wandered so impudently in the church. They replied that they had seen no one. Then he realized it was his demon and was greatly disturbed. He went home and found his family in the garden, where the demon had thrown them at the same time, and he was even more troubled. The next day he began to fall ill, and on the sixth day, he died. After his death, his wife said: "Wherever we were, he always had a spirit harassing him like this." Adam, his son, said: "And in Zurich, it often appeared in the form of a black dog." I would like you to write to me if you have any information about this, and not only that, but also what you think about this harassment.</p>
      <p>As for me, I neither think well nor ill of it, but I pray to the Lord to protect me from such evil.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, on the day I sent the last letters, I received news that the Turk [Sultan Suleiman I] is preparing two armies for war against us, one through Hungary against Austria, the other through Poland into Brandenburg, Silesia, Meissen, and Saxony. Thus, both the papists and the evangelicals have one enemy, but a very serious one, especially after he made an alliance with Persia. What do you think our people will do in such great dissensions, in such great sins, in such great ingratitude? We see the wrath of God and are not corrected. We recognize the dissensions and do not reconcile. We know the diligence of the enemy and remain idle. Meanwhile, the Pope laughs, the Frenchman laughs; the Swiss sit idle as if secure. The impious blaspheme and curse: "Let the Lutherans perish with their gospel, because of whom we are forced to suffer like this." You see, therefore, what we must do.</p>
      <p>We are still establishing a school. We had chosen a certain Hungarian, a truly learned man, from whom I had great hopes; but he left with others. It is a struggle to acquire a good, pious, and learned man to place over the youth.</p>
      <p>By the Lord, I ask you, if you have someone among yours whom you can spare, or if you know someone elsewhere who could be of use, please inform me by letter as soon as possible. On Tuesday, I gave a sermon about establishing the school, or rather, I did; but it went so poorly that they are consulting anew against me. "What did you do wrong?", you ask. I ordered that church goods be used properly. I complained that for a whole decade they had not yet been able to establish a school for the children, and I added: "I do not care about the university." They interpret this as hatred against it, while I was referring to the need for proper education in the lower schools so that the university would not have to struggle. Thus, Myconius easily errs. May the Lord be with him.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ with yours. Share everything about Karlstadt with Theodor, not with others, so that I am not called a gossip.</p>
      <p>Basel, January 14, 1542. Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>Gastius sends you all good wishes. He is from Zurich and was once my student; for this reason, he sought my advice on what he should do. I advised him to return to you; for he cannot be better advised than in his homeland. Therefore, if you find him worthy, please have him recommended.</p>
      <p>Again, farewell, etc.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the best and most learned man, in his Lord. Zurich.</p>
