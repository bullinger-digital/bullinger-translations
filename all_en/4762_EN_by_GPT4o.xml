      <p>S. I do not doubt that you have understood what happened in Baden and that the cause of the people of Glarus is in the best position. I would send a copy of the proposal made by the Pope's nuncio, if I did not think you already have it. There is much rumor about an alliance between the Pope, the Emperor, the King of Spain, and Savoy, and that the Five Cantons want to join them. The most honorable council of Zurich will not fail itself, nor will it reject any honest conditions and reasons offered by God for maintaining public peace and tranquility, according to its wisdom, so that I need not add anything to a matter that speaks for itself, and just as the Sabbath was made for man, so the laws of the times are not for men, etc. The King will be crowned in Reims on May 11 and will enter Paris with pomp on July 20.</p>
      <p>Great progress will be made daily for the word in France, and the fury of the false priests is being restrained. After writing this, I received letters from the Bishop of Rennes, written in Vienne on the 15th of this month, in which he writes that the matter of the council seems as uncertain to him as ever before. Something will be decided after the diet.</p>
      <p>God knows when it will be.</p>
      <p>War is beginning between the King of Poland and the Muscovite. So far his words.</p>
      <p>I have to thank the lords and consult them for having interposed their authority in the matter of interest or usury. But the people of Lucerne should owe them immense thanks and bear them, for if they had obeyed King Pfyffer, who was not unreasonably exacerbated, hardly anything could have been decided for many months. There are those who strive to bring misfortune and calamities upon themselves.</p>
      <p>They did not want to accept more than five here received four annually from royal generosity and want ten percent if I offer it humbly. These are the vices of this old world, which do not lack supporters and endorsers.</p>
      <p>A sharp doctor would be needed; but it is necessary to escape from their hands. Greet all the lords and friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, April 20.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, if yours.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
