    <p xml:id="regest1">Reports in the aftermath of a letter given to the Englishmen [Woodroffe and Butler] about the reception of the documents from the Diet of Schmalkalden, transmitted from Strasbourg, by the Zurich council: The position on the council and [Melanchthon's writing] on the primacy of the Pope and the jurisdiction of the bishops were received with joy, as was the conclusion of the Diet. Thanks to the leniency of Luther and especially Melanchthon, but also Cruciger and Jonas, the letter from the Swiss in Schmalkalden was received favorably; the opponents will gradually calm down. While the Zurich council would probably have already responded to Luther's unexpectedly friendly statement, if it were not first waiting for his letter announced by Melanchthon, the new articles presented by Bucer [No. 983] have caused astonishment. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I wrote through the Englishmen, venerable Myconius, but I did not mention a word about the matter which I am sure you most desire to know, how our actions at the Schmalkalden assembly and those sent from Strasbourg were received by the princes. The responses given to the emperor by the confederates regarding the Mantuan council were very well received. The additions concerning the primacy of the pope and the jurisdiction of the bishops were no less pleasing. The decree truly delighted everyone.</p>
      <p>The best among them praised the Lord. Indeed, He is to be praised forever, who has granted such freedom to His church and to the princely men. May God confirm what He has worked in them. They will give the greatest thanks with friendly insinuation.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, we learned that our exposition on the ministry of the word and sacraments was not displeasing to the princes and city delegates, but rather was very well received, and they will not demand anything more from us. They see that we have the right understanding of the supper, and that the contention among the learned is due to other unknown causes. They did not want to admit anything contentious and instructed the preachers gathered at the assembly not to bring forth anything contentious. Luther was candid in all things, as was Melanchthon above others. I also hear that Doctor Cruciger and Justus Jonas are wonderfully equitable and peaceful-minded men, not to mention many other good and learned men. However, there were many more turbulent minds, and if the others had obeyed them, I do not know what would have happened. And I have no doubt that our exposition did not satisfy them in all respects. But that matters little. It will dry up with time if we conduct ourselves peacefully and amicably. "Regarding the matter of concord," you ask, "what did the senate think when they heard what Doctor Luther said and what Bucer added on his own?" They had not expected such a friendly response from Luther. Hence, it was not entirely displeasing, and if he had not promised through Philipp to write shortly, a very friendly response would have easily been given to him. However, when Bucer's articulation and exhortation were added, many were astonished and said it was too officious. "For what purpose are those three articles needed," they said, "when we are expecting Luther's writing?" Indeed, it is strange for Bucer to prescribe new articles when he has just testified that he still does not know how our exposition pleases Luther or what he will write. In short: While Luther's speech was not displeasing, Bucer's writing was less pleasing. This is for you alone.</p>
      <p>Greet Grynaeus and farewell.</p>
      <p>May 25, 1537.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, most vigilant overseer of the Basel church, dearest brother.</p>
