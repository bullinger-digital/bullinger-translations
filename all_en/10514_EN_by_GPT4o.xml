    <p xml:id="regest1">The people of Zurich desire a unification of the churches. Therefore, Bucer asks them to secretly meet with him in the small town of Schaffhausen [Neunkirch] or in Tuttlingen or in Constance, along with [Ambrosius] Blarer, Grynäus Frecht, and a representative from each of the southern German cities. Since he must soon go to Hesse and wishes to meet [with Melanchthon] on December 15th, the people of Zurich should quickly decide on the location. The letter is sent via Lindau so that Thomas [Gaßner] can read it. He is to inform those from Constance, Isny, and Memmingen of the chosen location. The people of Constance should notify Blarer and Grynäus. He requests that the letter be forwarded to Berchtold [Haller] and Myconius and to remain discreet.</p>

      <p>I know, brothers, that you seek the unification of the churches of Christ. Now, if I were to die at this moment, I would die in this faith, that they truly agree, and there is hope that I can prove this to you with the help of the Lord. Therefore, I beseech and implore you through the Lord Jesus: Dedicate yourselves to the body of our Lord Jesus Christ and grant me the opportunity to meet you either in that small town, which is Neunkirch, a mile from Schaffhausen towards the domain of Count Schwyz, or in Tuttlingen in the Duchy of Württemberg, where the Lord of Hewen is now the governor, in whichever place you prefer, or if you prefer, in Constance. Perhaps a way can be found for us to meet secretly. For it is absolutely necessary for our meeting to remain hidden. It is necessary to meet with Blarer, Grynaeus, Frecht, one from Augsburg, Memmingen, Kempten, Lindau, Isny, and Esslingen. An opportunity for concord is offered, which I do not doubt we will not reject without great offense to God. Respond through this same messenger, and promptly. For I expect that I must go to Hesse. The day of our meeting should be December 15th. You designate the place at your discretion, where you two can meet quietly.</p>
      <p>Farewell and, I pray through Christ, allow yourselves to be prepared, and to meet and respond promptly, and that through this same messenger, who will deliver this letter to you. Commend me to the brothers.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, November 22nd.</p>
      <p>I sent this letter to you via Lindau and wanted our Thomas to read it there, who can also announce your response to those from Constance, Isny, and Memmingen regarding the place where you will have replied, indeed to the people of Constance, Blarer, and Grynaeus.</p>
      <p>Martin Bucer.</p>
      <p>I earnestly beseech you, if you can, to send this letter to Berchtold in time with the indication of the place where you wish to meet, so that if they wish, the people of Bern may also attend the meeting. Thus I pray, and take care to send letters to Myconius as well, indicating the place where you wish to meet. I ask you to handle everything discreetly and with diligence through the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>November 22nd.</p>
