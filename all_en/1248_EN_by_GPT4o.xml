      <p>Greetings. I have nothing to write except that my Zoilus, that harsh and proud Valentinus, the most confident preacher of the antichristian religion, died on the 19th of April. I suppose he is now complaining to Pluto, his ruler on earth, about the stubbornness of the people of Konstanz, because some, alas too few, continue to oppose his ravings and disregard his threats. When he returns, how many bulls of royal decrees do you think he will bring? I am greatly amazed that in such a small number of the sheep of Konstanz, there is so much rejoicing over this death. If he did not sin unto death, I wholeheartedly wish him a happy departure, and for the country, a better bishop.</p>
      <p>Today, an Italian from Mirandola was with me, who stayed for some time in St. Gallen, having been recommended there from Italy as someone who is compelled to live in exile for the cause of Christ. However, the merchants of St. Gallen thought he could more successfully apply his craft in making silk hats and purses there than in St. Gallen. Fortmüller recommended him to me in his letters, which you will receive here; some other good men also recommended him, especially Jakob Reutlinger here, who will present these to you, so that I may diligently commend this good young man to you, which I hope you will consider I have done with these few words. He is completely unknown to me, but he is well known to those who have recommended him with such faith; he seems, by his appearance and demeanor, to carry an uncommon honesty. If you can, please assist him so that he may have the means to live there by the work of his hands and not be forced to burden anyone.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new to write, except that some confidently affirm that the council has been moved to Bologna by the Pope. If you have any certain information, I beg you to inform me briefly.</p>
      <p>It is written with great applause from the enemy's camp that the people of Magdeburg are so surrounded and besieged with such violence that they will be forced to surrender to the enemy within a few days. I believe none of this unless I hear it from more trustworthy witnesses. May the Lord preserve you, my brother, eternally with your whole household, with whom commend me and mine diligently and perpetually to Christ. Farewell. In Winterthur, on the 23rd of April, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable friend and brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
