      <p>The grace of Christ be with you.</p>
      <p>Our master Georg, in a letter sent to me last month, most esteemed Bullinger in Christ, entrusted certain matters to me and at the same time instructed me to advise you and Sulzer towards the sacramental reconciliation (as they call it). I wish I were as learned as I am willing, so that I could calm the fury and slanders of the opposing party with holy allurements, which have raged against the truth like a frenzied Corybant. But each person has their own will, and I am quite weak in repelling these injuries.</p>
      <p>I believe that we must incessantly implore and beseech the most good and great God not to abandon the cause of His Son. How often reconciliation has been attempted, you know better than I; but what have we achieved? Namely, that the adversaries have always had a greater opportunity for discord and slander. Also, how grossly, not to say impiously, they have disputed about the sacred institution of Christ until now is known to everyone, as the saying goes. For they make a new idol out of the memory of Christ.</p>
      <p>In sum: as many heads as there are among them, so many opinions, and the more someone wishes to appear learned, the more they cling to their own sense and stubbornly defend it, etc. I, a wretched man now singing my swan song, do not care for nor will I be moved by their cavils. For Christ is the truth, etc.</p>
      <p>I have taught and presided over the churches of Christ, promoting true piety with my fellow brothers to the best of my ability. I have never denied that Christ is present in His action and institution if it is celebrated according to His command, and that His body and blood are the food and drink of the soul. For who would say (unless insane) that Christ and His flesh are food for the body or stomach? Furthermore, we have refrained from unknown terms invented outside of Scripture, such as substantially, naturally, corporally, not to mention, as some assert, even carnally, etc. Westphal is crude.</p>
      <p>Even though I am scarcely worth a penny, I advise you to accept and enter into this reconciliation, if it is attempted, so that nothing is taken away from the truth and the glory of Christ, etc. But what am I, a pig to Minerva, and what do I, so small, teach the Spirit of God speaking through the Scriptures by you, etc.</p>
      <p>Perhaps I, delirious, have written to you more freely or, if you prefer, with greater rashness than is proper; take it in good part. As for me: I live and die daily almost useless to the church of God, for there are three most troublesome ones perpetually lying in wait, one is the altar, the other two are the months Winter and Summer, in which my health is bad or, if you prefer, well. These are the news from Augsburg since the feast of Martin: They say the Duke of Alba offered peace to the Pope through the intercession of the Venetians, but the Pope refused and accuses the Emperor and his brother of infidelity and invades the patrimony of Peter, etc. The French, having sent an envoy, renounced the truce made with the father to Philip the son, unless he ceases to harass the Pope. To which Philip replied that he too is prepared to defend the violated faith, etc.</p>
      <p>The Diet at Regensburg requests the assembly to be moved to Augsburg for the convenience of lodgings and the abundance of provisions. The king refuses; he prefers it closer to the Austrians and incursions, as he claims... Otto Henry of the Palatinate has obtained the house of the prefecture of Hagenau, which many affirm to be true. Certainly, if this is so, there will be those who also hope for the Colmar and Sélestat people to embrace... They say the Emperor has resigned the imperial regalia, namely the crown and scepter, through messengers to his brother and the electors.</p>
      <p>If this is true, we will see a new creation. Doctor Ludwig Rabus has privately dealt with the senators about something: it is certain that he left for Ulm a few weeks ago and there took up ministry. This from Theobald Schwarz.</p>
      <p>The rest, about which I do not wish to write, will be indicated by your son, etc. Farewell in Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>There was no time to reread on Christ's nativity due to business and the phlegm, which greatly troubles me. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>In Riquewihr on Christ's nativity 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Erb.</p>
      <p>If through these drivers, perhaps more copious... To the most excellent man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant Antistes of the church of Zürich, etc.</p>
