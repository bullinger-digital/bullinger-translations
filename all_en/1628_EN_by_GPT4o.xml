      <p>Greetings. Although I do not write to you frequently, I can certainly assure you that my feelings towards you remain unchanged, as they have always been, which I could prove with many reasons if I deemed it necessary. For your remarkable virtue and excellent doctrine deserve the perpetual favor of all good people, and it is fitting for honorable men to wisely choose whom they love and to steadfastly maintain their friendship. And if these disturbances of war had not kept me at home, I had planned to visit you, so that after prolonged labor, I might refresh my weary spirit through your company. But I must remain at my post and face the danger with the republic, which seems to threaten unless it is averted from us by the grace of God. Therefore, when the young man Paulus Fagius, son of the most learned and honorable Fagius, was about to set out for Zürich, I decided to write you a brief letter to renew our old friendship and to commend the young man to you. He came a few days ago from England, where he devoted himself to studies; from him, you will be able to learn about the state of that kingdom, which perhaps is not indicated by the letters of others. And since our schools are not very frequented, by the advice of friends, he wished to go to your school, so that he might be instructed there in the doctrine of letters and religion. Therefore, you will ensure, according to your innate piety, that he is placed in some good location where he can greatly advance in letters and piety. He would like to reside with Mr. Gwalter, whom I believe will not reluctantly grant him a place in his house. What is happening here, you will learn from the young man, and if God permits some tranquility, I will either come to you or write more extensively.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I only say this: what you once wrote to me in Basel about Frisius, the prophecies were very true; but I was deceived by the appearance of piety, which I thought was in the man, when experience taught me that nothing was more impious than he. Greet on my behalf Mr. Pellican, Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Gesner, Lelius, and the other friends. Farewell. Strasbourg, the second day of May 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Francisco Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the word of God. In Zürich.</p>
      <p>The last of Mr. Francisco Dryander, the Spaniard.</p>
