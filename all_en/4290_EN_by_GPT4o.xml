      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, most esteemed lord and dearest brother, and read them gladly.</p>
      <p>However, I do not want you to doubt anything about our stable agreement and brotherhood. May the Lord strengthen concord and love among all the ministers of His church and dispel quarrels and hatreds! Our Philippus passed away to the Lord on April 19th; before him, on January 8th, our Lascus fell asleep in the Lord; and unless I am mistaken, our Bernardinus will follow them in these days. But when will we follow them, my lord?</p>
      <p>I understand from the writings of this nobleman what is happening in the Polish churches. Stancarus is disturbing them.</p>
      <p>We approve the confession of the Polish ministers, and we disapprove of Stancarus's doctrine about the mediator according to only the human nature. We assert that Christ is our mediator according to both natures; for the actions of Christ refer to the person, in which, although there are two unmixed natures, they are nevertheless again indivisible. Many letters had to be written to Poland and a common writing about the mediator had to be requested, which is why I am briefer in these matters.</p>
      <p>We are very concerned about your safety; for much is said here about the dangers threatening you from the King of the French and the Savoyard. We hope the Lord will not fail you, which we earnestly and continually pray for from Him. You will not perform a useless task if you diligently ensure that letters are written to us from time to time about your affairs and those of the French; for it will benefit both us and you, who are brothers, if we are not unaware of the common danger and what is happening. Greet all the brothers in the Lord; all of ours greet you, and especially mine.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich, May 27th, in the year of our Lord 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
