      <p>Our dear Burkhard, whose misfortune I lament, caught me under the table, dearest Heinrich. I did not want him to return to you empty-handed. I will come to Zofingen on the Wednesday after Easter, the last day of March, hoping to meet either you (oh God, how I wish not in vain!) or Leo. Whoever comes, let him have this hope from me that I will act according to the rule of charity and faith.</p>
      <p>Oh Heinrich, such great indignation and offense from the council now threatens me, that unless it changes, it would be better for me to leave than to remain longer. How I wish to use your advice in these matters! Either I fear too much for my feelings or it will be necessary to ensure that there is not so much freedom to slander ministers even among the most evangelical senators. When you come, I will discuss it in person; if not, I am forced to commend it to you in writing.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>On Easter Day in the year 35.</p>
      <p>Your B. Haller.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
