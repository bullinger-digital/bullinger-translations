      <p>Greetings. Yesterday, as night was falling and I was away from home, our messenger, who brought our council's decision on discipline to you, returned and brought your letters. However, I do not understand what you are responding to the senate. I suspect, however, that you have withheld your response.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I ask, as before, that you use your authority with our people. For it will be very effective if they understand that you agree with us.</p>
      <p>I would also like Mr. Calvin to agree in the meantime: but you will also achieve this with your authority.</p>
      <p>He is so disliked by many of our people that anything originating from him is unpleasant to them.</p>
      <p>However, I do not doubt that he, in his piety and prudence, will easily overlook this for the glory of the Lord and the salvation of the churches. I entrust everything to your prudence and pray to the Lord that He may arrange everything for the best and lead it to a happy conclusion. Indeed, it would be very useful for you to establish something solid that posterity could follow; otherwise, if the matter is left undecided by you, the most illustrious lights of the church and our age, and passed on to posterity, I foresee great disturbances arising.</p>
      <p>I know indeed what Mr. Martyr, Mr. Calvin, Viret, Bucer, and others write about this matter; but it is one thing to simply write and another to bring the matter into effect. So many difficulties and various cases arise that I would like the path to be laid out in such a way that it is a tolerable and edifying method, one that everyone would agree on and follow, although I am not unaware that the same form cannot be maintained in all churches, but must be acted upon according to their diversity and convenience, which will always be edifying.</p>
      <p>However, there are some common things that could be reconciled. I say otherwise, if it must be said from the heart, we are in a situation where the matter could be put into practice, and it would proceed just like in Basel; there they have been dealing with it for a long time, but it is still a mess. This is for you.</p>
      <p>From Glarus, Amman Bäldi writes to me: I communicated these things to the consul and the senate, and today this matter will be dealt with seriously. Meanwhile, our people have written again to yours and would like very much for action to be taken; it always seems to us that you have people who are very slow.</p>
      <p>I sense nothing else among our people than that they would like to finally speak plainly with those people who think that heaven and earth depend on them. Now I know well that nothing is gained from you; but where it falls, I also know well.</p>
      <p>May God improve it. Amen.</p>
      <p>These things hastily and in great haste.</p>
      <p>Therefore, forgive me.</p>
      <p>Give my regards to those you command.</p>
      <p>They greet you in return.</p>
      <p>Give my regards to all the fellow ministers, as well as to your wife and family.</p>
      <p>Bern, February 20, 1562.</p>
      <p>I commend to you our Gislinger, who brings this letter.</p>
      <p>He is still paying the penalties for a youth spent somewhat lightly; meanwhile, however, he conducts himself moderately well. Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zürich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
