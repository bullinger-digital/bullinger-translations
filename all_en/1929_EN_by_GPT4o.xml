      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Our Celius, most distinguished man, a person endowed with singular learning and humanity and a friend of both of us, so that he would not travel to you without my letters, it pleased me to give you these, in which I would show that your goodwill towards me is very pleasing to me, which you declare by the fact that you hardly write any letters to the friends you have here without making a loving mention of me. If I did not value your testimony about me, as it comes from a reputable man, I would be very ungrateful to you and unfair to myself. Furthermore, since a certain writing by Brentius has recently been published, in which he attempts to reconcile Osiander with the theologians of Prussia and Saxony, I wanted to let you know that you would do me a favor if you informed me whether Brentius's effort is approved by you; for from the beginning they seemed to me to be more disputing over words than over matters. Farewell, most illustrious man, and keep our Celius recommended. I bid all yours to be well. July 17.</p>
      <p>Your Martin Borrhaus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the church of ZÃ¼rich, his brother in the Lord.</p>
