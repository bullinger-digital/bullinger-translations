      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, etc. This recently held assembly has ended with nothing else than that it has been postponed to another day, now set for Bartholomew's Day, on which the king's envoy has promised to bring sufficient assurance of everything promised to the communities. As the Milanese delegation has noted, they are not for the League, but have hurried back to Milan without leave. Some consider this not a good sign, since the governor has allowed himself to inspect our passes, etc.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, my dear master Heinrich, I have a very friendly request, if it is not inconvenient for you: I have a 14-year-old son who has studied so far, named Titus; I would like to make him a barber and a surgeon, of which we are in great need here in the whole country. If you could perhaps speak with a reputable and earnest master, and what he would take for a year, or as is the custom in some places, year by year. For I would like, if possible, to save the costs; I have otherwise a heavy household to maintain at the door along with the expenses, which I have managed so far with my Paul. Nevertheless, if it cannot be otherwise, I will honestly fulfill what you advise me and promise in my name to the trustworthy people, half the wages, so that half a year is over, the rest at the end of the year. I ask you for a friendly reply, with the assurance that I am very willing to serve you in this and similar matters according to my ability.</p>
      <p>Besides, I have nothing at present worthy of your knowledge, except that I commend myself to you. Farewell through the Lord, who may deign to preserve you for a long time. Amen.</p>
      <p>In haste, June 16, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Blasius, as little as he is.</p>
      <p>To the true, learned, and pious Lord Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the most ample church of Zurich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
