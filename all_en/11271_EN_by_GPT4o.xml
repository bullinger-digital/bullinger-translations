    <p xml:id="regest1">Encourages Travers to promote science and scholars for the benefit of the state and church, as their disdain destroys laws, weakens the state, and causes churches to perish. The Roman Church, for example, was able to establish its cult throughout the West within two centuries thanks to schools and monasteries; therefore, schools must now be established to help true religion and justice prevail. Asks Travers to do everything in his power to establish and maintain them. Sends greetings to Anton Travers.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. The piety and humanity, most illustrious man, which all good people praise in you and give thanks to God, the sole giver of all good things, have led me to begin writing this letter to you. I wish to encourage you in the Lord, to continue diligently and always to do what you are already doing, namely to favor piety, letters, and the learned. I am not speaking here of certain boastful and foolish scholars, whose learning benefits no one, not even themselves, who possess it; but I speak of those who have joined holy love of God and neighbor to their knowledge and therefore wish to benefit all, harm no one, who promote the glory of the Savior and beloved Lord Jesus Christ, teach justice and innocence, consistently pass on true religion, and fight, overthrow, and suppress injustice, crimes, lust, and superstition. For from this, we see the safety of kingdoms, the salvation of many people, and glory and immortal life arise. Again, taught by experience, we certainly know that through neglect and contempt of letters and the learned, laws perish, republics wither, and entire churches are ruined. The advisors of the Roman pontiff saw this several centuries ago, namely that the religion and rites of the Roman Church could not be transferred to the kingdoms of the West unless schools were established, from which would emerge those who would incline the minds of people with laws, sermons, and evident speeches. Therefore, colleges and monasteries were established, from which emerged men skilled in the arts and equipped to speak and persuade, who in one or two centuries subjected the entire West to the Roman chair. Unless we are insane and wish to be ungrateful to Christ the Redeemer, we will also restore schools in our century, in which the arts are indeed soberly and above all the divine purity of biblical religion is diligently taught to the youth. From these, without a doubt, after some years, will emerge those who will accuse superstition and all injustice and ensure that it is condemned and exiled, and again those who will preserve the homeland safe and the churches most pleasing to Christ with the doctrine of true religion and justice. You see, with your prudence, how much good those who restore letters and support the learned bring to the homeland and the church. Now indeed, you are not unaware of what you can do among your people, nor do you not know what you ought to do. What then remains but that you turn with all your might and all your resources to restoring and preserving studies? For He lives, He lives eternally, who has prepared a laurel for you for this most beautiful and honorable endeavor of yours. May the Lord Jesus keep you. ZÃ¼rich, February 21, 1539. Greet Anton Travers.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Johannes Travers, a foremost man among the Rhaetians, his most esteemed lord.</p>
