      <p>Greetings and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>From the letters of our Calvin, you will learn how unjustly and slanderously, that is, in what manner those act who have proposed to overthrow an innocent man by any means. But the Lord lives, who sees all these things and will undoubtedly defend the cause of the oppressed. Here indeed in the city, there is such peace and concord, such a gathering to hear the word of God, such testimonies of piety and religion, that even these alone clearly declare that the devil, along with those exiles who now try to move heaven and earth, has cast himself out of the town, since all is calm within, but wherever they go, they bring quarrels and discord with them. If anyone were to look into their ways and even their present life, that alone would have enough weight to ensure that they are not only not listened to but also handed over to their republic for punishment. But somehow it happens that they are allowed to fabricate anything with impunity, and others accept any monstrous lies as oracles. What the outcome will be, time will tell. In the meantime, we must more and more devote ourselves to prayer so that the Lord may turn this storm away from the heads of his people and onto the authors of these evils.</p>
      <p>As for us, unless it were not only not miserable but even glorious to be afflicted with the good, I would think that Virgil's verse was prophesied about us: "Mantua, alas, too close to wretched Cremona." For, lest you be unaware, anything is allowed against us too, and, to put it in one word, we are considered Calvinists, which is a much greater crime than if you were to combine all other crimes into one. Certainly, nothing is proclaimed or punished as severely. What do you think will happen? Namely, that the Lord will either soon change the minds of many or entrust his vineyard to other farmers from whom he will receive fruit in due time. I indeed eagerly await the day when I will have to depart from this Babylon as well, not out of hatred for anyone or a misguided desire for greater leisure (so help me God!), but rather out of compassion for those who do not cease to provoke God in themselves and therefore bring certain ruin upon themselves, of which I, if possible, would not even want to be a witness. But yet, I hope this storm will not take us away or prevent us from standing firmly in our station as long as it pleases the Lord. It seemed right to me to pour these things into your bosom, partly to cast out this sadness from my mind to some extent, partly because I expect great comfort and relief from your concern for us and your prayers. But enough of these matters. I turn to other things.</p>
      <p>Our Hotomanus, to whom I entrusted letters to be delivered to Vergerius, upon returning assured me that he had deposited them with you. Vergerius wrote back these days that they were indeed delivered to him, but found by chance in Schaffhausen, and indeed alone in someone's hands after they had wandered for some time. Therefore, he advises that I exercise greater caution in these matters. I thought it right to warn you of this so that you too may be vigilant here. For although we write nothing that we are not prepared to defend openly, you can hardly believe how many there are who lie in wait to intercept our letters, so impudently indeed that they are not ashamed to enter even into the innermost places to steal letters written in a familiar manner, which they then display to stir up envy against good men. However, in those letters to Vergerius, I wrote that I could not sufficiently marvel that he embraced a man, of all those I had ever heard of, most impious, to the extent that he even wanted him to be close to him. And I added many things in that sense from which he himself might understand how impiously he thought about the chief and first head of religion, that is, about God himself. What this is, I will say briefly: which I indeed did not understand from the man's own mouth, but I learned from letters written in his own hand, so that he cannot deny it even if he wishes. He considers God to be a common name, by which a certain common nature of three individuals is signified, so that just as man is divided into Peter, Paul, and John, so God is divided into Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. From which he explicitly concludes that it is no more absurd to say there are three gods than to say there are three men, although there is one nature of God just as there is of man. Then he confuses the natures of Christ in such a way that, not content with criticizing the communication, he even attacks it with insults. But what is it to think and speak impiously if this is not it? For he who makes multiple gods certainly removes God himself from the equation, and he who does not distinguish the natures of Christ, what hope of salvation does he leave us? Vergerius responds that before he left you, he satisfied you on these matters, and he also reproaches me for having attacked a good man so harshly. I wish to know what this is about. For if he satisfied you, I will indeed rejoice and congratulate you for having brought the man back to the right path: if not, I will not cease to warn Vergerius to consult the church of God. But I suspect, not without reason, which I wish my suspicion would prove false, that the man, more cunning than necessary, to look after his own affairs, pretended something for the time being. For unless he satisfied you since you saw our Hotomanus, he is the same as he was before, as he openly confirmed the same impiety at that very time with the utmost impudence and obstinate defiance. I do not disclose the man's name. He is a jurist, I wish he were sufficiently skilled in law. In France, Pharaoh rages, elated by new successes. On the 12th of this month, in our vicinity, namely in Cambrai, five excellent brothers were hanged and burned, two of whom were of singular piety and uncommon learning. Our princes indeed interceded, but in vain. But it is well that they professed Christ most steadfastly to their last breath, so much so that even the common people murmured against the judges. But listen to what will rightly cheer you in this harshness of the times. The Frenchman, to leave nothing undone in extreme cruelty, assigned jurisdiction to a certain monk, already known to all for his wickedness, similar to that Spanish Inquisition. When he brought the royal edict to the Parisian senate in the usual manner, written in such a way that it should be confirmed by the senate's decree, the senate replied that the king seemed to them to have been deceived by trickery, and that they could neither confirm such edicts with their authority nor should they. Four cardinals are sent to Paris to understand the reasons for this rejection. To them, as we learned from a reliable source, it was answered so strongly and prudently that they had nothing to object to. We hear, among other things, that two presidents, who spoke on behalf of the senate, also added this, that they had resolved to renounce their senatorial office rather than serve the cruelty of the pontiff, and that they had henceforth decided to consider the crime of heresy much more carefully, since most of those accused of this name are neither seditious nor tainted with any crimes. Now the outcome of this contention is awaited. I can indeed affirm to you that there is hardly any village in France now where some fruit of the gospel does not appear, and already in several more famous cities, where fires blaze daily, churches have been established, where the word is purely taught in common assembly and the sacraments are administered, and ecclesiastical discipline is received and practiced, which we cannot even name here without sacrilege. This is indeed what incites Satan and his faithful ministers against this particular church. For since he sees that his cruelty achieves nothing among the French themselves (thanks be to God), he hopes that if he obstructs this as a source, from which now indeed the whole of France is chiefly irrigated, it will soon be that all the streams will dry up. But the Lord, as I hope, will hinder these efforts of Satan and crush all his enemies.</p>
      <p>I come to that noble boy about whom you wrote to me. Concerning my willingness, have this in brief. There is nothing in my power, my father, that I would not willingly and freely do for your sake. But there are some things I must warn you about. My lodging for receiving students, and especially the heating, is very cramped, my wife is almost perpetually ill, and I have almost no leisure from lectures and daily occupations. But yet, if it seems right to you, and the boy is such that he prefers to follow right counsel rather than the corrupt manners of many, no difficulty will prevent me from most willingly obliging you, and I will strive, as far as possible, to fulfill my duty. If not, I have a neighbor, Franciscus Beraldus, the son of that Nicolaus Beraldus, whose name you have at least read in Erasmus's "Ciceronianus," a man of truly remarkable piety and learning and most amiable manners, than whom I could not have sought a more suitable teacher even in the French language. You now decide what seems to be in the boy's best interest. For, as I said before and repeat again from the heart, you can and should promise yourself everything from me that can proceed from me. I dare to promise you the same from Beraldus himself, although he is absent and completely unaware of what I am writing to you. For I had come here to our Calvin, from whose house I wrote this to you, when your letters were delivered to me by our Leverus, whom I indeed loved before for his merit, but now love even more because he has been commended to me by you. As for the annual pension, since I do not know whether the boy will come alone or with a companion, and I also do not know how liberally he wishes to be treated, I cannot determine anything certain, especially since it seems to us that a great scarcity of wine is impending. Just know this, about which you do not doubt, I think, that no profit is sought here by us, but this one thing, that we may also in this part approve our faith to the church and friends. You therefore decide whatever you know to be fair. If you prefer that we do it, I will do it familiarly when he comes, and I will have learned those previous things from you. Farewell, most excellent man, and most worthy of my respect for your merit. May the Lord Jesus bless you more and more and keep you safe for his church. I ask you to greet both your sons-in-law with D. Gualther and Gesner, and the other best and most esteemed brothers in my name as courteously as possible and commend to them the peace of our churches. Farewell again. Geneva, October 22, 1555.</p>
      <p>Th. Beza, your most devoted son in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich. In Zürich.</p>
