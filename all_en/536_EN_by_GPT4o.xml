      <p>Greetings. I have attributed your silence during this most calamitous time to your occupations, as you have not written for such a long interval; but you mention an illness, which I was indeed unaware of. For while you were silent, no one from there wrote to me; I do not know how it happens, but everyone has forgotten me; they do not know with what familiarity, nay, even friendship we once lived together, they have completely cast me out of their minds, while in the meantime they have said more than once, while they still wrote, that it is not a matter of argument for them, for you with your diligence anticipate everything. Why then did they not write when you were ill? Therefore, there must be another reason why they are cautious, whatever that may be. "But," you say, "you have not written to us for quite a while either." The answer is at hand: While you are silent, I am in doubt as to what I should do; moreover, arguments occur less frequently since Strasbourg has failed. Bucer and Vagius have been forced to leave for England, where they are now active. Dr. Hedio, Dasypodius, Theobaldus Nigri, and the rest are silent. Therefore, I am completely ignorant of what is being done by the Emperor, Philip, and others; however, Theobaldus wrote three days ago in this manner: the bishop is pressing vehemently that they finally establish the Interim of the Emperor's masters, which was accepted long ago; indeed, the senate refuses, and they have obtained from the Emperor that the bishop should do it, not themselves; but the bishop and his followers fear for themselves, lest if they attempt anything here, the populace will hardly permit it. He has therefore prescribed the following articles: 1. that all clergy should be emancipated from the city's jurisdiction and freed from the city's law; 2. that in each church they should build three altars, one in the choir, two in the outer temple. Once these are completed, he himself will come to consecrate the altars and reconcile the churches. 3. That they should allow the collation and provision of parishes to be arranged by the ordinary collators, namely the colleges, who will depose the current unwilling preachers according to the Interim and substitute others. However, the senate prudently responded, indicating that they know by what right or wrong they are asking, and with what spirit he is affected by this matter; thus the matter is being drawn out, and the good are expecting redemption from heaven. So much for these matters.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Florianus wrote here these days from Strasbourg, where he has been staying, that the Emperor is gathering cavalry armies in three places in Lower Germany and that Philip is to be inaugurated there, then that the Emperor's illness will bring some great evil to Germany, also that he greatly fears for the maritime cities, because they have no alliance among themselves; for that deceiver is so treacherous that it can hardly be that he will not bring some grave evil. However, I hear from others: that they are strong and fearless and have both infantry and cavalry ready. I also hear from those who have come here directly from Portugal through Antwerp and Lower Germany these days, among whom is the son of Holbein the painter, who died long ago in England.</p>
      <p>He also wrote that the island of Zapho, situated opposite Spain and Portugal, has been occupied by 50,000 Moorish horsemen, which until now has been such that the Spaniards could not do without it for trade and other matters. The Spaniards are very frightened by this, and the Emperor is moved to have in mind to send some German banners.</p>
      <p>Finally, he indicates that the Emperor has asked the Roman pontiff to give him Piacenza, while he retains the fortress (or vice versa, for I read it carelessly), until it is legally decided to whom the city should belong. Then the county around Genoa, of him who incited the tumult against the Emperor's ships in the Genoese port last year, to the pope's nephew, if the pope, in turn, pays three hundred thousand ducats. He also asks that the pope separate the illegitimate daughter of the King of France, joined in marriage to the said nephew, from her husband and henceforth have no friendship, no alliance with the French or enter into one. See, my Bullinger, what Satan is preparing among men through that deceitful one; for in all these things he seeks nothing else but to finally satisfy his ambition, that is, to become a god in Europe.</p>
      <p>In England, he says everything is going well. The Mass has been abolished, justification is taught purely, yet some ceremonies still remain and care for the dead. Through the intercession of John a Lasco, a place has been given to the Germans in London, to the French outside London, and the war is beginning to rekindle between the French and the English.</p>
      <p>Regarding the French alliance, I will say one word: the alliance itself cannot displease me in this tempest, just as annual and private pensions cannot please; for I know, if anyone knows, what evils they have brought to Switzerland. Therefore, I am pleased with the Sylvanians and the Valaisians, because they approve the alliance, exclude pensions in such a way that they even shudder at the name, especially the Valaisians; for a serious tumult arose among them because of this in recent days. What I say about the alliance, I refer to the present time, as I know that among the enemies no greater joy, nay, even hope against us can arise than if they can hear that the action of the alliance has perished. In recent weeks there have been foreign men here, for no other reason than to hear what might be conjectured about it. If anyone were to say that the Frenchman is an impious man, etc., what would he say about our people, who have sought us in war for that reason and still bear such minds towards us for Christ, as we know.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with all yours and consider this last thing favorably. Basel, May 29, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, brother in the Lord, to be cherished. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
