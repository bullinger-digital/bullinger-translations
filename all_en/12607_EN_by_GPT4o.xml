    <p xml:id="regest1">Just as Haller began writing this letter, [Hans] Vogler [the Elder] brought Bullinger's letter [No. 2543] and the [„Relatio fidelis“] by Theodor [Bibliander].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Bullinger reprimanded Haller in a marginal note [not preserved] of his letter for not choosing [Georg] Frölich as the godfather for his little son [Johannes]. However, Frölich, together with an honorable woman [...], lifted the child from the baptism. Thus, he is a godfather! This is evidenced by the verses to which he added a Rhenish guilder. Hans Vogler [on the other hand], who arrived in Augsburg only after the baptism and also wanted to become a godfather, is therefore only an "adopted" godfather.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Haller does not yet know what Bullinger wrote to Frölich about the [Catholic] places of the Confederation. Certainly, not all of them bow to Baal, but the state of their communities is dire! In Augsburg, several mercenaries from the Five Places serve in the city garrison. Today, Haller was invited to the wedding of a man from Uri [...], together with two people from Schwyz, a person from Glarus, a person from Bern, a person from St. Gallen, and two people from Zurich, a person from Zug, and some people from Toggenburg. Haller admonished them to true piety and to recognize their blindness. However, they already show penitence by offering their help to the [Schmalkaldic League] against their fellow believers. They explain the stubbornness of their own solely with the [Second Kappel] War. As for themselves, they would be ready to promote the [Protestant] faith. May Haller still experience a Switzerland united in faith!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Haller thanks for Bibliander's [„Relatio fidelis“], in which many people in Augsburg are interested. The money for it should be taken by Bullinger from the two crowns that Haller lent to [Hans Hug and Meinrat Oggenfuß]. If they have not handed over the money to Bullinger, Haller will pay the amount himself.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Haller will translate the dedication to the commentary on Luke into German as desired.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Haller has already written about [Hans Wilpert] Zoller in his previous letter [No. 2548]. Since [his recovery], Zoller has participated in several skirmishes. Although a prostitute gave rise to the dispute, the matter is said to have played out differently than told, to discredit Zoller. [Sebastian Schertlin], who still holds Zoller in high regard, was very worried about him. Eight days ago, Haller wrote to the governor of Kyburg [Bernhard von Cham] about this. Bullinger will have delivered the letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- If Haller wrote less last month, it was because Vogler recorded everything precisely.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Frölich may write more about the current events. Here only this: Even though Emperor [Charles V] escaped the [Schmalkaldic] army through a ruse, it was able to regain a favorable position thanks to great effort, as Haller already described in his letters of the 24th [No. 2548] and 26th of August [No. 2551]. Now the army is pressing the Emperor hard. It was divided into four units: under Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony], Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse], Schertlin, and [Johann] von Heideck. On the evening of August 26, about 300 riders from the Landgrave's camp attacked several hundred Spaniards and Italians. They captured 60 saddles, took 15 prisoners, and drove the rest into flight. Among the prisoners is a significant military leader who wore a fine linen surcoat over his armor, with a silver key [as a coat of arms] depicted on the golden sleeve. Some claim it is [Ottavio Farnese], the Duke of Camerino and nephew of the Pope [Paul III], others, a Roman patrician. The prisoners confessed that the Emperor is waiting for his army from the Netherlands to arrive, and that he therefore had a fortified camp built. This is now being besieged by the [Schmalkaldic League]. On the Hessian side, only one nobleman [Christof von Bodenhausen] fell.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- There are daily skirmishes. On August 28, Italians or Spaniards attacked [Schmalkaldic] guards and killed about 20 men, including the standard-bearer [...] of the military leader [Johann] von Heideck. They then retreated to the village [Gerolfing]. On [August 29], Schertlin set the village on fire and thus drove the [Imperials] out. In the process, some [Schmalkaldic] and more than 200 [Imperials] were killed. Schertlin's horse was shot. He himself survived.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- To promote the Gospel and to prove that this war is not just about conquering foreign territories, the Reformation is being introduced in the churches of the Diocese of Augsburg. In Augsburg, however, there are only eight pastors, some of whom have already been tasked with reforming these churches. Due to the lack of pastors, the councilors are now sending a letter with this messenger [...] requesting Zurich pastors. Bullinger should support this request [with the Zurich council], as this would provide more [Zwinglian-oriented] pastors in Augsburg and finally change the notorious [church] order! Once the supply of pastors is secured, the forces sent from Zurich would be allowed to return; which Haller also hopes for himself. It is very important that the poor, though happy (because freed from the Antichrist) churches are not abandoned in the current [war emergency]! [Utz] Eckstein and H[ans] Kopf from Dietikon (a relative of the mayor [Johannes] Haab) would be suitable for Kaufbeuren (they do not want [Johannes Ramp, pastor] in Wildberg, who is a native of Kaufbeuren). In addition, the poor Jakob Schnyder from Wangen, who limps but is steadfast in teaching, would be a candidate. Also to be considered is Gallus [Glatthaar], pastor in Bubikon, who was formerly in the monastery of Ochsenhausen; among the younger ones, Bernhard Lindauer and [...] Ininger. Bullinger should (if he has no objection) promote the latter. Haller has compassion for him, although he does not know him well. One should also think of [Rudolf Schwyzer the Younger], whose father [Rudolf the Elder] was Haller's predecessor in Illnau and who is now in Richterswil. [Konrad] Hofherr is also called by [Jakob] Herbrot, his patron. Among others, Johannes Hirz would also be a candidate. The candidates do not need to be particularly learned, as long as they are pious, solid in teaching, and of good conduct. They will not be entrusted with the reformation [in the diocese]. However, Haller will take care of them [in the city] so that they do not do anything clumsy. He will, in turn, advocate for a [proper] education [in Augsburg] so that the churches receive suitable successors.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- [Michael] Keller is a good man, but he does not devote himself enough to study. [Wolfgang] Musculus is troubled by the [Lutheran colleagues].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Bullinger should exert his influence!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Haller is now hurrying to Frölich to also read the letter addressed to him by Bullinger [not preserved].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- Vadian and [Ambrosius] Blarer have written to Haller several times.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, Theodor [Bibliander], [Rudolf] Gwalther (from whom Haller expects the portrait of Zwingli) and to the whole family. Greetings from Sixt [Birck], the author of the pasquinade [„Ain neüwer Römischer Pasquillus von dem Bapst“], which Frölich will send.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ. Just as I was about to begin writing this letter, Vogler arrived bringing your letter along with the book by Dr. Theodor. I will first respond to your letter and then add what I was otherwise going to write.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>You admonish in the margin of your letter that I acted imprudently by not asking Dr. Laetus to lift my son from the sacred font; but I have indeed chosen him as a godfather! Dr. Laetus lifted the child along with another honorable matron who has done much good for me. Since Vogler arrived on the same day after the child was baptized, he also wanted to have this title, although he was not present at the baptism. Therefore, he is not a true godfather, but an adopted one. This is confirmed by the poem that Dr. Laetus sent me along with a Rhenish guilder: "What I promised you by the waters of baptism, let this golden one be witness to the matter."</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Therefore, do not think that anything inappropriate was admitted here!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>What you wrote to Laetus about the Helvetic matters, I still do not know. I do not doubt that the Lord has reserved some among them who have not bowed their knees to Baal. However, I see the most corrupt state of their republic. Many from the Five Places are in our city. Yesterday, a man from Uri celebrated his wedding here, to which he also invited me, along with two from Schwyz, people from Glarus, Bern, St. Gallen, and two from Zurich, one from Zug, and some from Toggenburg who serve in the city garrison, honorable young men. I strongly exhort them to true piety and to recognize how great their blindness is. May they finally repent, who now do not fear to offer us help against their own religion. They are benevolent (unless they are pretending) towards our religion, hoping soon to bring the rest and they pretend no other cause than that internal war completed with the blood of our fathers. They confess that this alone made them so obstinate. However, they are ready to promote our religion with all their might. May the Lord grant that I may still see Switzerland united around the true religion!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Thank you for sending the book by Dr. Theodor. There are many citizens who wish to read it. Whatever it costs, take it from the 2 crowns, if they have returned them. If they give nothing, I will pay.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I will translate the preface to Luke into German as you request.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I wrote about the Zoller matter in previous letters. He is alive and well. He has been in several skirmishes. The matter is not as many have preached to his discredit. A certain prostitute was the cause of the dissension, but how or in what way, I have not been able to ascertain, except that I hear he is very grateful to his lord and very much grieved for his case. I wrote eight days ago to the governor of Kyburg about this matter. I think the letters have been delivered by you, so do not desire my diligence here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>If I wrote less frequently last month, Vogler was the only reason, as he noted everything so diligently that it seemed superfluous to add anything.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Frölich may write more fully about what is happening now. However, so that I do not seem negligent, here is what I have: After our army was surrounded by the Emperor's cunning, but by the greater virtue of God, although exhausted by great labors and with the greatest hunger, it was again superior (as I depicted in my recent letters, one of which I wrote on the 24th, if I am not mistaken, of August, the other on the 26th, which I also hope have been delivered to you). Now the whole army is pressing the Emperor. They have made four divisions: the Elector has one, the Landgrave the second, Schertlin the third, and the one from Heideck the fourth. On the 26th of August at the hour of supper, several hundred Spanish and Italian horsemen advanced and were seen. About 300 horsemen from the Hessian camp attacked them and, with 60 saddles (as it is said) stripped, 15 captured, turned the rest to flight. Among the captives is a great captain dressed in fine linen over his armor, bearing a silver key on a golden sleeve. There is various talk about him. Some say he is the Pope's nephew, the Duke of Camerino; others say he is from the Roman patricians. They confessed that the Emperor does not want to engage in battle until the army from Lower Germany has joined him. Therefore, having fortified the camp with a rampart and ditches, he delays advancing to battle. Our forces press his camp. Only one nobleman from the Hessians was lost; 9 horses were wounded.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>There are daily skirmishes. On the 28th of August, Italians or Spaniards (for our men do not know the distinction) attacked our guards and killed about 20 of our men, including the standard-bearer of the captain from Heideck. They were repelled in the tumult and retreated to a certain village. Therefore, the next day Schertlin with his men surrounded that village, provoking them to battle. Since they did not want to advance, he set the village on fire in four places and forced them to advance like foxes with smoke. Therefore, bursting forth, not without the loss of some of our men, yet 200 and more of theirs were killed. In this skirmish, Schertlin's horse was pierced by a cannonball, but he himself, though thrown, escaped unharmed. We await daily what more will be done.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>However, so that our men do not seem to seek only foreign territories in this war, not Christ and the propagation of the Gospel, they are beginning to reform the churches in the Diocese of Augsburg. However, because there is a great shortage of ministers (for ours are no more than 8, some of whom will also be sent to reform the churches), therefore our lords are sending letters to you through this messenger, asking you to help us in this part. I therefore commend and commit this matter to you, so that you do not refuse to send some to them. I would like to have one or two learned men with me and I will easily accomplish it if you send someone learned to stay with me in the city; for thus our number will finally be superior, so that the form can finally be reformed. Therefore, give your effort: Urge, press! This is our duty to diligently provide for the churches; this is finally to be a bishop. Thus the purity of doctrine can be preserved. We will take care that they are provided for honorably and liberally. They will be able to return to their homeland at some time when others arise, as I also hope. Only, do not let the miserable (indeed happy, who are freed from the Antichrist) churches be abandoned now! I think you can spare these: Eggstein, H[ans] von Dietikon, a relative of the consul Habii. I would recommend promoting one of these to Kaufbeuren. Wilberg-born Kaufbeuren, but it does not suit. Furthermore, Jacob the Tailor from Wangen, limping in feet, but truly not in doctrine, and who, suffering great poverty, could be promoted here. Moreover, Gallus, the parish priest at Bubikon, who was in the monastery of Ochsenhausen; among the young ones, Bernard Lindauer, Ininger. I ask you to promote this one, unless you doubt him. I pity him, although I do not have much familiarity with him. My predecessor in Illnau, who is now in Richterswil, also has a son. They might all be needed. I would like to be present with them, so that nothing is done wrongly from the beginning, for they will not be entrusted with the reformation. Curio will also be called by Lord Herbrot, his patron. Cervinus could also serve as a common soldier. There are others. From whom I ask you to select some. It is not necessary that they be very learned, if only they are pious, teach solidly, and are of blameless life. I hope the matter will go well! I am working entirely to form schools and studies, so that they also have young men whom they instruct and ordain for ecclesiastical offices.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Cellarius is a good man, but not very studious. Musculus has all the troubles with the mass priests, before he brings it to the council.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Do your best. It will be good for many things.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>All this hastily; forgive me, I pray. For I am hurrying to Laetus to read what you have written to him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Vadian has already written to me several times in a friendly manner. Also Blaurer and others.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet Dr. Pellican, Theodor, Gwalther (from whom I expect the portrait of Zwingli) and your whole family. From Augsburg. Sixtus greets you, the author of this pasquinade, which Laetus sends. On the first of September 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, as much as he is, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, his lord and venerable father. Zurich.</p>
