      <p>S. What I had, I wrote recently. I can add nothing to this now, except that the queen is working hard for her Polish son, to bring him back to France, whom they say has already been declared king of France by her, and almost all the French applaud him and conceive some hopes about him (namely, that they now have another and much more cruel executioner instead of the former one) and they try to persuade everyone how much he has changed after seeing and hearing the princes of Germany, and that he has already testified so many times in his letters written to France, how much he is inclined to maintain peace; that he indeed was once of the persuasion that it was not possible for different religions to be maintained in the same kingdom, but that he has now learned this among the Poles, who, although they differ greatly in religion, nevertheless maintain the highest concord in preserving and defending their republic and liberty, and that he sees that unless the French do this too, it will be all over for them. You would hear the marvelous voices of the Sirens, so that I marvel at the stupidity and foolishness of this nation; for if those who are of the contrary religion did this, I would not wonder; but it is strange to hear similar things from those too, who have so painfully escaped the hands of these executioners. They say the queen has already asked the princes of Germany to make her return free and safe through their territories and not to allow soldiers to be led from Germany to France. However, I hope that while the French and Poles contend over this king, he too will depart, as he deserves, to his ancestors. They say our Swiss have been magnificently received in Belgium and have been given hope that more will be summoned and that another departure will take place.</p>
      <p>Condaeo, I don't know what injury was inflicted in Strasbourg and it was demanded by the people of Strasbourg that they guard him; he himself, having learned of the matter, fled from there. Merlin told me this. Otherwise, nothing occurs to me to write now, except that I pray the Lord to keep you for a very long time. I walk, but with great difficulty because of my feet swelling at night; nevertheless, I do and provide whatever I can and as much as I can, always ready for the Lord's will.</p>
      <p>Both consuls greet you; neither of the treasurers is in the city, nor is Diesbach, but Hagenberg, Telamon's widow, the Frischings, the Zehenders, and our Joshua Witenbach. Greet in my name the friends and brothers, especially those who are of your household.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 29, 1574.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
