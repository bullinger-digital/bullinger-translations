      <p>Greetings. At this hour I have received your letters, and since the messengers were at hand, I wanted to respond briefly to them: first, regarding Gervasius, I am deeply saddened by the death of his dearest wife; but since this is from the Lord, whatever it is, it should not be protested impatiently. However, as you think his calling has been made void, it is not so; indeed, the people of Lenzburg wrote here, undoubtedly instigated by that Summerius Vertumnus, asking that he not be taken away from them. But since Gervasius was already ordained, the honorable lords did not want to disappoint him in his hope; therefore, they ordered Summerius to vacate that place. Nothing therefore remains but for Mr. Gervasius to occupy the designated place.</p>
      <p>Mr. Musculus, having returned from Basel, was soon after Mr. Gervasius's departure seized by a fever and had only one, but a very severe, paroxysm, so that we were very concerned about him. But it was only a diary contracted from the fatigue of the journey; for he soon began to feel better, and the whole illness turned into erysipelas; he does not leave the house. He in turn also greets you with all yours, as does his wife and children.</p>
      <p>Regarding the third degree of blood relationship, it is held here as follows:</p>
      <p>Children of siblings are completely forbidden; but if children of siblings' children take each other, unless on both sides it is beyond the children of siblings or now on one part, if the relationships or they, the persons themselves, come before the court to ask the council whether it is possible or not, they are kindly dismissed to avoid scandal; but if it is the case that the sleeping together has preceded the council's inquiry, then it is left as a marriage without separation, and therefore the blood relationship is not further completely forbidden than to the children of siblings.</p>
      <p>I wanted to respond to your letters quickly, so that you would understand that I have received yours and that Mr. Gervasius's calling has been confirmed. Farewell with all yours, whom you will greet very much from me and mine. Bern, June 4, 1550.</p>
      <p>J. H. entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable lord and compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
