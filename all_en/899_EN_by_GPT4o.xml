      <p>Johannes Blasius to his dear Bullinger, greetings.</p>
      <p>Our Tscharner delivered your letters along with mine very well, most esteemed patron, and upon understanding them, I immediately sent them, at your suggestion, to be read by Lord Tscharner with the bishop and the Travers family, which turned out very well according to my intention. For from these, they could easily gather what my disposition towards the bishop was and deduce that I had written nothing of the sort against him, but rather against his competitors in the election. Upon returning, Tscharner brought me the good news: the bishop has been reconciled with me, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it remains for me to give you immense thanks for your prudence, with which you are accustomed to preserve the letters of friends; for I rightfully confess that I owe this reconciliation to you, since without these letters of mine, it would have been difficult to persuade him that I had not written against him. Now indeed, persuaded and reconciled, and having received from me a confession regarding his election, which I was pleased and it was fitting to give with a good conscience, he sent it to Rome in his defense.</p>
      <p>We therefore await what response we will receive from there; this will also be communicated to you. Meanwhile, farewell through the Lord, who may deign to preserve you for us, who are in danger, as a most faithful patron. Amen.</p>
      <p>In haste, Chur, May 6, 1550.</p>
      <p>Mr. Comander and the other good men send you their warmest regards.</p>
      <p>The same, yours sincerely, Blasius.</p>
      <p>To the man of prudence, true learning, and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most esteemed father of our homeland.</p>
      <p>To the Grossm√ºnster.</p>
