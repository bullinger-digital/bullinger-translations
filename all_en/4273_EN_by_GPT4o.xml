      <p>Because you have handled my sister's case with Burcher with such faith and diligence, she, along with me, is greatly grateful to you; I am sending, however, a fragment of a letter recently sent to me, earnestly urging you to also obtain letters from Burcher to the one who holds the king's privilege deposited with him, the use of which will be especially necessary for my sister. I truly think it is not unfair that my sister, in turn, offers Burcher without reluctance, if the success of new endeavors is fortunate. I am sending a note from a certain good friend, from which you will understand what truculent monster the supreme monarchs of the world are giving birth to, although they have long since given birth to such things, they will never bring forth what all the pious should wish and pray for. Regarding what you write about the Lutherans, there is nothing new; they do what they usually do, except that by being more and more foolish, they plainly show that they are driven more by emotions than by sound judgment. I have decided to send you this confession and declaration of the theologians and church ministers of the WÃ¼rttemberg region about the true presence of the body and blood of Christ in the supper, which has been entrusted to each pastor of the churches with the condition that no one, wherever they may have to move, should take it away from the church, but that it should be preserved with utmost diligence; I ask, however, that you return this with the next messenger.</p>
      <p>From Augsburg, it is written that those Saxons who are preachers there, preach the ubiquity of Christ (for thus they beautifully speak) according to human nature to the point of tedium and nausea and confidently condemn all who think otherwise, despite the protests of all the holy ancient church doctors and the new school sophists alike; so much so that their reckless audacity dares anything, not seeing that many contradictions about Christ cannot be reconciled without the communication of idioms.</p>
      <p>They are now called by many in Augsburg ubiquists or ubiquitaries, a new kind of theologians, from whom may the Lord Jesus soon vindicate and purify His church. From France, nothing certain has been brought for some time now.</p>
      <p>Would that we do not soon hear things that are not very pleasing! The case of my wife's inheritance stands thus, that the other heirs have offered a friendly transfer, which we also, by the advice of friends and other good men, did not wish to refuse; therefore, a day has been set, namely the upcoming Friday, when there will be a meeting at the Bishop's residence. If by chance what is attempted is not obtained, it will be possible to try everything by law. Therefore, you will pray with us that our Christ may turn everything for the good.</p>
      <p>In which, farewell well and eternally, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother in Christ, with your household and all the fellow ministers and professors of your school, whom you will greet on my behalf most reverently and dutifully, commending me to their pious prayers with utmost diligence. In Winterthur, on the first of May, 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his brother in Christ, uniquely esteemed and dearly beloved.</p>
