      <p>I do not complain that you do not write back to me, but I inform you that I have not received any of your letters for a long time and I take it well, whether you could not, or did not want to, or they were lost; for why should I not do so with my Bullinger? Now I write to inform you that I am well by the grace of God and still alive; for the most holy vicar of the devil sought me through his emissaries on the day after the calends of March, when I was in NÃ¼rtingen, and it was almost that he made me a martyr. I used to walk in the morning a little before lunch along the Neckar to a certain place, so that I even penetrated into the forest. There, therefore, there were three who awaited me that day; I did not penetrate that day and came home suspecting nothing of evil. The next day the duke came; he learned the whole matter and immediately sent me to Stuttgart as if to a safer place in the whole duchy. Thus it is. Is it not a shame for that Tiberian beast, accustomed to trample the necks of Caesars underfoot, to pretend to fear a certain mask(?). Oh shame. You, Heinrich Bullinger, who are dearest to him, warn him not to behave so. But if I have escaped, it is in the memory of Juan Morel, a Spaniard, minister of the French church in Frankfurt, a most excellent and holy man. He was taken away there with a companion by the poison of life, oh what a man they have taken away, how great in piety. Thus, I say, it is. I believe the beast suspected I would go to the diet, where he does not want to see me. But I am there and alive, indeed with writings and counsels.</p>
      <p>I hope for some great good, when I see that devil burning with such rage, he senses his own destruction. Now as for the business, great cunning is being used, one thing is proposed, another is ordered to be made public. You hear this: a conspiracy seems to have been made among the Catholics, as they call themselves; he who dwells in the heavens will laugh at them. Whatever I wrote before, the first theme was only about religion; but I know our people will bear the Pavia agreements.</p>
      <p>Now they are still in the preambles. Our duke has returned there and indeed with his wife; he will resist vigorously.</p>
      <p>Sleidan's history, as I hope, will be published at this fair. What did Antiochus not do to suppress it; but the lords of Strasbourg seem appeased. My Pole will also be published, to whom I think some reputation has been taken away. Now I attack the Morons, as you will see in the booklet I send, although I do much more against him every day with other manuscripts. Farewell, best brother.</p>
      <p>Give my greetings to Zwingli, Lavater, your Josias, Gwalter, and all the others. Help me with your prayers. I wish to come to you for the reason I wrote, but more for the sake of the duke, who fears for me, than for any other reason I fear; but these clouds will vanish. Stuttgart, March 21, 1555.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>[To] the most illustrious man [Mr.] Heinrich Bullinger, etc.</p>
