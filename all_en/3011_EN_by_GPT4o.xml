      <p>I have sent a letter to you, most excellent Bullinger, once since I came to Lausanne, but I doubt whether it has reached your hands or not; therefore, I have decided to repeat now what I had written before, namely that I am by no means forgetful of my duty towards you, whom I both know and profess to be bound to by many ties. I owe this to your kindness, and also to the benevolence of Haller shown to me for your sake. Therefore, my holy father, enroll me in your list. Oh, how much I owe to God Almighty, who provides for me in such a way that I can now freely use such patrons, while my England serves miserably in the meantime! From whose servitude I have received this from D. P. Martyr through letters; that Philip has already sought London and was received with great applause from the people.</p>
      <p>Thomas Becket is publicly proclaimed a saint. The names of all those who do not attend masses are being inquired. Some Franciscan friars have arrived and are residing in Winchester. These are the public evils he mentions.</p>
      <p>Regarding private matters, he adds that Judge Hales threw himself into a river and thus was miserably suffocated: this is the punishment for apostasy. But to return to England. Behold, England is forced to serve the Spaniards, the worst of all nations, with their fictitious saints, the most vile sons of the Antichrist, and the worst idolatry. But this is not the only servitude to be mourned, to which we are unwillingly subjected, but also that by which we willingly serve our own impenitence. This, this servitude oppresses us miserably, holds us bound within the stony walls of our hearts, and compels us to serve the most unclean swine in harsh servitude, indeed it almost makes us pigs and dogs; yet we have no mind to return to our Father: and although this is the only way of salvation for us, to appease the angry Father with tears in Christ, this one thing we do not care for, who in other matters wish to appear overly curious. Hence apostasy, hence despair, or desperate security in impiety.</p>
      <p>I complain about these things to you, most excellent man, so that you may pray to God for us all the more, as we are more negligent; and also so that, if you have the time, you may freely pray for me, that you would be willing to give some exhortation and instruction to the English (among whom your authority is great), by which they might be better instructed in conducting themselves in this time. If you write it in Latin, there will certainly be those who will translate it into English. The late M. Bucer wrote a congratulatory letter to the English when England had just received the gospel. Let Bullinger also write something now, by which the pious may be consoled, and the impious admonished. If I seem importunate in asking for these things, I will indeed gladly bear the mark of importunity with you, provided you benefit our church with this favor.</p>
      <p>I call it a favor, because I am fully convinced that many of ours will draw much solid repentance from it. And when the Lord finds this among our people, He will surely show Himself to be a merciful Father, and will also freely restore to us the gospel and our homeland. What kind of future benefit this will be, any pious person can easily judge. Therefore, most excellent Bullinger, if you have time amidst your other most useful church affairs, do what you see will benefit our afflicted church. May our eternal God, and the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, always guide you with His Holy Spirit into all truth.</p>
      <p>Yours most observantly, Thomas Sampson. Please greet, in my name, D. Gualter, to whom I also wish the care of our church. I know he certainly cares for it, and that greatly; and may he care for it and always care for it, and earnestly pray to God for it, and extend his hand to it even when it is languishing. Also greet D. Vike, my host, and our Englishmen. Please deliver this letter to my brother, entrusting it to one of your boys. May the Lord Jesus bless you and all yours. Hastily.</p>
      <p>In Lausanne; 13th September [1556].</p>
      <p>To the most learned man D. Heinrich Bullinger, these are given. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
