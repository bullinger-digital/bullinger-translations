      <p>I do not cease to pray daily, dearest brother, that He who has sounded the trumpet for this most holy work in both of us may grant us perseverance in our original purpose. The more I see the schemes of the dark ones being exposed, the more my spirit burns in prayer. Nor is there any lack of comfort, for in the midst of turmoil, I find consolation in a miraculous way. I experience daily that the mortification of the flesh is nourishment for the spirit. As a result, being a participant in the common afflictions, I cannot help but feel an excessive sympathy for the afflictions of my brothers.</p>
      <p>Therefore, having recently been made aware of your miseries by the report of friends, I certainly felt sympathy, yet in such a way that I more deeply perceived the rays of the future glory of Christ shining through, and upon reviewing them - it is the spirit that speaks - I saw heaps of eternal riches, and my mind immediately burst into praises, expending the energy of the most powerful Father, whose genius is beyond all human wisdom, revealing the sinews of extreme happiness in the midst of turmoil. I do not doubt that the Almighty, the nourisher of all things, has thus far assisted your, I say, brotherly efforts, nor that you have thus far acknowledged this benefit bestowed upon you from above with sound faith; yet I am not unaware of human, that is, null powers, with which we often tend towards the depths with "fleshy hearts," to use the word of Prudentius. Therefore, dearest brother, I do not hesitate to spur you on in your undertaking with this letter. Proceed, proceed, therefore, sharer in future happiness and participant in common afflictions, do not be deterred by the cunning of this world. The ulcer of Satan feels the cautery, it cries out, it thunders, it threatens the utmost. The son of delinquency, as Tertullian says, is about to be destroyed. It is certainly giving up the ghost. Meanwhile, in this way, the number of those resting is daily being filled. It is enough for divine mercy that we are convicted for the salvation of the soul, by which we are so supported that even in the midst of death we feel absolutely nothing beyond eternal life. Let it greatly console you that Gervasius, your companion in your troubles, which you suffer for the glory of Christ, is with you. Let it refresh your spirit that I am daily especially mindful of you before God in my prayers. Break through the ranks of the impious with a strong, that is, faithful spirit. The Lord stands ready, by whose most present help we shall depart victorious. O how happy we are if it should happen that we are endangered for the glory of Christ! Only let the Lord be present as He has promised.</p>
      <p>As for my own affairs, there is nothing with which I wish to burden your ears. Setting aside all else, this is the one thing I desire, that God may daily and more deeply insinuate Himself into our minds, so that as sharers in the afflictions of Christ, His life may be manifested in us. Thus transformed into the glory of His body, we may one day be revived into a life that never perishes.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my delight. Greet your wife, who has always deserved well of me, in my name. Pray for me, brother.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel, October 4, in the year one thousand five hundred and thirty-two.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, my dearest brother in the Lord, in Zurich.</p>
