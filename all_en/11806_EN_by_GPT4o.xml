    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Blarer's letter [No. 1757] with the terrible war news; we hope for the return of Christ; the people of Central Switzerland, to the displeasure of the people of Zurich, are waiting for the signal from King Francis [I of France] to set out. He has forwarded Blarer's news to [Johannes] Haab and Treasurer [Hans Rudolf] Lavater, as [Diethelm] Röist is staying for a cure in Baden; they are pained by the fate of our time, but we must bear it; Blarer should continue to share news. Requests feedback on the commentary on John, the rest of which he will still send; he is working on the 14th chapter, the tenth is in print. Is in a hurry. Greetings. Let us call upon God in these troubles!</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Today, my venerable Blarer, I received your letters written about the most calamitous wars of the kingdoms of the entire Christian world. Everywhere there is distress, everywhere labor and sorrow; but these are the last times. Would that the Lord Jesus, our salvation, hope, and consolation, would soon deliver us with His glorious coming into the world. The people of Central Switzerland, that is, the Moabites, Ammonites, and Edomites, are waiting for the unfortunate King Francis of the Egyptians to give the signal and sound the trumpet.</p>
      <p>Our people are deeply grieved.</p>
      <p>I give you the greatest thanks for your letters; I have presented them, which you sent, to Mr. Haab, the consul, and to Lavater, the treasurer, etc.; for Mr. Röist is taking the waters in Baden, which I pray may be fortunate and prosperous for him and his family. They grieve over the fate of our age; but with a strong and unbroken spirit through Christ, these things must be borne. Perhaps these are the beginnings of sorrows. I beg you, do not fail us, but continue to write to us with that faith and diligence, which you have been accustomed to do until now, about what you receive from trustworthy men.</p>
      <p>You have what I wrote on John. I beg you, do not conceal anything in these. Advise, please, and if anything seems to need changing, indicate it. I will send the rest when they are completed. I am now turning to the 14th chapter; they are printing the 10th. I can scarcely write as much as the insatiable press devours.</p>
      <p>Forgive, please, the somewhat careless writing. I had begun to dine; the courier indicated he was about to leave; night was approaching. I wrote these few things to a most beloved and always esteemed friend and brother.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest brother, together with your most chaste wife and faithful family. July 7, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Let us lift up our heads in these troubles and cry out to our most merciful God.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, his dearest.</p>
