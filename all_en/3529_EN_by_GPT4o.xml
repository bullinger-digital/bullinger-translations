      <p>Fr. Hotomanus sends greetings.</p>
      <p>It is exactly as you write, most illustrious man, today there is great treachery among those to whom letters are entrusted. I experienced this four months ago with letters of great importance, which I was writing to Mr. Calvin, which he himself complains were intercepted, and I here experienced it not without pain. However, I am very glad that the Institutes were finally found, and I pray that you will not let the negligence of others be a detriment to me.</p>
      <p>You are probably not unaware that Beza, Budaeus, and Bertinus have set out for Frankfurt. The reason for their departure is the impiety of certain individuals who, corrupted by cardinal money, had prevented the sending of the princes' envoys. Then there are the new wars of the pope, concerning the inquisitorial cardinal triumvirate, to which two most cruel and Phalaric or Pharaonic edicts concerning the jurisdiction of those triumvirs are subjected. Our senate has a most commendable task: it also interposes its efforts in convening a council of Swiss and German theologians. Those who will only care for their own city, family, and church will refuse.</p>
      <p>All will testify that they do not wish to desist from their opinion. But those who will look to the churches scattered throughout Europe and still subject to tyranny, who will desire the pacification of the churches, the glory of Christ, and the tranquility of consciences, in my judgment, will not miss any opportunity to seek peace.</p>
      <p>They will commit the outcome to the hands of almighty God, and they will not philosophize about certain persons and individual matters, but will obey the most certain calling of God. The sight, presence, conversation, communication of speech, etc., move greatly.</p>
      <p>But you perceive these things better due to your singular prudence and piety. Therefore, I will only add this, card.</p>
      <p>Lotharingen wrote to the Palatine that the Parisian captives are unworthy for whom he, along with the other princes, should intercede, since they are all Calvinists, Zwinglians, sacramentarians. Thus, in the two royal edicts, they are never called Lutherans, as before, but always sacramentarians. You know what this implies.</p>
      <p>Beza is now again asking the princes.</p>
      <p>The king needs their help and soldiers.</p>
      <p>If they refuse help to the wretched because of that disastrous dispute about the sacrament, what will happen? But if a conversation is established, and some means of peace is found, (which is not at all in men, but entirely placed in God alone) then you see how much support will be prepared in them, how much comfort for all consciences. Therefore, may God, the best and greatest, the author of peace and concord, who promised to deny nothing to those who knock and seek Him, stir our minds to the consideration of His power.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, March 7, 1558.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich, my most esteemed lord and parent.</p>
