      <p>Greetings and Peace. I hope, most excellent lord and godfather, that the letters which I sent to you on the journey have been delivered, from which you have understood our course and progress up to Strasbourg. From there we departed on the second day of April, all in good health and well-being by the munificence and grace of God. The first day of navigation from Strasbourg was fortunate, and we enjoyed favorable wind and river. On the second day, God was no less present with us. We spent the night of this day in a village near Speyer, where on the same day at lunch there were three hundred sixty-four Spaniards, all horsemen, who ascended towards the Duchy of Württemberg, so driven by hunger that they left neither meat nor fish for the guests on our behalf: we lived meagerly, satisfied with their leftovers. Among them, there is no choice of food nor regard for days, for which so much Christian blood is shed by the madness of the papists. The third day of navigation was joyful in all respects, the fourth more perilous.</p>
      <p>We encountered adverse wind, high waves, inexperienced and careless sailors; so that we were twice exposed to great dangers, and unless we had reached land, which was done with great difficulty, our lives would have been at risk. This happened half a mile from Mainz: we all came on foot into the city safe and sound.</p>
      <p>The other ship, which accompanied us, suffered more severely: many goods were contaminated by water; the captain, agitated by the force of the storm, when he wanted to lower the anchor, entangled his leg with the rope that held the anchor's weight, so that he now feels gravely injured.</p>
      <p>In Mainz, we turned to the Golden Swan, where we found six merchants who came from the city of Liège. They told us that the Emperor, with his son Philip, is now in Brussels in great triumph and glory. They report that the evil Landgrave is detained captive near Ghent. I inquired whether the Emperor was preparing to ascend again into Upper Germany. They said that no such rumor was spread among them. I asked about the cities of the Locusts. They said the Emperor would lead all his forces there this summer. May victory remain with those who most desire the safety of the Church of Christ. Let us pray to God, and He will deliver His own from temptations. I hope this will happen, provided we are united in holy concord (which alone will break the Emperor's strength). The affairs of Saxony are doubtful and varied and, as it is said here, placed in the greatest danger due to internal discord; if they are not set aside, they will perish by mutual wounds.</p>
      <p>From England, I have nothing to write, except that it is miserably and with great danger exposed to bloody war, safe from no side. The French and Scots are open enemies. A third, more powerful than both, lies hidden: time will reveal him, I fear. I have often earnestly begged you to interpose yourselves between the French and the English; and now again and again, I humbly implore you for the sake of Christ, the reconciler of peace. Remember your reward, which He who cannot lie has promised: "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God." Let not the majesty of the royal name or the smoke of another's title deter you. Moreover, the situation and condition of the King and the Kingdom of England are now different than before: he is your brother, they worship the same God and, I hope, in the same way as you. If they continue thus and admit no fair conditions, one or the other of them must soon succumb.</p>
      <p>A new coin is now being minted in England, and the gold is more excellent than under the deceased king; but what is increased in one is diminished in another: about a quarter of the weight is diminished in the crowns. Regarding the cloth, which I promised you, I will not forget, but will send it as soon as possible.</p>
      <p>While I was writing this, your letters were delivered to me, most esteemed lord and godfather, which you sent on March 26. I receive nothing more gladly than those which testify to your well-being, which the Lord Almighty, the creator of heaven and earth, may long preserve safe and sound. I wish you had written a word about the pious matron, our co-godmother, the wife of Mr. Bibliander. I hope in the Lord Jesus that she has given birth happily: if not, I would be greatly grieved. I would now write to my godfather Mr. Bibliander, if any subject provided me with an occasion to write. When I come down, I will write more to you. In the meantime, farewell, and may the most indulgent Heavenly Father grant that you may always fare well in the blood of His Son, our Savior Jesus Christ; and remember, most excellent godfather, to continue vigorously, as you do, in your holy and perilous arena. If even the slightest suspicion of your constancy troubled my thoughts, I would spur the running horse.</p>
      <p>But I know you inside and out, and I have no doubt that you will surpass my expectations in many ways. I promise myself this about you from the heart, that as a good shepherd you will lay down your life for your sheep.</p>
      <p>I have persuaded myself the same about our learned and vigilant brother Mr. Gualter. Let others say, diminish, excuse as they will, who, when the wolf came, allowed the sheep to be torn by thieves and robbers; unless they repent, on that day, when the true shepherd comes to separate the sheep from the goats, they will most miserably pay the penalty of the hirelings. For your piety towards us and singular benevolence, when my servant comes to you, urge him to diligently write down the memorials of your sermons, not only on the Epistle to the Romans, but on Isaiah and so on the other prophets, so that I may learn and help others with the gifts of God bestowed upon you. In my name, you will also beseech my lords and brothers Mr. Gualter and the most learned Theodor, men to be honored by me forever. I left enough money in Zurich; I will liberally reward their work, provided they do not spurn my prayers.</p>
      <p>I have asked that they comply with my request in this matter and apply all diligence, so that the sermons and lectures may be written down at my expense. You only need to remind them, pious godfather. I ask no more: enough other burdens rest on your shoulders. I will not write about the civility of the hosts up to this city from Strasbourg: they are barbarous Scythians and harsh and inhumane Getae. Farewell again. My wife, daughter, Stomphius, Joanna, and Martin send their greetings to you, as do I, with your dear spouse and the whole family; also Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Gualter, Mr. Pellican, with their families, excellent men and most deserving of us. Furthermore, we commend to Almighty God your holy church and republic and the most prudent consul Lavater, that He may defend you from the enemies of His name.</p>
      <p>In Mainz, hastily, April 8, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours in mind and body.</p>
      <p>Sledanus of Strasbourg has written a book of histories to our king. Doctor Andernach, also a physician of Strasbourg, has translated some work on medicine from Greek into Latin and dedicated it to the Bishop of Canterbury. You see how they all strive vigorously for profit; without a doubt, if no danger threatened them, both our king and kingdom would lack their favor and support. I hear that the wife of Bernardino now walks in England in dress and attire as a noble Frenchwoman; but I will know more about this shortly and you will know. I ask that you kindly greet Lord Memmingen, the preacher, and my host and hostess Zink.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man and lord, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the most pious Church of Zurich.</p>
