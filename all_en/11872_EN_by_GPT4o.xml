    <p xml:id="regest1">Praises Erb's efforts for the young [Hans Wilpert] Zoller, who is now inclined towards a career in trade; such a career is preferable to courtly life. He eagerly wishes to see Erb in Zurich someday. Thanks for the copy of the letter from Beatus Rhenanus, who is held in the highest esteem by Bullinger and from whom he hopes for further historical research. A few days ago, the Swiss mercenaries returned from the war in the Netherlands; Bullinger would be grateful for reliable information about the Diet of Speyer. In Zurich, there is harmony among the pastors; regards.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I commend your diligence, which you have faithfully demonstrated in the matter of Zoller, the young man I entrusted to you. May the Lord reward you. That it did not succeed was indeed the will of the Lord. In the meantime, the young man has turned his mind to trade. May it be fortunate and beneficial for him! I indeed approve of this more than a courtly life.</p>
      <p>However, I promise, for your faithfulness, my entire self, and that with equal faith and no less diligence, I will also take care of what I have entrusted to me concerning your affairs.</p>
      <p>Would that I could see Erb in Zurich someday! Last autumn, many of our people were held by the great hope that we would then enjoy the most desired brother.</p>
      <p>Since that did not happen then, come when it is convenient for you, the sooner, the more welcome.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, you have done a most pleasing thing by sending me a copy of the letter from Mr. Beatus Rhenanus, a man most learned in every way and whom I have esteemed for many years. For there is no one living today among the learned whom, though I have never seen, I love and revere so respectfully. May the Lord keep him safe for us for a long time and through him reveal to us the remaining antiquities of Germany, our most beloved homeland.</p>
      <p>We have no news, except that the Swiss soldiers, our confederates, returned from the Belgian war a few days ago. You would do a not ungrateful thing if you shared what has been reliably reported to you about the Diet of Speyer.</p>
      <p>We are all well here, the ministers, and we embrace each other with the greatest love. The matter of religion is progressing, and there is, thanks to God, the utmost concord among us.</p>
      <p>That it may be constant and perpetual for us, please pray to the Lord for us. May all the brothers be safe in the Lord. Mr. Megander, Fabritius, Pelicanus, Bibliander, Gwalther, and all the others greet you. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 8, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Matthias Erb, pastor of Reichenwil, dearest brother.</p>
