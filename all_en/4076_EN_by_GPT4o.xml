      <p>Greetings. Samuel Wittenbach, who accompanied you, beloved brother, to Winterthur, told me that due to declining strength, you have bid farewell to the ecclesiastical ministry and have decided to give yourself to rest, and for that reason, you have returned to Winterthur, etc. I would have wished for you to have solid and complete strength so that you could have died in the holy ministry. But since you know better than others what you can do, I pray to the Lord that what you have decided is for your well-being, etc. As per my old custom, I make you a participant in my labors.</p>
      <p>Some time ago, I sent my Catechism; I now submit Sermons on Jeremiah 44; I did not want you to lack any book written by me, consider it kindly. Live well, farewell, and love me.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 13th of September, in the year 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Winterthur.</p>
