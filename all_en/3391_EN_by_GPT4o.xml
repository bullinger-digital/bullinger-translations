      <p>Greetings. I received your long-awaited letter, venerable elder, esteemed lord, and dearest brother, and I give immortal thanks to our Lord God, who still preserves you among the living, despite your advanced age and rather troublesome illness. Continue to give thanks to our Lord God and pray that He may grant you health in your longevity and relieve all your troubles. I am truly more sorrowful than you can believe that you are not getting along well with your honorable wife. I am even more sorrowful that she does not consider your age and frailty and, due to her own weakness or disposition, provides occasions for complaints and indignation. But what can you do? I pray, my lord, she is flesh of your flesh and bone of your bones; she is honorable, holy, and virtuous, and this is paramount in marriage. If she, therefore, struggles with her own human emotions, I pray you forgive her and consider that your Lord God, who loves you, exercises you in this way and that you should serve Him with patience. Perhaps she thinks you are too generous with the schools and studies and that you give away what she needs and what your domestic affairs require more. If you can appease her in this matter and make her more compliant to you, I pray you grant her this much. You have given enough and liberally enough to studies and schools, doing what even princely men would scarcely do. Therefore, reserve what remains and what comes from annual revenues or pensions for yourselves, so that peace, the most beneficial of all things, may prevail between you. And here I pray you, my lord and brother, to heed my advice, which I believe is not unwholesome, and comply with her to this extent.</p>
      <p>As for the fifty gold coins of yours, which you instructed Froschauer to count out to me (a gift and testimony of your gratitude towards me, who have served you in many ways and bestowed benefits upon you, receiving nothing in return from you, yet I am in need, as I make great expenses in educating my sons for studies), I give immortal thanks and have long understood your kind disposition towards me. And although I am deprived of many things and make greater expenses than I can sustain, I have learned through God's grace to be content with what I have, and I hope that I will have just enough left over so that no one can complain that they have lost anything because of me. I have often been offered support, and indeed ample support; yet I have never accepted anything from anyone, always content with my ecclesiastical stipend. Therefore, I also told our Froschauer to keep the money... yes, the fifty gold coins, until I tell him to whom he should give them; for I will not accept them. However, I pray your kindness, best and dearest brother, not to take this badly or be angry with me. I know how I offended you when you sent me a cup, and I returned the gift to you, for which you wrote back that you never thought you were dealing with someone who could not bear to be outdone by a friend. Listen, I beg you, my lord, to why I have acted this way so far and why I continue in my manner. I know that with the prudence and humanity you possess, you will not disapprove of my counsel and action. This city, in which I am now a citizen, was, forty years ago, most corrupt and divided into many factions.</p>
      <p>The root of such great evil was greed and the abundance of gifts or bribes offered by princes. For this reason, one would follow the pope, another the emperor, a third the French king, and a fourth some other prince from whom he received gifts. From this arose murders, wars, hatreds, dissensions, and countless evils.</p>
      <p>The matter finally led to sedition, which was dissipated and quelled by divine grace in this way: they agreed henceforth that no one should follow the party of any prince or accept any gift from any prince or city or in any other way, etc., but each should attend to his own affairs, conduct his own business, and care for the peace and safety of the country. A capital sentence was established for transgressors, and the whole matter was put into writing, and tablets were made, which are publicly read in the temple every six months and confirmed by an oath. In these, however, it is also recited verbatim: "However, it is excluded and reserved here that a native and relative or any other good lord and friend may make a gift and honor another for the sake of good friendship, companionship, neighborhood, and similar matters from his own goods, as has been customary from ancient times, without danger." Therefore, if I were to accept your fifty gold coins, I would know with a clear conscience and a tranquil mind that I am indeed not violating that law. But since I am not only a citizen but also a minister of the word and the church, who daily works for the preservation, integrity, or safety of that law, and there are more than is beneficial who wish the law to be violated or relaxed, and those same people would seize any opportunity and wish for some occasion to be offered by the ministers, which they could use to achieve their depraved desires, and since the Apostle Paul also says: All things are lawful for me, but not all things are beneficial and edifying; I do not wish to use this freedom, which I could use, at present. Just as that same apostle, when he could have received a stipend from certain churches, did not accept it, lest it should turn to the detriment of the gospel and his sacred ministry. Indeed, given the malice of some of our people, someone might accept a gift, which could not be compared with yours or mine, nor would they have the same reason on both sides, yet they would continually press: If ministers, who have ecclesiastical stipends, accept, why should I, who have nothing but what my hands earn, not also accept? etc. I greatly fear that from such an altercation some harm might come to the excellent and necessary law, and then also that some stain might be cast upon my ministry and the simpler ones might begin to suspect and hate me, who am otherwise sufficiently hated by the malevolent for the proclamation of the truth. Your prudence now understands that I am moved by the greatest reasons not to accept your offered gift, and I hope you will not take this badly. I consider it as if I had accepted it and all those things had come into my use.</p>
      <p>Finally, you would do me a most pleasing favor if you would give me instructions to distribute it according to the needs of the school and studies and the church, as I deem necessary. For since I will not convert it to my private use, it will be permissible to dispense it at your command, just as I disposed of previous monies for the use of the church at your command. I would also ensure that some memory of you remains in the public hypocaust of professors and ministers. But if you prefer the entire sum to return to you, I will diligently ensure that you receive it all at the next fair and indeed safely. Now I send to your piety a small gift, which you may retain as a perpetual memory of me, my sermons on Jeremiah, dedicated to you, as you will see. I pray you kindly accept this from your most loving friend.</p>
      <p>If I live and the Lord grants me the means, I will continue to explain the remaining orations of Jeremiah and will publish them, God willing, under your name, whether you live or have departed to the homeland. Live and farewell with your most honorable wife, whom my wife sends her best regards.</p>
      <p>Zurich, November 3, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
