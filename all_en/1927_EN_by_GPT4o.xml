      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg etc. and of Mömpelgard.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you, dear friend. We thank you very kindly for your two sermons, which you sent us along with your letter. Although we have not yet been able to read them due to physical weakness, we would have liked you to send us a couple more.</p>
      <p>That Doctor Charles du Moulin has earnestly solicited us for support and maintenance, and that he has also offered to accept conditions from our lord cousin Duke Christoph etc., we could have tolerated, but we would have preferred not to be asked on his behalf. These are sophistical and not theological matters, which du Moulin would do well to write and explain. We did not want to leave your letter unanswered. To both mayors with you, please convey our gracious greetings. Dated Riquewihr, the 16th of July, in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] of Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
