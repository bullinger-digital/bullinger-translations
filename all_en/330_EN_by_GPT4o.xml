      <p>Greetings. Through Dr. Paul Rassdorfer, I have sent everything back to you, and he himself promised that he would travel there directly with his wife and children. Perhaps he went straight to Bern; if that is the case, I regret that he forgot both my and your letters, which should have been delivered sooner, and thus did not fulfill his duty.</p>
      <p>Regarding your letter concerning the seven places, I thank you most sincerely. It gives me cause to reflect on these matters somewhat for the sake of our own people; for the practices of the shorn (monks) are persistent and astonishing. It has succeeded with the emperor that they will remain with force and compulsion in what is important to them, even if it is openly against Christianity, as long as God tolerates it; hoping that it will also succeed with the Confederates. The emperor pursues his pleasure and game; so the pope strives to keep his people in temporal and spiritual possession and religion, regardless of whether it is with God or against God. And it is quite believable that the emperor's people at this time cannot hope to break a praiseworthy confederation, as the great and troublesome tension of religion continues among the related places. Hence, the opposing party of the envious (which is large over a praiseworthy confederation) is confident that if it comes to action, due to such discord, people will not simply unite and unanimous support will not be found, but rather it will go lukewarm, and they could easily be conquered. And if that were to happen (may God faithfully prevent it), then those places that are of the emperor's faith would be much less spared in their temporal administrations for many reasons than the cities.</p>
      <p>And if our Confederates consider this with their good understanding from the five places, they will certainly have to decide that our long-standing unity should not be disrupted and endangered in such swift and dangerous courses because of the contentious religion, and therefore one part should not wish the other any less well, while both parts remain free in the intention of their consciences and no one is forced by the other to what would be burdensome and unbearable to their conscience, especially since such tension is not only in one confederation but now in the whole of Christendom, and since we are of no other mind than that, for the sake of maintaining common governance and well-being of a confederation, we should not be led astray in religion, but rather be willing and ready to trust them with life and property in all cases. And if anyone undertakes to impose their religion on us by force (as has unfortunately happened in many places so far), we are willing to assist them against force in matters of religion and to prevent such, as far as we can assure ourselves of the same in matters concerning us and our religion, as we do not wish to doubt this; for they should consider and measure well: if we were to be attacked by someone for the sake of religion, it would certainly not be only about religion, but much more about the secular governance for the sake of the temporal power, as one has learned evidently with the city of Constance. And for the sake of faith, one will have to unite at the right time with the grace of God, so that God's will and pleasure may be lived, as they are as willing to give way to the truth as we are; as we would also assure them of this.</p>
      <p>Since they now mean well from the heart, that unity should be planted in a confederation, they are on the right track; however, this unity must be intended to prevent violence against one another; then, without a doubt, no one will have to oppose what is proper and in accordance with letters and seals. But if they knowingly conceal what the emperor's plans are against the cities and do not honestly reveal this to their Confederates from the four cities, but rather allow that the emperor succeeds against the cities for the sake of religion, etc., then the matter will have no good foundation and will certainly serve over time to a separation, which could lead to the ultimate suppression of a praiseworthy confederation, as mentioned above. No one can see into the heart; but I would hope that the aforementioned seven places could still examine the matter so much that it would be as much about them as about us, if one were to allow oneself to be moved to discord for any reason, and they should also consider that we are not attacked for remaining so steadfast in our religion without fundamental and important reasons, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, regarding the first article, my answer would be that I could not desire anything higher and greater for the sake of unity of religion than that the contentious articles might be brought to the recognition of a free general Christian council and diligent consideration of the same. But whether one can hope for such a thing in the face of the many, open, and advantageous practices of the opposite side and whether the clergy (as they are disposed and constituted today) intend to submit freely and from the heart to such a council for the sake of truth and the salvation of souls, we leave to their consideration; likewise, whether the pope (who has also openly let the Confederates know that he intends to root out the doctrine of his opponents, which he calls Lutheran, to the ground and uproot it, etc.) will consent to any council in which the open and unbearable abuses of the Roman church should be abolished and reformed, since he continues to testify and prove with public, practiced deeds, not only with words, that he intends nothing else than to stand and remain with his currently held religion without any deviation. And although the words in the middle are quite good and one speaks of a general, free, Christian council and presents the same to the whole world, the matter is nevertheless played out in such a way that a council is convened in such a manner that nothing is dealt with against His Holiness, but everything is directed towards the suppression of his opponents, regardless of what the pure doctrine of the scripture and the ancient Christian interpreters of the same, along with the praiseworthy customs of the oldest churches of Christ, have before them, etc.; as one has learned very well at the recently held council in Trent.</p>
      <p>However, in all things, I would be of the opinion: wherever or however it may happen that through the insistence of the imperial majesty or other estates of Christendom a general, free, and Christian council is undertaken and held, then our learned men of the confederation should be freely allowed to bring everything to light that could and might serve and promote the clarification and endurance of the truth. And if then the mentioned council could prove to us, with unforced and unadorned, thorough and composed messages of the scripture and praiseworthy customs of the oldest churches of Christ, something different than we have had before, then we would (as the Bohemians did at the council in Basel) let ourselves be found with a proper and Christian answer. However, we fear that at this time, even for this one reason, no free and Christian council would easily be found, as those who are accused and charged with the greatest abuses and errors will immediately have and retain the power and precedence of recognition and decision in all councils, namely the pope's clergy and the same monastic orders, both of which are in the greatest and most necessary need of serious and Christian reformation, and yet it is not possible to achieve this in any way, as long as they are allowed to be judges and remain so, who are, however, the greatest part of all church concerns. And so that no one may accuse us of being self-righteous or obstinate, it seemed to me very fruitful that one should not exclude the approval of a general, free, and Christian council in all things, but also, to please our Confederates, enter into the same with the attached explanation, in the manner and form as mentioned above.</p>
      <p>Perhaps the seven places would also become more willing to help us against violence in matters of faith. The second article: that all those who have claims against us should not be denied proper justice, etc., that is well worth considering, so that one does not let oneself be led into a fog with a general, unconditional consent. I have today examined and read the agreement article by article and found one article, namely the eleventh: if there should be discord and disagreement, how one should take and give justice and before whom. Now I do not doubt at all that the mentioned article concerns only temporal and secular matters (since such an agreement was undertaken and concluded with secular and not with spiritual authority). However, nothing is too much for the elephant and the calumnies, and a bishop in Constance, likewise from Basel, as well as the provincial of the mendicant orders and other shorn fellows might think, since they are under the protection and shield of the princes of the house of Austria, as it will now be with Constance, that they might claim their goods and, because of the same, from which they are dispossessed, etc., likewise the bishops might make claims for their goods and temporal power and hope, according to such an article, that they should be granted justice; and we, however, do not approve of this, and they then press the Confederates and demand an explanation: then it would be well to consider that everything would stand in the hands of the seven places and one would thus be referred to the greater hand, which would immediately serve to suppress our religion and serve as a means to a restitution of this godless nonsense, and one bishop would be the judge and adjudicator in the matters of another, etc.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I would like to let this article, presented by the seven places, be immediately opened and clarified concerning temporal and secular matters, with clear insistence on what concerns religious matters, that we should be allowed to remain with the peace of the land and other established letters and seals and not be given place or opportunity to negotiate against them. For if such claims were to be left to the pan, then the article, serving the approval of a general Christian council, would not be fruitful in any way, but would be immediately vexed and twisted by those who are great enemies of our religion, and our cause would indeed be given away in all things; which would be very shameful and very indecent for such praiseworthy places (I will remain silent about the allied ones).</p>
      <p>In my opinion, however, it will be of great necessity that the mentioned four cities Zurich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen do not decide one after the other (since the matter is common) and if one could come to a single and unanimous answer, that would be the best; for our unity would be worth so much more in the eyes of the seven places, as well as the emperor, so much less would we be willing to endure such claims.</p>
      <p>The rumor is with us that the bishop of Constance is not entirely satisfied with the matter, that his seat and cathedral should be in a lordly city and not in a free city, in which he has nevertheless had great and almost all powers from ancient times. But I think these fellows will come to an agreement. May God protect a praiseworthy confederation.</p>
      <p>I am sending you herewith a copy of the oath that the city of Constance made to Mr. Nicholas von Bollwiler in the name of Ferdinand and his sons; in which you will see that little consideration was given to the peace of the agreement, but rather they have committed to serve and raise against all the world.</p>
      <p>I ask you to inform my lords, the mayors, of the matter of the allied cities and fellow believers in such a way that we are not excluded anywhere, although I do not doubt that everyone will be found willing to do so, especially my gracious lords of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Greet in my name our Musculus. I will soon write to him and take care with all my care and effort that some honorable and, as far as possible, liberal condition is provided for him. Farewell with the most learned college and with your wife, children, and all yours. St. Gallen, the third day before the calends of November, in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>I have constantly had the fantasy in me: since the unfaithful and tyrannical practices have so greatly disrupted and confused religious matters in the German nation, that God might well grant a confederation the grace, for the sake of the steadfast doctrine, that in these religious tensions great things might be achieved and great progress might be made for the preservation of the truth in many lands through the learned, well-understood people, which a confederation, thank God, has in many places, if only the five places would agree to the one thing, that our learned men at the time, as necessity would demand, might freely and publicly bring their intentions to light and not be complained about or attacked for it, nor should they be, as if they had acted against the peace of the land; for indeed all rights and also natural equity demand that both parties should be allowed to freely and completely reveal their concerns, so that the recognition may be much more in accordance with equity; for to allow everything to one party and to deny everything to the other is not only unjust but also unchristian and tyrannical.</p>
      <p>[To the most learned man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most illustrious city of Zurich, most esteemed friend].</p>
