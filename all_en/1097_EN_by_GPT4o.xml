      <p>From Augsburg: I am informed from Venice that the Turk is certainly in great preparation; for he is greatly angered by what has happened in Africa.</p>
      <p>There is much talk here about new horse requisitions; for Queen Maria is coming back here; likewise, the queen from France and the duchess from Lorraine are also coming here; we do not know what kind of storm these women are brewing here, as it is suspected to be about a marriage. The king's son has also come out of Spain. There might be a marriage between the prince and the one from Lorraine; she is very much Austrian; thus Lorraine will also come here, so that our empire will extend ever more from one to another up to hell, where the devil will be the next neighbor.</p>
      <p>Denmark and another duke have sent Magdeburg 4000 horsemen and 8000 foot soldiers; Duke Maurice is marching through the land, to the bishop of Bremen, intending to camp in Duke Maurice's land with great burden to the countryside. But the imperial majesty is very angry with Magdeburg, wants to attack them with full force, has imposed a heavy tax on the empire for three years, has great plans, etc.</p>
      <p>With Württemberg, it will be a strange situation. There are 500 horsemen stationed in Reutlingen and several hundred in Esslingen; some towns around there have paid money to avoid being burdened in this way.</p>
      <p>Some want the verdict to soon proceed in the justification between the king and Württemberg, and then the land will be taken over entirely and the young duke will be dismissed with little.</p>
      <p>There is such poverty everywhere in the land and throughout the Allgäu that it is unbelievable. God must make a great change, whichever way it may go; for this state of affairs cannot last much longer.</p>
      <p>The maiden in Esslingen along with her companions is still imprisoned, and more people who were complicit are still being sought. What will be done with them will soon become clear.</p>
      <p>There is nothing special, except that you have heard well from the butler what he has heard in Lindau from your envoy Pappo, who has returned home. May the dear God arrange everything with great grace, so that his believers may once be delivered from the severe tribulation.</p>
      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his best and greatest friend. Zurich.</p>
