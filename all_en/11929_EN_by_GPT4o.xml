    <p xml:id="regest1">The state of affairs prompts him to write again. [Konstanz] has not sent any envoys to the Imperial Diet [in Speyer], despite the urging of the Landgrave [Philip of Hesse] and the [Imperial] cities, but has only written to the cities, as can be read in the enclosed, confidential copy. In Friesland, the prophet David Joris appears, who has more than 14,000 followers, occupies many places, and kills opponents - so reports Doctor [Johann Winter von] Andernach, whose poem Blarer returns. Hans Welser writes from Augsburg that the English King [Henry VIII] supports the Emperor [Charles V] against [Francis I] with 40,000 men; he encloses Welser's letter so that Bullinger can see his opinion regarding the dedication of his Luke [Commentary] - even if Welser himself does not understand Latin, it will be an honor for his studying children. It is reported from Vienna that a lot of money has arrived in Buda and Gran for the payment of the Turkish army; since the Danube is navigable again, the next invasion is expected. He still cannot write openly about what he must keep silent, but it is a serious matter; he hears worrying things from the Imperial Diet, especially against the Confederates; the assistance of the [Imperial] estates [to Charles V against Francis I] is done out of self-interest. Even the Confederates, including the evangelicals, have God's punishment to fear. Therefore, [Zurich] should eliminate sins and injustice and also admonish the other Confederates to do so. If [Zurich] is obliged to support [Francis I] due to alliances, the city must support him, but perhaps only in the event of an attack on the territories in his possession at the time of the treaty signing or only under the condition of prior peace negotiations. If he is willing, the Confederates should report this to the Imperial estates. If the estates agree, at least there is temporary peace; if not, then no blame can be placed on the Confederates; if [Francis I] refuses negotiations without reason, [Zurich] would have a reason to refuse support. If the other Confederates do not agree, the city could distance itself from providing assistance. If the city is not obliged to provide assistance at all, it should advise the Confederates to write a joint letter to [Francis I] or the estates. Additionally, [Francis I] should write to Strasbourg to dissuade the city from providing assistance; furthermore, the Zurichers should write to [Konstanz] with the Bernese or all the Confederates, as this city has not yet received the Imperial Diet's decision and therefore has not yet approved assistance; this letter would give Konstanz a good reason to withdraw from providing assistance. Bullinger can imagine how detrimental it would be for the Confederation if Konstanz participated in the war, and also what a victory of the Emperor would mean for the city. It would be helpful if a more favorable letter regarding the Hütlin matter were sent to [Konstanz]; the previous behavior has caused much resentment. [Konstanz] also has trouble with the Kreuzlingen Monastery, as the dean [Georg Tschudi] wants to seize Konstanz's goods; the city has kindly offered a settlement negotiation; the dean has agreed, but the negotiations have been postponed for the time being; he writes everything in haste and with good intentions, as he likes to see good neighborliness. [The Konstanz council] has, like [Zurich], appointed people to discuss these dangers; may God show them the right way! He will report news from the Imperial Diet immediately and temporarily pay the messengers, whom he will choose carefully. Bullinger should only show this letter to [Diethelm] Röist, not read it in the council, and keep Blarer's name secret to avoid any disadvantages for him; it also saddens him that Bullinger read his long letter [No. 1879] in the council, possibly mentioning his name, as the greetings conveyed by Bullinger from [Hans Rudolf] Lavater and [Johannes] Haab suggest. Bullinger should also think about [Konrad Zwick's art of war], as [it] was reported that the King [Ferdinand I] and the Landgrave want to write to the secret councils. He has concealed that he writes to Bullinger, but certainly, if necessary, other Konstanzers will also warn [Zurich] of impending disaster, despite the resentment concerning the Hütlin matter; its vile expressions as well as the behavior of the Zurich envoys on the day in Baden were reported to Konstanz. Because of the woman in the White Cross, who has frivolously lost her case, he will write next time. Bullinger should write how much [Erasmus’] Paraphrases [“Paraphrasis or explanation of the entire New Testament”] cost in Zurich; in Konstanz, this book is expensive.</p>

      <p>Especially trusted and beloved brother, since the circumstances and times are entirely alarming and dangerous, and I wish you and yours well from the heart, I cannot refrain from writing to you again, which I partly could not do earlier due to haste and partly because of what has happened since.</p>
      <p>Firstly, my lords have not sent any envoys to this Imperial Diet, and although the Landgrave has particularly urged them, alongside the general summons, and requested them to attend this Diet and especially to send my dear cousin Conrat Zwick, he has refused the journey; for it was not much to his liking. After that, the common cities also wrote earnestly to my lords and requested them to send their envoys down. This undoubtedly happened for a great reason. But God has granted that my lords sent no one down, but instead wrote to the cities, as I hereby send you a copy. You may let some good friends, but not many of the council, read it, but ensure that it is not copied by anyone and is returned to me without delay and certainly; for it is of great importance to me, and do not jest in such matters on my behalf, of which I would also be certain if not for special loyalty, love, and friendship.</p>
      <p>We have received credible news that a prophet has arisen in Friesland, who calls himself David Joris, and that he claims to be a forerunner of God's fierce wrath; he has more than fourteen thousand men with him, takes towns and cities, and kills those who do not want to follow him. Doctor Andernach has written here, who made the Sapphic poem that you sent me and which you hereby receive back.</p>
      <p>Also, the mayor Hans Welser from Augsburg writes to me that the King of England is coming over with forty thousand strong to help the Emperor against the French. I also send you his letter so that you can read for yourself what his opinion is regarding the dedication in Luke; you will then know well what to do. I knew beforehand that he is not a Latinist; but that should not mislead you; for it would be an honor for his children, whom he partly educates in learning, as I have written to him myself. Send me his letter back. If you have completed the commentaries on this mass and it is over with the dedication, it does not matter; let me know, we will do the right thing.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Turks, fresh letters from Vienna report that a lot of money has arrived in Buda and Gran to pay the Turkish army, and since the Danube is now navigable, it is feared and expected that the Turk will invade again and cause great damage.</p>
      <p>What you would like to know, which cannot be trusted to the pen, I can truly not write to you again for many reasons; but they are the reasons that move me to my previous and current writing. You may be satisfied with that; for it is enough that you know that this does not happen without very important reasons on my part.</p>
      <p>The plans on both sides, as I have understood from a letter from a very trusted friend who came from the Imperial Diet, are quite wonderful and, as I must fear, largely directed against the Confederates. But that should not frighten you; for if one trusts in the Lord, he can and will turn all things for the best. The other side is just as bad and perhaps worse than you; for there is no improvement with them either. The assistance of the estates is not based on a good foundation; for some do it out of envy, some out of fear, some for their own benefit, some to please the Emperor; some have bad personal matters, behind which they fear for themselves, and do not trust God - much has been written about this.</p>
      <p>But that should not make you proud or presumptuous; for it is also to be feared that God might once impose a punishment on the Confederation. You are in sins like others, are ungrateful for God's blessings, and your being has reached its peak. There are divisions among you; many people's talk and prophecies predict evil for you; it is also the common saying that no empire lasts forever. And although you evangelicals have already stopped the wars and let God's word be preached, there are still great deficiencies among you. But God wants a holy people and, with such great light of grace and his knowledge, a true improvement according to his will. Therefore, I believe that the matters on both sides are very much in and that fortune is solely with God.</p>
      <p>But so that you may assure yourselves of more fortune, it will be of great necessity to consider the matter very diligently and rightly in a Christian manner. And firstly, it would be my opinion that your lords should first of all cease some sins and injustices that are still practiced among their own, and improve themselves in their government as much as possible, and also encourage the other Confederates with Christian admonitions to cease some gross vices that they themselves consider unjust, so that God's wrath may be appeased and mitigated sooner.</p>
      <p>Secondly, everything will depend on whether you are obliged to help the French according to your alliances and agreements to save his land or not. If your lords are obliged, they will be obliged to uphold it. It is also very important to them and all the Confederates that the French are not oppressed, much and more than much. Moreover, it would not benefit your lords much if the French were driven out and they still did not help. However, if your lords are obliged to help, I would think that this should not be done unless the French are attacked in the lands he possessed at the time when your lords allied and united with him. Likewise, that such help should not be granted unless the French first agreed to a peaceful negotiation and, if achieved with the opposite side, a truce.</p>
      <p>If the French agreed to this, then it would be my advice to the Confederates to send a common letter to the estates of the Empire with an indication of the French offer and more, as such could be well arranged.</p>
      <p>If something were to be achieved with the estates, well and good; then one would have a temporary peace, which, as they say, is worth gold. If the matter were settled, that would be luck and salvation and the honor of the Confederates; if it were then broken, it would still stand as before, and one would have experienced the justification and right of both parties, and your lords would know how to conduct themselves better afterwards. If the estates did not agree to a peaceful negotiation, the Confederates' justification would be all the greater, and there would be all the more hope for fortune. But if the French did not agree to a peaceful negotiation without reasonable cause, your lords could more justifiably refuse him help, if he would not allow himself to be moved to fairness. If the other Confederates did not agree with this advice and honorable opinion of your lords, but wanted to help freely without any conditions and prior peaceful negotiation, your lords could then again with more honor and justification refrain from helping and protest to them that they would not want to be blamed for any misfortune that might follow from this.</p>
      <p>And if the other Confederates were then attacked because of this matter and war, they would have a reasonable consideration and it would be well advised to them whether they were obliged by their alliances to save them and help protect their land, since they themselves had given cause for such an undertaking and attack; they should keep this in mind.</p>
      <p>But in case your lords were not obliged to help the French, they could still advise the other Confederates on the above-mentioned opinion, they could also write to the French on their behalf without disadvantage, together with the others, for the sake of peaceful negotiation and upon his agreement to the estates of the Empire. But if the French or the estates of the Empire refused the peaceful negotiation, your lords (since they are not obliged to help) could sit still and thus wait to see how God would arrange the matters.</p>
      <p>Besides, it would still be useful and good in my opinion if the French wrote to those of Strasbourg, but more friendly than threatening, to perhaps prevent them from agreeing to such help; for much depends on them. Likewise, I would still consider the other letter to my lords good, and that it should be done by your lords and the Bernese or the common Confederates (which would be even better), but that it should not be threatening, nor too friendly, so that one does not think one is frightened. This letter would therefore be good, since my lords have not yet received the decision from the Imperial Diet and have not yet approved this help, but (as I certainly believe) will be earnestly requested for it.</p>
      <p>When the Confederates' letter reaches my lords beforehand and they are answered in a friendly manner (as I am then quite sure), it would follow that when the decision or request of the Imperial estates is sent to my lords, they would have good reason because of the Confederates' letter and their answer to keep away from the matters and not to get involved, which would then be for them and likewise for you.</p>
      <p>For if my lords were to go to war (as then gracious and comforting promises of great lords are very powerful and have also happened in previous years), you could well imagine what disadvantage it might bring to the common Confederation, since now is a very different time for war than in previous years.</p>
      <p>What a large number of people you would have to keep waiting for the city, thereby being able to wait less elsewhere. How ruinous it would be for our city, even if the Emperor were to win, is easy to imagine.</p>
      <p>For this matter, it will be helpful that my lords receive a good answer regarding the Hütlin matter; for the previous letter, and that some of the Confederates have taken this matter very seriously, has caused much talk and not a little displeasure among us.</p>
      <p>Secondly, you may well know how my lords have many disputes with the Kreuzlingen Monastery and some serious matters, where the dean keeps saying that he wants to seize our goods, to which our people do not speak well. But God the Lord has given the fortune that about 3 weeks ago my lords offered the dean, since they wanted to live neighborly with everyone, if it pleased him, they would try to settle all disputes amicably. This was achieved with difficulty by my lords; but God has granted grace, and the dean has also agreed amicably. Such negotiation was supposed to take place this week; but my lords have postponed the matter to another time and yet not set a specific time; I do not know, nor can I find out, why this is happening. But I must almost think that the current clamor is a reason; yet some will insist that a date be set for the dean again. If this were to happen, it would truly be good if the dean showed himself friendly, so that the disputes could be laid to rest, or if my lords perhaps demanded too much of the dean, that he would take a friendly approach to his abbot or the Confederates, so that a good will would be maintained with my lords. I have therefore not wanted to withhold from you this good opinion as a good means, and understand it better than the words sound. I write in great haste, but truly and certainly all from a good foundation, as I can then assess these matters for the best possible, and inquire about such things in the best way; God knows why and that I would like to see good neighborliness among us all. The matter often looks bad, as bad blood makes among many; I trust in the faithful God, he will bring good intentions to an end with grace.</p>
      <p>My lords here, as has also happened with you, have appointed some in particular to discuss and advise on these dangerous developments. May God grant that they find the right, pleasing way to him!</p>
      <p>What further decisions will be made at the Imperial Diet or have been made since, I will always inform you as soon as possible and spare no messenger; but I will always pay the messenger's fee.</p>
      <p>For you should always give the fee as before, if it were now too much for the messenger and also perhaps the matter suspicious on my behalf, therefore I also change the messengers and take a different one each time outside the city, so that I am not suspected in any way. There are many strange heads and not everyone is of one mind; when this matter comes to an end, I will then write to you how much I have spent on messenger fees.</p>
      <p>You should not reveal my name to anyone, no matter how dear he may be to you, except to my lord mayor Röist alone. You should also not let my letters be read in the council or by other private persons, but what my lord Röist and you find good in them, you may draw and advise for yourselves; for I write you these things solely from a Christian, brotherly, and trusting heart, for the good of you, us, and our religion. If it should become public on my behalf that I take on these matters as much as I do, as it easily happens, it would bring me considerable disadvantage. Therefore, keep faith with me for God's and love's sake, as I trust you, otherwise I would neither advise you in the future nor write such news to you; you should be completely and finally assured of that. It has troubled me not a little that you have let my long letter be read in the council; for there is something in it that was not suitable to be read. So I must almost think that you have revealed my name to Lavater and Haab, since you wrote me a special greeting from them, which they would not have had reason to commend to you now. You do not know what I fear in all this.</p>
      <p>Also, it seemed good to me that you think further about the other secret matter I wrote to you about before. For in a few days, two letters have come to N., indicating that the King and the Landgrave will write to my lords' secret councils about this matter; for N. has previously given an answer to both places, the inventor has dealt with the secret councils of this city, they wanted to consider the matter and asked to keep it secret for a while. Now these two lords will insist with my lords; if my lords were then moved by great promises to advise N. or not to advise against opening the matter, that would not be good. May God arrange it for the best! Think about it; I will do the same; for it will be of great, great importance, especially with this miserable clamor. May the Father in heaven set his merciful eyes upon us for good. Amen, amen.</p>
      <p>I do not write you a greeting from anyone this time; there are important reasons why I do not tell anyone about it. It does not suit the persons you write about, also for not insignificant reasons; but what I can learn and hear about them and others, I will not keep hidden from you, although I know that if something special were to happen that might bring particular disadvantage to your city, they would, as far as they could do it properly, not withhold it from you, regardless of the fact that indeed some resentment has arisen and settled among some because of the Hütlin matter; for they have come across some very strange experiences of certain words that Hütlin has poured out in a place where he thought little that it would be carried further, and there are also some conjectures and not insignificant ones on the days in Baden, also concerning your envoys, which have been added, so that one must take Hütlin's words for true, which has burdened some of my lords, as far as they know, more than highly and severely.</p>
      <p>But let that remain with you, do not tell anyone about it. I was truly not inclined to write to you about it; I would have done so in previous letters, but I only mentioned it in general about the unfaithfulness and speed of the children of men; it is a wonderfully strange adventurous matter.</p>
      <p>Regarding the woman in the White Cross, I will write to you later; she has badly mismanaged her case, is herself to blame, as you will hear; otherwise, it would have been resolved soon.</p>
      <p>Write to me with this messenger how else I might buy the large German Paraphrases from you, and do not forget it; they are very expensive here, namely 2 1/2 fl. unbound. But you should not give the messenger any until further notice.</p>
      <p>Given on the 26th of March in the morning after six o'clock 1544.</p>
