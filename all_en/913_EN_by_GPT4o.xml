      <p> Greetings. To your letter, dearest compadre in the Lord, which you wrote on May 14th, I have not yet been able to respond, because I only returned to Basel the day before yesterday, where I submitted my Psalter to the press of Hervagius; may the Lord grant that its printing proceeds successfully. You think they are made of stone, not flesh, if there are any who are not moved by the misery of the churches of Christ, which are in great danger concerning the essence of true religion. It is indeed so. However, unless I am completely mistaken, there are very few who are affected by the calamity of such notable churches with any sense of sympathy, and this evil is not only discovered in these perilous times, but even among those who are still outside the range of the attacks, there is no true communication of Christian love, so that we seem to be like scattered brooms. </p>
      <p> Therefore, it is extremely necessary, as you write, that we implore the Lord's mercy night and day. In Basel, I perceived a certain dark cloud arising, threatening a warlike storm, yet it cannot be known for certain where it will lead. </p>
      <p> I congratulate you on the marriage of your daughter Margaretha and pray to the Lord that He sanctifies it with His blessing to the glory of His name. When Birckmann from Cologne comes to you, I beg you not to forget my cause; for he is, unless I am mistaken, the one to whom Hervagius entrusted the manuscript intended for the King of England to be returned to our Bernardino. Regarding our Gervasius, it is finally, I hope, taken care of. Farewell very well, dearest compadre. I was not able to write to Mr. Butler; I beg you to convey my greetings to him and to all the other lords and brothers, and especially to your whole household in my name. Bern, May 26, 1550. </p>
      <p> Wolfgang Musculus, your compadre in the Lord. To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, lord and dearest compadre in Christ. </p>
      <p> Zürich. </p>
