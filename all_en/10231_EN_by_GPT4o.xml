      <p>Greetings, my venerable Bullinger.</p>
      <p>After almost two full years with the churches of Swabia, I have now returned to Konstanz, which I thought it best to inform you of as soon as possible, so that we can write to each other more familiarly and conveniently, and happily confirm the friendship begun several years ago with the agreement of both nature and, especially, the studies of Christ.</p>
      <p>Indeed, after that grave calamity, I greatly congratulated the church of Zurich for having such a bishop, who is equal to Zwingli in many gifts and surpasses him in many others, and I pray to Christ that He may graciously impart His spirit to you, so that you may perform your duty, which you do, with strength and perseverance. For as far as your church is concerned, I think the exercise of a heavier cross has not been disadvantageous to it, so that it is now much stronger in itself and the fear of the Lord shines forth much more clearly from weakness, however much those who have been given to sordid work may become more sordid. For thus Christ cleanses His threshing floor with the fan of the cross, so that those who are approved may become manifest. As you, my dearest brother, perceive most acutely and clearly without a monitor, how much diligent circumspection and singular modesty is needed by him who wishes to vindicate the churches of Christ from intemperance, namely the occasion of many evils. Luther's tragedy, which he now stirs up anew in his letter to the people of Frankfurt concerning the long-controversial matter of the supper, if I judge rightly, must be consistently ignored by us, since his disposition cannot be softened by any hard or gentle treatment, but rather seems to provoke hornets, who would wish to do the same as he. However, the minds of our people are sufficiently fortified, so that they are not moved by the authority of anyone or by the not very soberly explained opinions of the scriptures. Moreover, it will be a most delightful spectacle for the adversaries of both, the papists, if we continue to fight in this way and bite and devour each other in turn, not to mention the great loss of most precious time, which we make when we deal with Luther's antagonists in no way and to no end. How much better it is to devote those good hours to good and useful arguments, which the present state of all things abundantly supplies. But I know well that you, because of your genuine modesty of mind and most gentle disposition, are more than others most devoted to peace and tranquility.</p>
      <p>I have nothing new here to cheer you with, except that an agreement could not be reached between the emperor and the pope regarding the council. However, the emperor is hastening his voyage to Spain and is entirely intent on ensuring that the Swabian league or rather complicity is bound together with an indissoluble bond and is renewed as if from the beginning, which he will obtain with difficulty from some princes, and not at all from others. The Palatine, Mainz, Trier, and Hesse are already joined in a private and singular league and are trying everything to bind others to themselves as well. The Christian cities themselves completely reject the previous arrangement of the league and freely want the cause of religion and entirely of Christ. The prince of Bavaria is still troubled by the election of the Roman king, and stubbornly resents Ferdinand for this reason and cannot be appeased even by some magnificent conditions offered, with which the emperor tries to soothe him. But so far he achieves nothing. This matter is thought to be about to cause disturbances and storms in the Roman empire. The French king is colluding with some princes and seems to be nurturing some kind of monster. We must therefore more anxiously and diligently pray to Christ that He may gently moderate these various and heated plans of the princes, so that we may be safe and at peace by His grace.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my soul, and be assured that I am most observant and loving of you. I wish to be commended by you to the most excellent men Pellican, Leo, Theodor, and the other fellow ministers. My dearest brother, Zuiccius, and the rest greet you. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, March 22, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>The churches of the Swabians are doing quite well. I pray that the spirit of Christ may continually invigorate and nurture them, so that I may someday see the commendable increase of my planting and watering, and that they may be my joy and crown in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of the church of Zurich, to be observed as a brother, etc.</p>
