    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's letter, which he received on November 20; has sent too much material to [Heinrich] Falkner, who particularly complained about the black cloth; however, he should buy it for the favorable price of 20 guilders or deposit it with Bullinger until further notice. Is surprised that the good fabric is too expensive for the Zurich merchants, as he sold it to Falkner at the same price the previous year; Falkner should return this fabric to him at the next Frankfurt Spring Fair, along with three reams of the best paper - this letter paper should be taken as an example - from [Christoph] Froschauer; if even better is available, Falkner should send more for Miles Coverdale and the other Englishmen [in Strasbourg]; Froschauer should pay Bullinger the price for the half black cloth for the agreed purpose if Falkner returns it; Hilles will reimburse the amount in Frankfurt. The remaining half cloths should be sold by Falkner or sent back to Frankfurt. Did not expect a statement on the theses sent [by Capito and Bucer, No. 1569], but wanted to hear Bullinger's opinion on them during his next visit. Greetings to Falkner and thanks for sending the butter; has received Bullinger's [penultimate] letter "a Gallo vom Homberg," as already mentioned; further greetings. Has sent fenugreek to John Burcher in Basel.</p>

      <p>Strasbourg, November 23, 1541.</p>
      <p>May the consolation of the Holy Spirit be with you in your knowledge, which sometimes has much associated sorrow. I received your most welcome letter on November 20, most learned man. I am immensely grateful that you love me as a brother (as I have often understood from your writings before). I regret sending so much cloth to Falkner, as he is very upset that I sent him so many pieces. I would not have sent the unshorn black cloth, about which he complains, to Falkner (as I believe you understood well from my previous letters), if his letters had not been delivered to me so late in Frankfurt. Nevertheless, I cannot give him the cloth for 18 guilders, as it cost me more than 20 guilders in England. However, since it is already there (especially since it has such thick threads and hard wool), if he wants to keep it for 20 guilders, I will be content. If not, I kindly ask you to take the cloth back from him and keep it with you until I write to you again at the next fair, or earlier. For I might want to use it for another purpose (if Falkner refuses it).</p>
      <p>I did not value the shorn cloth at more than 28 guilders. I gave Falkner such a cloth at the same price at the last Strasbourg fair. But regarding that cloth (since it seems so expensive to your merchants), I do not know what to write, except to ask Mr. Falkner to return it to me during Lent, through some coachman known to him who is traveling to Frankfurt through this city. I have no doubt that I will sell that cloth here for the same price or perhaps more. If Falkner returns this cloth, he will greatly oblige me if he also sends three reams of the best paper, which Mr. Froschauer produces. (A ream contains 20 booklets: in German, it is called ein Riecks.) For I greatly desire such paper as his. I wrote this letter on one sheet of the paper I desire; but if he has better, I would like one or two more reams for Miles Coverdale and other Englishmen here. For this paper, I will, God willing, settle with Froschauer or Mr. Falkner at the upcoming fair. I also wish that Mr. Froschauer would pay you 15 guilders and 12 batz for me there, for the half of the whole shorn black cloth, for the purposes your piety knows, if Falkner returns it to me; and I will faithfully repay Froschauer the same guilders in Frankfurt.</p>
      <p>The other half cloths you wrote about please me well: namely, on the condition that Falkner will keep them, so that if he can sell them, he will pay me the money at the next fair; otherwise, he will hand them over to the person I will later indicate to him in Frankfurt. I did not send the theses to your erudition to have your opinion on them; for I did not wish to hinder your studies for my sake: yet I am very grateful that, when I come, you will not disdain to give me your judgment on them. Please greet Mr. Falkner, my dear brother, and thank him greatly on my behalf for the butter; for it will be of good use to my family this winter. I also ask him to remember the paper I mentioned above. He asked me to inform him whether I have received your letters from Gallo von Homberg: I indicated to your kindness in my last letters that I have received them. I intend to send a quarter of fenugreek with this messenger, if he does not refuse to carry it with him. My wife sends her regards to yours; you will also greet her on my behalf. May God Almighty keep you from harmful pestilence and protect you under His wing, so that His kingdom may be further propagated through you on earth, and your reward may be all the greater in heaven. Amen.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, R. HILLES.</p>
      <p>I have sent the fenugreek to Basel to John Burcher, the Englishman, residing at the house of Mr. Miconius or Isengrin.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest friend. Zurich.</p>
