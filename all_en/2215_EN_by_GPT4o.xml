      <p>Greetings. I have arranged for the booklets you requested to be brought by our booksellers from the Frankfurt market. However, the catalog of books printed here this semester could not be obtained due to the busy schedule of the printers preparing for the fair; but once they have returned, I will ensure that you receive it at the first opportunity.</p>
      <p>I will not fail your relative, as you trust me, and I will attend to all opportunities; for not only does your goodwill towards me deserve this, but also the benefits with which you favor me, undeserving as I am, for which I am greatly thankful to you.</p>
      <p>I have received the treatise on Justification and the second book of our Gesner on egg-laying quadrupeds; I am delighted and educated by both. I have sent the rest to Strasbourg and Richenweier, as you wished. I have received nothing new beyond what you already know, except that our Celius reported that in England two armies have been gathered, one by the Duke of Suffolk, the other by Ovetus, and they have agreed to a meeting with the Queen (which she seeks) to the extent that the Bishop of Winchester is to be given as a hostage. Also, the Emperor was ready for an expedition to cross into England to assist the Queen, but was advised by some that he would have the most hostile French army at his back if he moved, and thus, having changed his plan, he stayed put. Moreover, an Englishman recently informed our Oporinus that the Queen is triumphing over her defeated enemies, which I hope is false; however, the same person who reports this also narrates that Ovetus has been captured, as he heard in Strasbourg. Farewell with your wife, children, and fellow brothers, whom I wish you to greet respectfully in my words. Basel, March 8, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord and fellow.</p>
