      <p>Greetings. At this very hour, as I am writing this, we have deliberated about appointing another theologian in place of Hyperius, who was denied to us by the Landgrave, for the Lausanne school, and I have obtained what I desired, that all the brothers agreed on Mr. Zanchi.</p>
      <p>However, it was decided that, if it pleases the senate, he should first be solicited through private letters, so that if we have his consent, he can later be more conveniently called by the senate. And I am now approaching the senate about this matter.</p>
      <p>Since the messenger here cannot wait for my return from the senate, I ask in one word that you let me know as soon as possible what you think about this matter. I know that he is very useful to the Strasbourg school and that it would not be in the interest of that church if he were called away; but our necessity and the loyalty I owe to this school and republic of ours make me lean more towards having him become ours; however, I will also listen to your advice. Write to me in Aarau or Bruges; for on the 24th of this month I will be in Aarau and on the 26th in Bruges to celebrate synods there, and I hope my brother will come down to me in Bruges.</p>
      <p>I would indeed like to come up to you myself; but I do not know if I can now. Whatever happens with that, write to me so that I can inform Musculus of it soon; for the matter cannot bear much delay, as the theological professorship in Lausanne has been vacant for too long. I will write about other matters at another time.</p>
      <p>I would like, if it is not inconvenient for you, for you to come to us in Bruges as well; Mr. Claudius from Madiis will be there with me.</p>
      <p>All of ours send you loving greetings; I also pray for greetings to all of yours. In Bern, May 18th, at 8 in the morning.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his dearest and most esteemed lord and compatriot.</p>
