      <p>Grace and peace through our Lord Jesus Christ, I wish you for the New Year; may He grant that we spend it according to His will. Amen.</p>
      <p>Revered and kind lord and friend, my willing service is always at your disposal. I have always received your letters, sent through messengers and also through St. Gallen, along with your previous letters, books, and booklets, as mentioned in your letters. My wife and I thank you for such gifts, with the promise to reciprocate, though this time the shortness of time (as the messenger stayed here for no more than a day and a half) may not allow it. I have also delivered your letter along with your Confession to both church servants in response. Although it has been 8 days since I returned home from Lyon, I have only just received your package and have received and read your letter with joy; we would have gladly written a reply, but due to the shortness of time, it was not possible this time. It shall be done with the next available messenger. I was also entirely intending to ride out from Lyon to visit you at home, as I have often promised you, but I could not have so much company, as it is somewhat out of the way and the weather is rough, which prevented me from riding there; it shall happen at another convenient time, God willing, if we are still alive, otherwise we are united in spirit.</p>
      <p>Also, you desire that I let you know if I have any news from Prussia from Mr. Johann Laski. As I hear, he is said to have long since passed away in God, but I have not received any further response to your letter.</p>
      <p>Concerning the Count Palatine, he is still constantly in Amberg, aiming to establish a Christian reformation there, but since the people there are rough, and also betrayed by their preachers to such an extent, it does not take place. It is said that he forbade one of them the pulpit, who preached more for rebellion than for edification. Because of this, he and his brother of grace are said to have become discontented; also a mandate from the imperial majesty has come, prohibiting further progress in this matter. Thus, our preachers here are also vehement in the pulpits, so the Christian church is attacked in many ways and paths. May God have mercy on us and grant us His Holy Spirit, so that we may come to a true understanding of His divine word.</p>
      <p>Also, on the 25th of December, a sudden war broke out here, as Duke August, along with the allied Franconian circle, in which our lords here are also included, besieged a fortification in the land called Dorringen Gotha, in which those who were declared outlaws of the Empire at the last Reichstag are said to be. There is much to write about this. It is to be feared that this war will spread far, which is then the fault of our great sins.</p>
      <p>Some suspect that it might also affect the Count Palatine, as the bishops are also involved. All this gives time to recognize.</p>
      <p>The campaign in Hungary has come to an end this year; some troops have remained there in garrison. It is to be feared that in the spring the Turk will advance with force, so that we have war within and outside the land, which is then a punishment upon us; may God grant us understanding.</p>
      <p>Herewith some tracts, what has happened this past summer in Hungary; it is not worth the effort to read; also the counterfeits, seals, and bull and the landscape of Hungary. And I hereby commend myself to you in all service, and may you be greeted by me and my wife, and be commended in your prayers. With whatever is dear and serviceable to you at any time, and I commend you to the protection and care of the Most High.</p>
      <p>Given in haste in Nuremberg on the 3rd of January, 1567. Your willing servant, Gabriel Schl√ºsselberger.</p>
