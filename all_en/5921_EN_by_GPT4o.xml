      <p>Greetings. Lest you suspect that I am negligent in responding, know that your letter written on August 27th was only delivered to me this evening, October 22nd; where it has been hiding for so long, I do not know.</p>
      <p>I have understood from it, which greatly pained my heart, that we have been bereaved of the most pious and steadfast man, Mr. Johannes Travers.</p>
      <p>In this one man, Rhaetia has lost much, and the churches have lost a singular patron.</p>
      <p>However, since the divine will has so desired, and he was an old man who could not have lived much longer comfortably, and he departed to the Lord in firm faith, we must again accept consolation and pray to God that, with the removal of this excellent man, He may provide us with another excellent one, just as He once substituted Elisha in the place of Elijah.</p>
      <p>Regarding our son Johannes, I have heard nothing since the day he passed through here and greeted me.</p>
      <p>I will ensure that your letters are safely delivered to him; indeed, tomorrow a certain Baptista from Locarno will descend to Basel, to whom I will entrust them.</p>
      <p>Mr. Hieronymus Zanchi is a very learned man from Bergamo, skilled in languages, well-versed in ancient writers, an acute and practiced disputant, eloquent and tireless, and he has been known to me for a long time in the ministry of Christ.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, together with Mr. Martyr of blessed memory, he professed, and for the same reason that Martyr could not grieve, Zanchi wished to depart.</p>
      <p>However, I do not know why he has not yet ascended; I fear that something adverse may happen to him; for the Lutherans hate him most vehemently.</p>
      <p>Matters and time, when spring arrives, will provide counsel on where to send your son.</p>
      <p>We hear here that in France, seeds of dissension are being sown again. However, I affirm nothing for certain.</p>
      <p>Yet I think that with the Guises existing in power in France, there will be no solid peace.</p>
      <p>May the Lord judge.</p>
      <p>For certain, it is reported here that serious disturbances are arising in Germany and soldiers are being enlisted everywhere; but since I have nothing certain, I prefer not to write more about these matters.</p>
      <p>You wish to know how I am, my lord and brother: as well as I can be. Daily I feel the strength of my spirit weakening, as it is broken by constant cares and labors; I suffer more frequently from severe headaches and other infirmities, which reminds me to pack my bags and prepare for my most desired journey.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord for me always, that He may be with me and protect me from evil.</p>
      <p>I wish Julius from Milan and other brothers well. Farewell, most friendly man.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless you and yours.</p>
      <p>Zurich, October 22nd, in the evening, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Friedrich von Salis, a foremost man among the Rhaetians, my esteemed lord and most sincere friend.</p>
      <p>In Samaden.</p>
