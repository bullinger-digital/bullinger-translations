    <p xml:id="regest1">Allows himself to present his request to Bullinger without long-winded phrases: Since the death of Hans Frick (Fritz) [1535], he has received on loan one of the four inheritances from his relative [Anna Gräß] - about 50 guilders, which were only to be paid out if she were to leave her convent [Grünenberg] -, but now he must pay the money immediately because it has been demanded in Zurich by her brother [Simon Gräß] from Constance, to whom she has assigned the inheritance; he wants to avoid legal action by Hans Hager, the bailiff of [Anna Gräß], at all costs and therefore asks Bullinger to present the matter to the mayor [Heinrich Walder] and, if necessary, to consult his brother [Jakob]. He is about to depart for Lausanne.</p>

      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed patron.</p>
      <p>Greetings. The fact that I write to you, most humane man, without any preambles, but almost abruptly and without any prior reproach, you will interpret no differently than that I am so certain and secure of your goodwill and humanity that I think none of these are necessary with you. Now indeed, what I most wish, I will also say simply and briefly: Upon the death of Mr. Hans Frick (Fritz), my relative, the four heirs of the estate (among whom my mother was also one) each receive a third, one of which belonged to my mother's sister, who is still in a convent near the small town of Stein, and therefore it was agreed among the remaining three heirs that they would not grant the due part to the nun sister until she had left the convent. Therefore, they wanted to give it to someone who would in the meantime pay the nun sister only the twentieth interest annually, but would not be obliged to release the principal of the inheritance until the nun sister either left her religion or had died. Then I, by some fortune, took on that sum of the inheritance, about fifty guilders, under the conditions as prescribed. Hager, the elected guardian of the nun, gave it to me, delivering now these, now other parts of the inheritance over a year and a half. For he gave the first part in April 1535, the last in August 1536, nor did I care to receive everything at once. For he had promised that the time for interest would not be counted until I had received everything. Meanwhile, it happened that the nun sister donated her entire part to her brother, who resides in Constance, who immediately came to Zurich and demanded the goods from Hager, the guardian. Finally, it was decided before the senate that Hager should immediately return the goods to the man from Constance. Meanwhile, I, unaware of the matter and engaged in other things, came to Zurich, then I was immediately summoned to court by Hager; for the entire sum had to be paid to the man from Constance within one or two days. The senate again pronounced that Hager should pay at this time, but reserved the right to take legal action against me later. Therefore, I preferred to settle the matter privately with Hager and even to provide more than I seemed to be legally compelled to. For I immediately gave the 14 guilders received from you, promising to give about 20 guilders around the festival of Felix and Regula, and the remaining perhaps 12½ guilders, no more (for I had given something at the beginning, so that it was only 46, not more than 50), the remaining, I say, without any set day, as soon as I could, to be paid. Hager then accepted that condition, now he refuses again, and demands the whole amount to be paid, threatens to sell the furniture I have left in Zurich in the market, to send collectors at my expense, unless he wins the case with my mother, because of the bail, which however she only guaranteed that the goods would be returned when the nun sister had left the convent or had died. Therefore, so that this mark of infamy is not branded upon me, that my affairs are publicly sold under the hammer, as if I had not kept faith with creditors or as if I were a man of luxury and wickedness, you will be my protection if you present my case, as soon as you have read this letter, to the mayor, how unjustly it would be decided if I am forced to return in one day what I received over a year and a half, if I am compelled to return all at once what I should not have had to pay for several years after the death or departure of the nun from the convent, if finally, what Hager himself very recently promised, now when the day of payment has come, he refuses to accept. I implore you, most excellent man, by Christ, than whom I have nothing greater, to immediately indicate upon reading the letter that it should be consulted, to also inform others, if you think it necessary. If you have not understood the whole matter, you can be informed by my brother.</p>
      <p>These, as you see, were written quickly and carelessly, for in one hour I had to begin my journey to Lausanne.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my unique Maecenas.</p>
      <p>Basel, 19th of September 1537.</p>
      <p>Your Conr. Gesner.</p>
