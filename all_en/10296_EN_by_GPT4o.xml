    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks Bullinger for sending the commentary on the Acts of the Apostles. Has nothing of equal value to offer. It is important to defend the Kingdom of Christ against Satan with united forces.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord, esteemed Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I give you the greatest thanks, dear Bullinger, for the exceptional gift of your writings on the Acts. We have nothing to offer in return that would match it. Otherwise, we would strive to reciprocate. You do well to defend your own, but with me, who wishes them well no less than you do, there is no need. Let us both strive to inflame the zeal for Christ more. Here, indeed, it is waning among many, but the Lord still has his own. Satan leaves nothing undone to attack the Kingdom of Christ. We must, therefore, strive more to defend it.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently. Nothing new here.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, September 23.</p>
      <p>Your Bucer.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the pious, learned, vigilant pastor of Zurich, dearest brother.</p>
