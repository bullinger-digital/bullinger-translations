      <p>Proposals of certain seditious citizens in the western part of Britain:</p>
      <p>First, we want all general councils and holy decrees of the fathers to be observed and anyone contradicting them to be considered a heretic. Also, we want the laws of King Heinrich VIII, which pertain to the Six Articles, to be restored to their former authority.</p>
      <p>Also, we want the Mass to be celebrated in Latin as before by the priest with no one else communicating together.</p>
      <p>Also, we want the host to hang over the high altar and be adored there as usual, and those not consenting to be put to death as heretics against the holy Catholic faith.</p>
      <p>Also, we want the sacrament of the altar to be distributed to laypeople only at Easter and only in one kind.</p>
      <p>Also, we want the minister to baptize both on the remaining days of the week and on Sunday.</p>
      <p>Also, we want bread and water to be sanctified every Sunday, and palms and ashes at their proper times, images in every temple, and all other ceremonies of the ancients used in our holy mother church to be restored.</p>
      <p>Also, we do not want to admit the new form of preaching, because it is like a game, but we desire the old form of matins, Mass, vespers, and processions to be celebrated in Latin as before, and thus we Cornish, some of whom do not understand English, utterly reject the new manner of the English language.</p>
      <p>Also, we want every minister to pray by name in the sermon and the priest in the Mass for the souls that are in purgatory, as our ancestors used to do.</p>
      <p>Also, we want the Bible and all commentaries written in English to be revoked; otherwise, we understand that the clergy will not refute heretics for a long time.</p>
      <p>Also, we want Doctors Mormann and Crispin, who support our opinions, to be sent to us, and we ask the king to grant them certain stipends so that they can preach our Catholic faith among us.</p>
      <p>Also, it seems to us that Cardinal Pole, because he is in the service of the king, should not only be granted pardon but also be summoned here from Rome and be included in the king's council.</p>
      <p>Also, we want no nobleman to retain more than one servant in his service unless he has two hundred and fifty gold coins annually, and whenever that number is doubled, the number of servants should be increased accordingly.</p>
      <p>Also, we want half of the lands of monasteries and chantries, in whose dominion they may be and by whatever means they have come to them, to be restored in two places where two of the principal monasteries in any dominion have been, from which such half part is to be taken away, and there we want a place to be confirmed for devout men who will pray for the king and the republic, and there all public alms of the seven-year period to be referred.</p>
      <p>Also, concerning those things that displease us in our republic, we want them to be constituted in such a way as Humfrid Danudell and Heinrich Braius Bodman, the prefect, will signify to the royal majesty, if only they have access by royal authority.</p>
      <p>In Stra√üburg, 25 August 1549.</p>
