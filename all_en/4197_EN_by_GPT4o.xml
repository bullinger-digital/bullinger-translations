      <p>Greetings. I am grateful to you, dearest godfather in the Lord, for not refusing my request despite your own occupations. Your advice is pleasing; for I also wrote the same to our Lelio, namely that it should be feared that I might do something more displeasing than pleasing to Maximilian because of his parent, and perhaps also stir up some trouble for myself. Therefore, I persist in what I have considered regarding the Palatinate for certain particular reasons that intervene with me and the Palatinate, under which I lived before Christ my Savior called me out of the papal darkness through the light and grace of His gospel. I could have abundantly learned everything necessary for this cause from Wilhelm, the deacon of Heidelberg, when he was here, but I neglected such a convenient opportunity because I had not yet decided what to do. He obtained letters from our senate to the elector, yet in the meantime, he has not written a word, so we do not know how and where he is now; if you have any information about him, I beg you to let me know. Regarding the New Year's gift of this year, which you sent to our mutual godson Johann Heinrich as a token of your goodwill, I am writing for the third time; therefore, I am greatly surprised at where my letters to you have gone. Whatever the case, I, along with him, give you the greatest thanks we can, and we pray to the Lord that you may continue to do what you do until the hundredth year of your life. Farewell excellently, dearest godfather.</p>
      <p>I wish health to your entire household.</p>
      <p>All of mine send greetings to you and yours.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 22, 1560.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Musculus, your godfather in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and dearest godfather.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
