      <p>Greetings. Since I had found a very reliable messenger who could certainly deliver my letters to you, honorable man and dear brother, I wanted to write these few lines to renew our old and never-dying friendship, and at the same time send two booklets, one for you and the other for your father, my always dearest brother; a small gift indeed, but from the best of hearts. Several sermons on Jeremiah are being printed again, of which I will also send a copy, if I live. From England, we received certain letters written by distinguished and very friendly men from London on the 21st of May, which testify that the parliament, as they call the council of the whole kingdom, was finally dissolved on the 8th of May. It had deliberated on the affairs of the kingdom for a long time, since the month of January; they say, however, that it was dissolved peacefully and successfully. Peace has been made with the kings of France and Scotland; the kingdom, which was greatly weakened by Mary, has been taken care of again. The Reformation of Edward VI, of blessed memory, is ordered to be restored throughout the kingdom.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the mass has been abolished, and the Roman pontiff and church have been renounced.</p>
      <p>His jurisdiction, which he claimed for himself, has been taken away and given to the queen. She accepted it, but refused to accept the title of head of the church; she is called the governor. She sent visitors to the schools to reform them, and also to the bishoprics, to initiate reformation there. Preachers were sent along, and I wish there were more for such a great kingdom.</p>
      <p>The bishops have been put in order; their wealth and secular dominion are taken from them, and therefore the Archbishop of York resigned to the queen.</p>
      <p>From the supporters and professors of our religion, Dr. Parker has been made Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Grindal Bishop of London, Dr. Cox Bishop of Norwich, etc.</p>
      <p>Other pious and learned men are being substituted for the departing bishops who do not wish to bear the yoke of Christ. This is what we have from England, which I wanted to share with you and yours, so that you may praise the Lord with me. Some are working for England to accept the Augsburg Confession and alliance, etc.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord that the most flourishing kingdom may steadfastly persevere with Christ, whom it has received. You will share this with your father, who is also very dear to me, and whom you will greet.</p>
      <p>Finally, greet the fellow ministers and brothers of your church. How I grieve that the pastor of Paleopolis, Spiller, has been thrown into chains; but the iniquity of the Amorites is not yet complete. Let us pray to the Lord to deliver us from the tyranny of those who seek our souls and to extinguish and trample the gospel. Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory and help us, our saving God, for the glory of your name. Live and farewell and love me with all good things.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, the last day of June 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Dr. Josua Ke√üler, chief scribe of the Republic of St. Gallen, his esteemed lord and dearest brother. To the lord city scribe in St. Gallen.</p>
