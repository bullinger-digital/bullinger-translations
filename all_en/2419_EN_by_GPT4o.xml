      <p>Greetings. I hear, most esteemed and revered sir, that you have been recalled to France, and indeed willingly and at your request. I would have preferred to enjoy your presence longer, if it could have been done for your convenience. But since I understand from friends that your kindness inclines you to return, I truly congratulate you on this happiness. I know with what great labors, care, and trouble you have sustained this mission, and indeed for a long time and in a difficult place; from which I infer how much you have desired to be free from these troubles.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is fitting that you not only give thanks to the God, the giver of all good things, with your mouth, but also shape your entire life in gratitude according to His will. You have lived for this world until now, you have served your most powerful king, our Lord and God in heaven, immortal, all-knowing, and most loving of the human race; therefore, dedicate the rest of your life to Him, serve this Creator, Prince, Redeemer, and your Lord in faith, truth, justice, and holiness. While it is allowed to enjoy the light, walk in the light. Let us not neglect the opportunity; for He who is now the most faithful Redeemer and Intercessor will be on that day indeed the most severe Judge, but in the meantime the most just. O happy are we if in our death and on that day we are found in the service not of men, but of our Liberator, Christ the Lord. O blessed are we if we hear Him proclaiming: "Well done, good and faithful servant, you have been faithful over a few things, I will make you ruler over many things; enter into the joy of your Lord." There, indeed, what eye has not seen nor ear heard, the Lord has prepared for those who love Him; there we will see each other mutually by the grace of God, to whom it was never granted here to converse more familiarly. Meanwhile, I am compelled to lack your letters. I know with what danger you would write to me from France, and therefore I do not ask; I know how disliked I am by many because of my preaching, which I strive to propagate as widely as possible by voice and writing, and will continue to do so as long as the spirit governs the body. I have long known that I, along with my books, have been expelled and condemned in France, and it does not frighten me; for I know whom I have believed, and I rejoice with a clear conscience before the Lord.</p>
      <p>Therefore, there is no reason for you ever to regret our familiarity and friendship. I hope finally that your piety understands that I am not an enemy of religion, but of superstition and abuses. If there is anything more that remains to be revealed to you, I pray to God the Father through the Lord Jesus Christ, that He may enlighten the eyes of your mind to understand the things that are for the glory of God and the salvation of your soul. And may I someday hear that my dear Basse-Fontaine, having left Babylon, has entirely joined the camp of Christ the Redeemer. Meanwhile, I will never forget you in my prayers nor cease to pursue you with sincere love. However, even if this is perhaps the last thing I will write to your love, I will not cease to commend your salvation to the Father of mercies with pious and perpetual prayers. Farewell, farewell forever. May the Lord Jesus be the guide of your way; may He keep you, enlighten you, and consecrate you entirely to Himself alone, whom He has long washed with His blood and strives to reform by His word and spirit to His image, to whose likeness you are created with all the faithful. Zürich, October 8, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Heinrich Bullinger. To the most esteemed sir, the Lord of Basse-Fontaine, the most Christian King of the French's envoy to the Swiss, his most revered lord. Solothurn.</p>
      <p>In my haste, I forgot to especially request your kindness to deal with the new envoy, so that he does not show himself more unfavorably to the most splendid cities of Zürich and Bern, and to the cantons and others following a different religion, but rather presents himself as equitable and does not oppose himself in good and just matters to the cities nor hate those who are known to be friends, not enemies, of the king and the kingdom, even if they have declined that new alliance for great reasons.</p>
      <p>And you, especially, my lord, be careful not to be harsher upon your return to France against the confessors of the Gospel of Christ, nor pollute your tongue (counsel) or hands with innocent blood. "He who touches you," says the Lord, "touches the apple of my eye" and "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called the children of God," etc. I know why I say this: you will be called to councils. May the Lord keep you forever.</p>
