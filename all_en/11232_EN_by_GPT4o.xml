    <p xml:id="regest1">Can only briefly inform that the university is moving to Mulhouse, while he, on the advice of Grynaeus, is heading to Strasbourg; he has paid Myconius [the board money] and asks to reimburse him for the borrowed gulden, which he had to request from him as travel money after purchasing Plutarch. Sends the booklets printed by Winkeli. Stephan [Willi] will report on the reason for the flight, the plague; Gwalther wishes that his books be loaned to [Willi]. Greetings. Recommendation for Johann [Wilhelm] Reiffenstein.</p>

      <p>Greetings most abundant.</p>
      <p>I would like to write more now, most kind teacher, but the importunity of the sailors compels me to hurry. The entire university is heading to Mulhouse along with the professors. On the advice of Mr. Grynaeus, I will temporarily go to Strasbourg. I now ask you to consider my situation with fairness and kindness. For when I happened to come to the port to inquire about the ship, they were already preparing to depart. I have settled accounts with Mr. Myconius and paid him, who now lent me a gulden, which I beg you to send back to him through Balthasar. For I was short of money after buying Plutarch in Greek, although not entirely, but I thought it was not safe to undertake such a journey without a sufficient supply of money. I am sending the booklets printed by Winkeli. Stephan will explain the reason for my flight; for two in our house are suffering from the plague. You will again lend some of my books to Stephan; for while I was with him, he benefited me not a little with his books.</p>
      <p>Farewell, venerable father, and greet your entire family most warmly in my name. October 22, from the house of Myconius.</p>
      <p>Rodolf Gwalther, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>A noble young man, Johann Wilhelm von Riffenstein, a youth of remarkable talent, will come to you, I believe, whom I earnestly ask you to have recommended to you.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious man H. Bullinger, his most esteemed patron.</p>
