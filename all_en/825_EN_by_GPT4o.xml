      <p>Honorable, highly learned lord and friend Bullinger, my willing, unknown service is always at your disposal. I sent a letter to your honor last autumn through Michl Mayr, a citizen and bow maker in Zurich, and I believe your honor has received it and understood its contents. Now, in response to this letter, I have again sent a letter to Mayr, which was not at home but in Constance, and I have not been able to reach your honor again through a missive, which is done with all good intentions and friendship, considering that many years ago I was in Zurich with the dear man Zwingli and others, discussing and debating the then pressing issue of the sacrament, and left with a satisfied conscience. Now, last year, your honor published and sold Commentaries on the New Testament, which I have partly seen and am pleased with. Your honor has also published more books, as I find, which are hidden from me, especially De origine erroris and others.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my friendly request is to send me an index, also what of them has been published, with an indication of where I might obtain them for a reasonable price, for what comes from your office I accept with all modesty along with your church, though with me (since your name is hated by many innocents) little is kept in the city here, who trust each other in this village.</p>
      <p>Recent news with us cannot be withheld from your honor, there has now been a diet held in Munich after the Epiphany, in which the prince was granted two hundred thousand guilders, his highness's son Duke Albrecht twelve thousand annually, the old lord twenty thousand annually from the levy for five years, his highness's wife was honored with five thousand guilders.</p>
      <p>Following the young lord's wife was received into the land with ten thousand guilders, who came down on January 19th, brought a son, whom the bishop of Passau, a lord of Salm, lifted from the baptism and named with the ominous name Ferdinand. Furthermore, in the diet, a lord named Messendorfer, who was in the committee (who handle the more secret matters in the name of the duchy), one of the diet, took his own life with a dagger at night in bed, was lying alone in a chamber, with his left breast lying with hands so closed together, when they were separated, they fell back together. He was later put in a barrel, thrown into the Isar, but did not want to flow from there as they did to him, finally buried the barrel in a gravel pit. This is how it happened.</p>
      <p>Gracious lord Bullinger, my friendly request, your honor will not take this my letter, written in haste, in bad part, but understand it in a trusting manner, to greet your faithful co-worker in the gospel friendly in the Lord, in whose grace I commend your honor along with myself, awaiting an answer.</p>
      <p>Given in Landshut in haste on the last of January in the year 50. Anthoni Simburger, princely grace advocate and court procurator there, your honor's willing.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and highly learned Heinrich Bullinger, church servant in Zurich, my especially trusted lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Anthoni Sibenb√ºrger, procurator at the court in Bavaria.</p>
