    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommends once again [Martin?] Rischacher, who resumed his studies after having to give up the tailoring trade, which his father had urged him into, due to his eyes. Swiss [mercenaries] are passing through Alsace, although Emperor [Charles V] and [King Francis I] have not yet made peace; a certain nobleman is very distressed that the Emperor has not yet become King of France.</p>

      <p>Greetings. This is the young man I recently recommended to you, the son, I mean, of Alexander von Rischach. From the beginning, he devoted himself to his studies; the expenses, which were burdensome for his father, compelled him to learn the tailoring trade. After he had learned this well, he went to Strasbourg to work. However, after some time there, his eyes could not endure the work in the light; for, like his father, he has weak eyes, and for this reason, he returned to his studies, which he would never have left if he had not been forced to follow his father's advice. I ask you, as much as it is in your power, to have the young man recommended. I have told Mr. von Rischach with what spirit you have served him in this matter; he was and still is grateful to you, hoping that you will understand someday how much he values you and your favor.</p>
      <p>The Swiss Confederates are passing through Alsace, which is surprising since I have not heard that peace has been made between the Emperor and the French King. There is a nobleman near Basel who is excessively troubled by melancholy because the Emperor has not become King of France before the birth of the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell through Christ with your family.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, before dawn, December 4, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable lord in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
