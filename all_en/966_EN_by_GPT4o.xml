      <p>Strasbourg, July 10, 1550.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Not long ago, I wrote to your kindness, dearest Bullinger, and along with my letter, I enclosed many others received from England and Hooper. I sent them to Valentin Nußbaum in Basel, so that they might be delivered to you more safely through him; for here, a courier is rarely found except at the fairs. In my letters, I wrote that our Hooper was elected to the office of bishop by the king and the senate of England, which is confirmed to be certain. I pray to God that he may preside well over this office. Our Strasbourg, as the rumor goes, is in turmoil; for three churches are granted to the papists, in which they freely practice their errors.</p>
      <p>The people are divided among themselves: some praise papism; however, the greater part opposes it. Some old men and matrons, contrary to everyone's opinion, adhere to the truth; religion remains free, as do the preachers. Many doubt what monstrosity the Council of Augsburg may foster. In England, all is calm; religion is making progress.</p>
      <p>There is no rumor here that the Emperor will attack you, nor do I predict it arising from anywhere else among you than from the opinion of soldiers, who each measure the Emperor by their own judgment. Rather, I am convinced that he will wage war on the cities.</p>
      <p>If I hear anything unfavorable about your Switzerland, I will not remain silent. In the meantime, we must pray to God to grant peace. Farewell, most esteemed friend. My family sends their regards to you and yours.</p>
      <p>Your Burcher.</p>
      <p>Through Falkner, I sent a large bundle of letters addressed to Mr. Pellican, whom I ask you to greet in my name. Your books and letters were brought to England long ago. I also received letters from Mr. Theodor, which I immediately sent by courier, whom I ask you to commend me to and to tell these things. Farewell again. The bustle of the fairs does not allow me to linger any longer. Strasbourg, July 10.</p>
      <p>Mr. Gwalter wrote to me about the painted panels prepared for Mr. Hales. I have never heard anything from him about them; however, I will write and, if he orders, I will pay the money. Seventeen days ago, I sent a package from Hooper to you and a basket from Hales to Mr. Gwalter; I hope you have received them.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my kind lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
