      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ, our Savior.</p>
      <p>Gracious, dear lord and brother, since you sent me your sermon on the Lord's Supper, for which I thank you most kindly, I have not received any letter from you. Now, Christian loyalty, which I rightly show to the present Hans König and his wife, compels me to inform you of his situation. I brought him to Leingen five years ago; he is a very good-hearted, pious, faithful Christian, although poorly spoken, but well-versed in writing and arithmetic, has taught German school and led a very good life, as his departure and my recommendation show. The new papists or Lutherans have inquired against him, and as soon as he did not want to confess the bodily or material presence of Christ in bread and wine, he was forbidden to hold school. That is the only reason for his departure; although it was not mentioned in the farewell, if you could help and advise him to be allowed to hold school again, spare no effort. You know well who the rewarder is.</p>
      <p>The enclosed adverse doctrine of the Lutherans he has copied by hand. In my opinion, it would be good if it came to print with an improvement of the preface: but if you do not want to have it printed, my request is to have it returned to me. You cannot believe what nonsense is in the new papists; what they condemned in the old papacy, they now call good again. I fight fiercely and in such a way against them that they have aroused much displeasure with my most gracious lord.</p>
      <p>I have committed myself and engaged in the purchase of the lying goods so far that I now dare not endure any change for many years; otherwise, I would not stay. Well, it must be fought and won.</p>
      <p>If I knew where to find Dr. Matthias Gribaldus, I would take a ride for your and his sake. You may trust me well, wherever he may be found.</p>
      <p>The imperial majesty Ferdinand is already in Augsburg, but otherwise little standing. I do not know what kind of court day it will be.</p>
      <p>I think to myself, a Turkish aid will be the end of it; nothing substantial or princely do I know to hope for. I long to know how it stands with Mr. Peter Martyr, Mr. Francesco Ochino, and all dear lords and friends. Greet everyone who knows me.</p>
      <p>Finally, up to 1200 hexameter verses have come to me, in which the new papacy is very artfully depicted. Hoping that they might be printed, I will send them to you.</p>
      <p>It would indeed be a necessity.</p>
      <p>Let me know with a reply.</p>
      <p>The verses are good and artistic, the material or invention is truthful. Given in haste on the 14th of January, in the year 1558.</p>
      <p>Georg Frölich von der Lemnitz at Schlachteck. To the venerable and highly learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, the church leader of Zurich, my especially gracious, dear lord, to hand.</p>
