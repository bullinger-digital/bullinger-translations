      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of Christ in Zürich, a learned and pious man, Johannes Travers the Elder of Chur sends greetings.</p>
      <p>It seems like an age has passed, most dear Bullinger, since we last exchanged letters. I have no doubt that this was intercepted under the pretext of an intrinsic love of forgetfulness. Indeed, you have confessed in almost all your letters to the brothers in Chur that you have preserved the memory of your Travers; I, for my part, by the immortal gods, have never let you out of the prison of my heart, although prevented by inertia or distance, I have not sharpened my pen. If it has been omitted for a period of time, I will make up for it by writing more frequently. Meanwhile, dearest brother, interpret my silence kindly.</p>
      <p>I received the little work of Johannes Calvin on Superstitions, offered to me in your name, and read it with eagerness, not without benefit. I was reported to you by some brothers as still being involved in some superstitions with good zeal, especially because I lingered in the temple after the sermon was made, while the papal mass was being finished. The truth was revealed to you, that I had long since abolished that mass with all its ceremonies. The reading of that little work and the correction of the brothers with me brought about that a year ago I completely ceased to participate in the abuse of the mass, and thus I will continue to persevere. Moreover, I heard that you were unwell for some time. I sympathized with your pains; but when I heard from the brothers that you had recovered your former health, I rejoiced, and may the gods keep you safe with us for a long time in that state. There is nothing new with us worth writing about. Italy is afflicted with its usual disease, with warlike tumults in the imperial camps. Common matters are more harmful to you than I can declare further. Farewell, my Bullinger, and keep Travers in your register, I pray. Chur, 12 days before the Kalends of August 1553.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of Christ in Zürich, a [learned and] pious man, my friend and brother... most beloved above all.</p>
