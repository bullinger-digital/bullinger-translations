    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has received Myconius' letter No. 270 and is pleased with his love for him and the church. Bullinger and Jud had to answer to the council for their criticism of Zürich's alliance with the Five Cantons and the general drunkenness, but they were acquitted and confirmed in their preaching office. The situation is dangerous: while the Catholics persecute the Reformers, the other Reformers only think of their own interests. The Five Cantons are greedy for money and also divided among themselves. They do not want to heed the warning of the Zürichers, who caution them against an alliance with foreign rulers. The Zürichers abhor foreign gold; the strict laws against the pension system remain in force. Many want an alliance with France against the Pope. Karlstadt complied with Myconius' request, and Bullinger is confident in the matter.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I received your letter full of love and I cannot express how much joy it brought me, seeing your sincere affection towards me growing more and more each day, and your remarkable care for the churches continually increasing.</p>
      <p>We are indeed vigilant, as you advise, as much as we can and as much as the Lord has granted us grace, so much so that in these days some impious people have summoned us to court because Leo and I have somewhat harshly accused that fellowship with the Five Cantons of drunkenness and debauchery. But the council disapproved of the attempts of the impious, and even suppressed them, although not as much as was otherwise deserved, and ordered us to continue freely in the administration of the word and in the accusation of crimes. Our adversaries were Liechti, Krieg, Beltzinger, Boßhart, Füßly, Boledt, Holtzhalb, etc. We indeed see that some kind of destruction is hanging over us all, indeed I believe a calamitous disaster is closer than anyone believes. We receive the word of the Lord coldly. The adversaries pursue too ardently, and we diligently watch over our own interests, neglecting charity. The adversaries sell the fatherland for gold, pluck the princes with their arts, serve pleasures, and so sins are committed on both sides, so that I believe soon all will perish together, although in the meantime I do not doubt the just God will rescue his own from temptation. The Five Cantons live so impiously that I do not know if a more profligate way of living can be found. They are so at odds with each other and are tumultuous with factions bought with gold, that I believe vengeance stands at the door. They disdain the warnings of our people. For our people warn them to abstain from alliances and to shake off the ambitions of princes from their necks. But all in vain. However, although many despair of us, I do not despair. Although their gold is dear, yet most of our people abhor it, and it remains a capital crime to have accepted anything or to have followed the stipends of princes. We will also strive with all our might to resist the efforts of those who would have us ally with the king against the Pope. For today I see nothing reigning among all but imposture, corruption, avarice, iniquity.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell and always pray to the Lord to assist his church.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 18th October 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich.</p>
      <p>What you entrusted to Karlstadt, he has explained. However, I do not fear danger in that part. But if this matter is to be decided entirely by the throw of Mars' dice or by chance, I would not want to begin otherwise. But I hope nothing of the sort will happen. In the meantime, I have entrusted this matter, whatever it is, to some faithful ones, etc.</p>
      <p>To Lord Oswald Myconius, the most vigilant bishop of the church of Basel, his dearest brother in the Lord.</p>
