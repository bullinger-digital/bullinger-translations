    <p xml:id="regest1">On November 14, someone came from Milan and reported that [the Governor Alfonso d'Avalos] had treated the Swiss delegation decently. They were even invited by him to the [Milanese] castle. However, some envoys were not willing to do so, which was wise, as they could later have been accused of spying given the tense situation. What the [Marquis] replied, no one [currently] knows. - The news of unrest in Valais has reached [St. Gallen]. Should Bullinger know anything for certain, he should share it. There are people who highly credit the [Catholic] places for asserting their religion and having expelled the [Protestants] from there. Others praise the [Protestants] for their steadfastness against foreign deceit. And certainly, the [Protestant religion] is worth the effort!</p>

      <p>We have here in St. Gallen received news from someone (who came from Milan on November 14) that the Marquis de la Quasta treated the Swiss delegation very honorably and accommodated them, and even invited them to the castle. Some envoys were not willing to do so. In my opinion, this was handled wisely; because whatever might later occur in such dangerous times, one might have thought that something had been inspected or spied upon by them. However, what his response is, no one knows, etc.</p>
      <p>The unrest and commotion in Valais have been reported here by some unknown sources. If you have any certain information, I beg you to let me know. There are those who highly credit the Catholic places for asserting their religion and having expelled our religion (Protestantism) from there. Others praise our people for their steadfastness, for neither yielding nor lending an ear to foreign deceit. This is the reason why we are certainly fatigued.</p>
      <p>Farewell. St. Gallen, November 19, in the year of our salvation. I. Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his [in] Zurich.</p>
