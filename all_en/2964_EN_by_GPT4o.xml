      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ the Savior, etc.</p>
      <p>Our traveler from Assula, although he was about to depart, having obtained a sufficiently honorable dismissal and testimony of a life well-lived from our school authorities, wished to be commended to your kindness through us. Certainly, if he had wished to stay with us longer, our school would have gladly used his services; but since he considers that his affairs cannot be otherwise managed unless he returns there, it was not our place to hinder him, though we would have preferred him to be promoted. As far as we know, he has lived quite honorably with his family, and he was diligent in the literary school. We have occasionally attended his sermons, which he handled quite skillfully for the grace of God, and we do not doubt that if any church is entrusted to him, he will fulfill his duties satisfactorily.</p>
      <p>We therefore most earnestly ask that you hold him in commendation, so that he may understand that our recommendation was not ordinary.</p>
      <p>We give thanks for the provisions granted, hoping they will be of great benefit to our youth. My fellow ministers greet you. I wish all of you well. Hastily from Schaffhausen, July 11, in the year of human salvation 1556. Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished servant of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zürich, his esteemed lord and dearest brother. Zürich.</p>
