    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] If Serin were not aware of his own insignificance and the great workload that Bullinger has to manage, Bullinger's long silence would trouble him. Nevertheless, he wonders if he might have done something wrong, since Bullinger (who was the first to initiate their correspondence) suddenly stopped writing, or if those who handed him Bullinger's letter addressed to him [from September 4, 1546 (HBBW XVII, No. 2565)] already unsealed might not be well-disposed towards him and are slandering him. What particularly leads Serin to the latter question is the fact that Bullinger promised him a correspondence with Johannes Haller in that unsealed letter, but he has not received a letter from him, just as the latter has not received one from him. However, these are only conjectures, as love must not be suspicious.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] With the present letter, Serin mainly wants to prevent Bullinger from believing that he has changed his view on the Lord's Supper and now adheres to the regulations on the Lord's Supper contained in the new Ulm "Handbook," should Bullinger happen to see it (which was published without the knowledge of the Ulm council and - just like in the case of the Ulm Catechism - does not agree in all points with the first versions).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Serin also wants to know whether the people of Zurich would tolerate the Lutheran, almost semi-papist custom of administering the Lord's Supper to the dying at home without a particularly weighty reason. To avoid appearing presumptuous and making false claims, he does not dare to present the proponents of this custom with the practices of the Reformed churches in Helvetia and their neighbors (such as Kempten or Augsburg). From Bullinger, who is already sufficiently occupied with more important matters, he does not demand a detailed treatise on this, but only a brief answer.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger is greeted and may continue to think of Serin, even if he does not write. May the Lord thwart the plans of the enemies, guide the people of Zurich, and protect them from all evil.</p>

      <p>S. P. in domino. It would indeed be difficult for me, dear Bullinger, to bear your long silence with equanimity, if not for the just consideration of my own insignificance and your many affairs, which quells my indignation. Yet, a thought and suspicion still creeps upon me: "What have you done wrong, that he has so suddenly ceased from the duty of writing (which you certainly would never have dared to demand, but he himself voluntarily undertook)? What if those who handed over his letters to you, already unsealed, have slandered you to others? What kind of loyalty do they hold towards you and him?" And this latter thought was also prompted by the fact that in those unsealed letters, you gave me hope of a correspondence with Haller, from whom I have never received anything, just as he has received nothing from me. But let there be a limit to suspicion, lest charity be harmed.</p>

      <p>Rather, I will take care that you are not moved by the new handbooks, containing the order of sacramental administration, etc., published this year under the name of the Ulm magistrate (who was indeed asleep, yet dreaming nothing of the sort - that is, unaware of it), to believe that I have renounced my confession concerning the sacraments (if any have ever come into your hands that were not entirely in conformity with the primary ones, but have undergone such a metamorphosis as has often been detected in the publication of the Ulm catechisms), or to think that I either use or accommodate them.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The other reason for this letter of mine is that I inquire whether it is considered tolerable among you to perform the sacred mystery of the supper privately with the bedridden, even for a few days, according to the Lutheran and thus semi-papist custom, without any special and exceptional reason beyond the common one. For I do not dare to oppose the judgment and custom of the reformed churches of Helvetia and their neighbors, such as Kempten, Augsburg, etc., to those who allege them, lest I assert anything rashly. To this, if you respond even briefly at some time, you will have helped me in my struggle. I do not demand a more exact disputation, lest I be troublesome and unjustly interrupt you, who are intent on more serious matters.</p>

      <p>Farewell, remember me, even if you write nothing. May the Lord change all the plans of your enemies, guide yours, and preserve you from all evils! Farewell again. Ulm, August 4, 1547. Leonhard Serin.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. H. Bullinger, bishop of the church of Zurich, who has deserved the best from all candidates of theology, a brother in the Lord much beloved and to be respected. Zurich.</p>
