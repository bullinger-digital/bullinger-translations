      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, honorable lord and godfather, along with your most useful and certainly very learned little book, for which I rightfully give you great thanks and pray to the Lord that He may extend your strength for many more years, so that you may continually assist the struggling Church of Christ with your labors. With us, things are as follows: Yesterday and today, that is, the 23rd and 24th of this month, each minister of the Lausanne class was examined before the full senate (although today not all could be completed, and therefore a few were postponed to tomorrow). First, the natives, eight in number, separated themselves from the others, who are all French, and agreed to the present reformation, until more can be obtained with the edification and goodwill of the magistrate. After them, the minister of Aigle, who above others stirred this matter, with two others, refused to consent and chose exile instead, which was also decreed for them. The rest, seeing where things were heading, began to respond more mildly.</p>
      <p>Thus, none of them were ordered to exile today.</p>
      <p>Only two requested time to respond until tomorrow. This was granted to them.</p>
      <p>I therefore hope there will be few who wish to go into exile with the others. The senate dealt with them very kindly, so much so that they themselves marvel at such gentleness in such a matter. It also dismissed all those unwilling to stay with an honorable allowance.</p>
      <p>It also promised and granted them more than ever before. Thus, contrary to our expectations, many depart very happily.</p>
      <p>Nor are there lacking those who sincerely rejoice at being relieved of those leaders, whom they confess to have followed more for their authority than for their reasons.</p>
      <p>We therefore hope for more peaceful times henceforth, and the senate will also learn to address offenses with greater care in the future than hitherto, so as not to be forced to endure more serious disturbances than now. This examination, I say, will benefit both the ministers and our senate, for matters pertaining to church discipline and edification were diligently examined on both sides. I cannot yet write anything certain about the professors.</p>
      <p>For so far, only the ministers have been dealt with.</p>
      <p>Perhaps some of them will depart.</p>
      <p>But with the good grace of the senate.</p>
      <p>You will learn what happens next shortly.</p>
      <p>I cannot say more now.</p>
      <p>We have nothing from France.</p>
      <p>What is said about peace is not yet certain.</p>
      <p>For your Polish letters, I give you great thanks; I sent them back these days to my brother. We wonder what is happening in England; you will have something from the Frankfurt fairs, which we pray you to share with us, and at the same time to frequently pray to the Lord for us and our churches. May all yours be safe.</p>
      <p>Our people, especially Mr. Musculus, my father-in-law, and my mother, greet you.</p>
      <p>In Bern, February 24, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
