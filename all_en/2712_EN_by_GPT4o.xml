      <p>Greetings. There will be no need to remind me of our old friendship; for I have neither begun to forget it nor will I ever forget it, and for this reason, I wish to show my gratitude to you and yours on any occasion. Therefore, as soon as I understood from your letters what you have decided regarding your sons, I summoned both of them to me and earnestly encouraged the one who is departing, out of my love for you, first to conduct himself among the Saxons in such a way that he may not bring disgrace to you or our country, and then I indicated what had benefited me when I was once in Wittenberg and from which things one should especially abstain; to the other, I offered my assistance whenever he desires it, although I hope he will lack nothing whether you consider the means of living or his studies.</p>
      <p>For to learn the arts for which he was sent, he will have suitable teachers, and at Burcher's, life is such that an abundance of food rather than a lack of it might hinder a student. Added to this is the discipline of our school and the studies of his fellow students, by which he will surely be easily provoked to make greater progress in literature; for both those whom you have sent and many others diligently and not without praise apply themselves to good literature and liberal learning with us.</p>
      <p>I hope your son will not so much marvel at their example as imitate it; however, if he needs encouragement or requires my help and advice, I will be his advisor and will not allow him to lack anything. Farewell. Greet on my behalf Mr. Pellican and the others who are fond of me. In Strasbourg, the day after the calends of September in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Petrus Dasypodius, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, churchman among the people of ZÃ¼rich, his friend.</p>
