      <p>Honorable, especially beloved, dear lord and trusted friend, I send you my greetings and service beforehand, and hereby inform you that I have recently received your letter concerning the boy Wipf, and I thank you most sincerely for your kindness towards my dear son. I also kindly ask you to continue to support him in this and other matters, as he is in need of it. However, I hope that he will conduct himself in such a way that he will be able to repay and earn whatever good comes to him.</p>
      <p>As for what happens through me and in need, I sincerely pray to God that He will repay it. With a friendly request, if you have any further messages to France, through which I could write to my son, please inform me of this through the boy Wipf. I hereby commend you to the protection of God; may He truly protect and break all evil plots.</p>
      <p>In haste from Uster, the last day of June, your faithful and good friend Ulrich Philipp von Hohensax, Freiherr, 1572. I sincerely thank the lord's daughter.</p>
      <p>To my beloved lord and trusted friend, Master Heinrich Bullinger, of the Church of Zurich.</p>
