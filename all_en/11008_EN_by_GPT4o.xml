      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have presented the letters of your most illustrious council to Mayor Röist for reading, and they were pleasing. There is no need for you to fear that anyone from Zurich will undertake anything further in this matter, now that we understand your opinion. For you must be persuaded of this, that we truly wish you well, and that what we have done in this matter, we have done with the intention of helping; therefore, understanding how little we would benefit you if we attempted anything further, we are entirely yours and cease to press the matter. Continue to be ours. Be steadfast, and may the Lord be with you always.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 10.</p>
      <p>Röist, Theodor, Leo, and the others greet you. Greet your family and the people of Constance. 1537.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Thomas Blarer, Mayor of Constance, my most esteemed lord.</p>
