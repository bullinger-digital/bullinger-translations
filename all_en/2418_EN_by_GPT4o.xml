      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, may you be well. I arrived in Straßburg the day before yesterday, as I had written I would do, and I have already begun to do something, though I know not what. I think I will stay here for one month, then go to Basel, then come to you, and then home. You will know what compels me to undertake these burdens now, and you will gladly hear that Molineus came here with me, whom I have never deserted; but who could support someone living like that? He says he wants to live in Montbéliard; the rest about him I will tell you in person. I have not yet seen your son, but I will see him soon and often; I wish I could help him in some way.</p>
      <p>Greet my fellow English exiles for me. What I wrote about the 200 florins, which the most illustrious prince has destined for them, is very true; he himself said it with his own mouth, and I am diligently ensuring that they are sent and that account is taken of those who are with you; affirm this to them. I wrote to a certain poor brother, who is in Clavenna; but from Istria, to come to me; he will travel through Zürich.</p>
      <p>I beg you, lend me two books from those heretics you sent out, and he will bring them to me, that is, the Pontifical and those Italian verses of Giovanni della Casa. I will faithfully bring both back to you myself. I cannot restrain myself from writing now: The history of Sleidan has begun to be printed from the year 1517; I am indeed present to help as much as I can with my small ability. We will have a good book, and not very pleasing to the Antiochians and antichrists. I bid everyone farewell. Pray for me, all of you. Straßburg, October 6, 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>[Before 630]: To you, Mr. Bullinger.</p>
