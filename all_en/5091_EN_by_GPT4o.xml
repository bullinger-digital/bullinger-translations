      <p>Most illustrious man, most esteemed lord and brother, greetings. I have written back to Mr. Johann Wolff, from whom you will know what both of us think you should know. I am now writing to most diligently commend to you the sons of the noble and pious man, Lord Stanislaus Czikowski, who has greatly served the church of God. I also earnestly request you to ensure that the attached letters are delivered to Mr. Calvin. I am sending you a copy of your letters, in which you respond to some unknown letters sent to you by Mr. Martin Czechowius, the messenger of the illustrious Palatine of Vilnius, as if they were written in the name of the churches of Lesser Poland. When the reverend Mr. Felix left Kraków, he entrusted this province to me. I see that you, a man otherwise very prudent, and Mr. Calvin have been deceived by someone who usurps the title of pastor of the Kraków church, to more easily deceive. This person, having persuaded a certain minister, a man of ambitious and turbulent nature, and having misled Mr. Felix Cruciger, the superintendent, otherwise a man of great integrity, wrote letters to you in the name of the churches of Lesser Poland and included a certain confession. However, do not trust such letters anymore; a synod of elders held in Kraków on the 10th of this month makes you and Mr. Calvin aware through letters signed by the superintendents of the churches and several senior members of the equestrian order. As for your greetings to me in your letters to Mr. Felix, I am grateful, but as for your exhortation to be upright, there would be grounds for me to argue with you familiarly, if I did not love you more than you trust me. But more on this another time.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious man, and know that your Lismaninus can err, but cannot and will not be a heretic. I respectfully greet all your household and colleagues through you.</p>
      <p>Kraków, December 14, 1561.</p>
      <p>Francesco Lismanini, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, most esteemed lord and brother. Zürich, otherwise known as Zurich.</p>
