      <p>I received your most beautiful and pious exhortation along with the letters written to me and Jewel on March 23. I retained Jewel's letters (because he had previously passed away) with me.</p>
      <p>The Queen of Scots still remains with us. At the previous parliament, she feared greatly for herself, and not without reason; for if it had not been for the great clemency of our queen, it would have been over for her. What will happen to her at the next parliament, I am still uncertain. Certainly, she has very few friends among us, and what wonder, when she covets our kingdom and is stained and almost covered with so many and such great crimes?</p>
      <p>With three contentious preachers excluded from here, great peace and concord prevail in the Belgic-German church. Your response to the Bavarian articles has been translated into the English language and is in everyone's hands. I received other letters from you on December 10, in which you write about the great tumult stirred up in Rhaetia.</p>
      <p>The Pope maintains his old ways, being the author of this and all other crimes; but it is well that it has again been quelled by the death of the most papistic rascal, who tried to bring back papism. On the first of April, our most celebrated parliament will begin. For these eight weeks, frost and snow have continued, and very rarely during this whole time have they ceased; but now they have vanished. Praise be to God, the best and greatest!</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest Bullinger. Greet in my name all yours and all my friends in Zürich. My wife, now suffering from gout, greets you and all of you.</p>
      <p>In haste, at Ludham, January 20, 1573.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, John Parkhurst, Bishop of Norwich.</p>
      <p>Here in England, the Bishop of Norwich.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
