      <p>God be with us, dearly beloved son, what Froschauer wrote from Frankfurt on September 18, new news along with a beautiful epitaph of the admiral of blessed memory and in the city of Paris, I gave to Heinrich yesterday to give to you in autumn, so that he sends it to you; if he didn't do it yesterday, he will do it now. I have not received anything from Siderhar: The talk is strong, the king desires 6000 Swiss: For what purpose? To cut off the remnants or to help the Duke of Alba or to help fight England. They will make themselves participants in innocent blood, as many as will give themselves to this military service. It is said by some that they would rather execute us and us as well as those slaughtered in France. Some say: "What if, when they arm themselves, as if they are going to France, and then unexpectedly fall upon us?" and many strange talks. Thus, there are people among us who trust the world well and do not believe quickly as before our war. There are also those who are worried, etc. God is to be earnestly prayed to, that He may have mercy on us and protect us fatherly as He has so far. Unless the Lord guards the city, the watchman stays awake in vain, etc. Herewith I send you and Susanna two French thickens in gratitude, that you sent me 2 partridges, birds, a hare, half a kid, and half a piglet; have it for good, and thank God sincerely. I have had as guests Mayor Brämen, Treasurer Aescher, brother-in-law and scribe, J. Hansen Wysen and their wives and the old Mrs. Meysin and Mrs. von Cham. Herewith you and Susanna and the children are commended to God.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, Saturday, September 27, 1572. All my people greet you. Greet J. Hansen Peyer, H. Hansen Löwen, etc., for me.</p>
      <p>The day in Aarau went well and unanimously, etc., praise God.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
