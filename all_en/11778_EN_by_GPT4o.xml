    <p xml:id="regest1">He only learned late about the departure of the messenger and is generally exhausted; therefore, he writes only with difficulty. He gratefully returns Martin Frecht's letter, thanks for the trust, and also assures him of a confidential exchange of information; he would like to comment more on Frecht's letter. He cannot return the writing [“Confutation and refutation of the queen Marie's envoy on the Duke of Cleves' supposed defense...”] yet, as [Mayor Johannes] Haab is currently reading it; [Diethelm] Röist is suffering from a fever, Blarer should pray for him. He likes the writing [“Short index... on Mr. Caspar Schwenckfeld's booklet...”] by [Sebastian] Coccyus, although C[aspar] S[chwenckfeld] will certainly mock some of the imprudent statements contained therein; more on the matter when Bullinger has more time. The letter carrier, a son-in-law of [Werner] Steiner, is traveling via Ulm to Nuremberg; Blarer and Frecht should recommend him to [Andreas] Osiander and others. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>The messenger hurried, my esteemed Ambrosius, and I was informed of the departure too late. I am also very exhausted from the many and lengthy sermons I have delivered to the church these days, as I am not endowed with a robust and strong health, and I could hardly write this. Therefore, I beg your kindness to consider these words, however they may be, favorably.</p>
      <p>I am returning the letter of our dearest friend Martin Frecht and express my greatest thanks for your affection, which I see is absolutely perfect towards me in every respect, not only because you write so frequently and familiarly, but because you share everything with me. Therefore, believe me, I will have nothing so secret that I will not share it with your affection, if you either ask or I otherwise think it will be in your interest, so that you are not unaware. I will also ensure that I am most discreet with secrets and will not carelessly disclose anything that could be harmful to you or your friends. I would write about certain points of his letter if time and the brevity of the moment permitted.</p>
      <p>I could not send the booklet published for Queen Maria against the Duke of Jülich about that unfortunate Brabant and Jülich war at present; for Mayor Haab is currently reading it. The most holy and prudent man, Röist, is afflicted with a fever. Please pray to the Lord that he may quickly restore the heart of our city to us.</p>
      <p>I read Coccyus's booklet, and I liked the diction and argumentation of the learned and pious man, although some words were placed somewhat indiscreetly, which Caspar Schwenckfeld, a slippery, talkative man born to slander, will undoubtedly mock. They do not offend me nor will they offend any good man; but he is truly not a good man; therefore, he will slander. I will write about these matters in other letters, if time and opportunity allow.</p>
      <p>The one who brings this to you is heading to Nuremberg via Ulm. He has a matter which he will explain to you himself. I therefore beg you, for the sake of our love and friendship, to recommend him to Frecht, whom you will also greet on my behalf, and that both Frecht and you recommend him to Osiander, so that he may assist with his cause. He is the son-in-law of Steiner. If you have other friends in Nuremberg whom you think should be informed, I beg you to extend yourself to me in this matter.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours. Please pray to God for me and our church. On Easter day, 5 in the afternoon, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Ambrosius Blarer, his incomparable friend and brother in all things.</p>
