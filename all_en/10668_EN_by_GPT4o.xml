      <p>May the grace of God the Father always be with us all, etc.</p>
      <p>Dearest father and patron of all mortals, indeed, kindly forgive the delay in this writing due to the unequal status of the writer and the recipient, but consider more carefully the mind and heartfelt desires; this will be the only time for now.</p>
      <p>On the 18th of August, due to a pressing reason (yet with all honor intact), I visited the baths in Winterthur, where lamentations (which nonetheless occur not without the will of the Most High) about the sorrow of the people of Zurich and the impending plague were being expressed. Immediately, I remembered you and your dear family, fearing contamination. Through the mercy of Almighty God, I earnestly pray from the bottom of my heart (since perhaps you may not be able to leave), that if at least you could send your family, beloved parents and wife, as well as your children, away from the undoubtedly deadly air and that hereditary disease, you would entrust them to me in the village of Veltheim, where (to the glory of the Almighty) all is safe. To them, along with my most beloved wife (who, more precisely than I, has not forgotten your bestowed kindness and asks), I will provide and dedicate all my resources, so that you need not worry about food, drink, or nightly rest, as I will arrange everything abundantly. And if you are to assist me, respond without delay and without any hesitation, and as soon as I see your hand, my wife and I will rise with eager and joyful spirits to go to Zurich, and no less safely than the angels led Lot himself, we will bring your entire family. This I say for the salvation of my soul, without deceit and pretense, but with sincere love towards his dear Heinrich, ready for greater things if it were within my rights. May He, who is the giver of all good things, reward you and may the bestowed gifts overflow. Blessed be His name forever. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given in Veltheim, on the 19th of August.</p>
      <p>Yours most ready to fulfill your wishes, Johannes Lang, unworthy pastor of Veltheim.</p>
      <p>To the most devoted man of piety, Master Heinrich Bullinger, bishop in Zurich, most vigilant friend and dearest brother.</p>
