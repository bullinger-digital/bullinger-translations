      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ the Savior, etc.</p>
      <p>When the most honorable brothers Farel and Théodore de Bèze were passing through, Bullinger, brother in Christ to be revered, among other things, they mentioned the concord, which we can easily reconcile with the Lutherans without compromising the truth, or at least soothe the exasperated minds of the parties, provided that we do not fail or cease in such a necessary and beneficial matter. This matter has greatly refreshed us, especially since we understand that Duke Christoph will not be lacking in counsel and authority, and that the most prominent of our opponents desire this uniquely. I do not doubt that you have understood all these things more fully from them. Therefore, it did not seem worthwhile to discuss this matter at length. However, we ask you to apply all your efforts to this, so that through the most ample council of Zürich, the other churches of the Swiss may be urged to send a delegation to the princes to inquire about this from them. As much as is in us, we will not fail in our duty and we hope that our council will agree to this. Furthermore, although it is not my place to thrust my sickle into another's harvest, there is something I would like to ask you in my name; for the singular love with which I embrace Burchard Leemann impels me to do so, since I hear that the pastor of Laufen will be removed from there due to that miserable disease with which the Lord afflicts him, and another will be appointed in his place. If by any means it can be done, I would like you to ensure that our Burckard is promoted to that position. I sincerely desire to have the man as a neighbor, both because of the pleasantness of his character and his singular learning. He has preached several times in some of our churches at our urging. We have heard him preach, and we could not sufficiently admire the eloquence, arrangement, zeal, and learning of the man. I know that you will easily interpret my boldness in a better light due to your humanity towards all, and if anything has been done wrong in this matter, you will attribute it to my singular love for the man. If I err, love also knows how to err; for it is blind. Nor will I be able to either compel or hinder you by my prejudice from deliberating on what seems best to you. My fellow ministers greet you. Give my many greetings to D. Theodor, Gualther, and Wolf. Meanwhile, farewell, long safe in our church.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, 22nd of May, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the singularly pious and learned Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, lord and brother to be uniquely honored.</p>
