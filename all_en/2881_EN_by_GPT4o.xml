      <p>S. P. Your previous letter of kindness, dated the sixth of October, was delivered to my wife in my absence, along with a silver shekel, and I received them only after returning home almost a full month later. This is the reason why I have been slow to respond to them until now. I express my utmost gratitude to your excellence for the transmitted shekel, which you, when I requested a lead one, chose to give in silver, thereby binding me to you completely with your generosity and munificence. However, I wish (since you have long received the list of my coins) to understand from you whether there are any among mine that your kindness would desire; indeed, I would ensure that they are formed and returned to you from mine as you wish. At present, to declare myself grateful in some way, I send to your excellence a Nicophorus formed from a golden archetype, a coin not of ancient Roman antiquity, but Constantinopolitan, struck by a Christian emperor. In the inscription on the other side, where two images are seen, I cannot, after these letters [Greek], gather the rest to have any meaning. If your kindness can make sense of them, I ask you to communicate it to me at your leisure.</p>
      <p>I also thank you for the booklet, namely the Summa of true religion, presented to me in your name by Mr. Froschauer; I did not receive the other from the Gesner brothers. However, I wish to reciprocate and serve your kindness in any way I can and ask that you do not doubt my benevolent mind towards you and keep me in your commendation. Farewell, most distinguished and esteemed man.</p>
      <p>Given at Frankfurt on the calends of April in the year etc. 56.</p>
      <p>... to the most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger etc., a lord and friend to be especially honored. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
