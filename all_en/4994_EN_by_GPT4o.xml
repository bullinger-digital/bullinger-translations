      <p>S. Your reverence desires to know from me, firstly, what the communities are inclined to do in this recent matter, and if a response has been given, what kind it is. To this, I give the following answer: that we, with the majority of the communities, assure all good things, some of whom have also sent their council envoys to Chur for the synod held on the 24th of September, have departed with friendly offers to assist and advise us in these matters. Therefore, they have also sat down with us and made a council decision, which we, hoping in God, will be very fruitful and successful. In the courts, there will be no need; they are ours.</p>
      <p>In the church, the bishop is conducting a difficult practice; but it shall not succeed, if God wills. The Upper League has many instigations from those who know well.</p>
      <p>There will still be much talk about it, and so much that it will soon become too difficult for some; for the communities in the Upper League are very restless. Many strange talks are circulating among the common people, not necessary to mention here.</p>
      <p>However, it is impossible to know the community's command now; for each envoy first reveals and opens it when gathered in the common council. There has also been no community meeting about it yet; it is not yet time.</p>
      <p>The world has been too burdened with affairs in all work so far. So much for now.</p>
      <p>Secondly, whether those envoys will also appear at the league day is still uncertain; yet, according to my lord mayor, they are entirely waiting for them, and in his opinion, they will not fail to come; but I cannot yet indicate anything definite at this time. From your reverence's writing, however, I can well sense where these questions are ultimately leading; for it appears from the worldly wise where the matter might be settled among us, if it were delayed and stood still, whereas we see much differently. The more courageous the response of the lands will be, the better we need the city envoys to deter the foreigners, so that they do not undertake anything against us with force in the future. So much for this.</p>
      <p>I can well recognize that everything is very expensive with you. However, you should have more compassion with us; for what one buys from you for a penny, costs us gladly 3. If I wanted to complain, I would have much to complain about; it would not be unnecessary for me either; but I remain silent and endure everything for the sake of God and His church, to avoid offense and scandal. Besides all this, we rarely come out among strangers.</p>
      <p>So I say by my faith, that I sold a good part of my household goods in Zürich, used the money for the journey; but since then, I have not been able to replace those pieces. This reminds me that I am a pilgrim here and should not rely on rags and tatters. Although my wife has lamented much about it, she has also learned to bear the cross patiently, so that she now endures it far better. Thus, God can lead us to school, and therefore, even if it is expensive with you and one has full hands to do, one must nevertheless advise and help unceasingly.</p>
      <p>So far, grain has come over the Lake of Como from the Milanese territory; with it, the Valtellina and the entire Upper League, along with others beyond the mountains, are managing. If now the envoys are given a negative response, it stands that the grain is withheld in the Duchy of Milan; then there will be anxiety and need; for our merchants have not offered you any special surplus at the markets in Zürich for a while. As for recent news, we have nothing now, except that we hear from Lindau about the Constance matter and furthermore, that the greater part of the chapter is to be held on the side of the Freiburgers, to whom the Duke of Württemberg is also not supposed to bear ill will. Nothing further, except that Almighty God may keep your reverence along with yours in long-lasting, constant health. Amen. Given in Chur on Michaelmas, in the year of our Lord 1561. Your reverence's always willing and obedient servant, Hans Schmid.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning, piety, and humanity, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his much-respected lord and patron. Zürich.</p>
