      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Church of Zürich, my dearest brother in Christ and always to be revered, Pietro Parisotti of Bergamo wishes grace and peace through Jesus Christ and sends many greetings.</p>
      <p>Although I have never seen you in person, I know you very well in spirit, through your widespread fame, and finally through the reading of your most learned writings published on the Holy Scriptures. Nevertheless, I did not hesitate to send you this letter - confident that you, a man endowed with the highest humanity, would not disregard it, partly because it is written by someone who, due to the multitude of your many virtues, is very fond of you, and partly because it is delivered by such a prudent and virtuous young man, namely the beloved son of the magnificent Mr. Jakob Bifrontis -, firstly to visit you with this letter of mine, to greet you meanwhile with a joyful heart, embracing you with a holy kiss, and secondly to inform you that I recently read your excellent little work titled "On the Sole Grace of God Justifying" with the greatest delight of my heart, which a certain faithful person lent me to read.</p>
      <p>Since I am greatly desirous of having it, I would therefore like to ask you to kindly send it to me along with that truly golden work of yours, the greatest treasure, titled "Five Decades of Sermons", and whatever price you ask for them, I will faithfully pay you. Finally, since I know you are endowed with no less great charity than much learning and piety, as is clearly seen daily towards the Christians of Locarno, for the relief of whose cross you have been and are so greatly fatigued, from which work I beseech you not to desist, I did not want to remain silent about this, but to remind you of my poverty and commend myself to you as much as possible, knowing for certain that if the Lord, whose hand is not shortened, provides any opportunity, you will retain the memory of me, especially when the recommendation of the most illustrious Mr. Pietro Paolo Vergerio, my lord, whom I know you uniquely revere, is added. For I am a stranger in a foreign land with my wife and children for six years now. The stipend I receive annually from my ministry is meager, the scarcity of sustenance and almost all things in these regions is great; add also that due to the tyranny of the Antichrist and the cruelty, hatred, and greed of our relatives, we cannot even have a penny from our own produce. But such is the lot of Christians who wish to profess the Christian religion, about which our Lord Jesus Christ wanted all the faithful to be well advised, saying: "A man's enemies will be the members of his own household."</p>
      <p>Farewell, most revered brother, whom I ask the heavenly Father, through His beloved Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, to keep long alive for the expansion of Christ's kingdom and the overthrowing and utterly casting down of the kingdom of the Antichrist.</p>
      <p>In Samaden, on the eighth day of May 1556.</p>
      <p>Minister of the Church of Samaden and yours, Pietro Parisotti of Bergamo.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the Church of Zürich, my most revered lord. In Zürich.</p>
