      <p>Although I am suffering from poor health and am tormented by severe and dangerous pain in my sides, having found a faithful courier, I cannot refrain from sending my letters along with those of Doctor Peter to you. Therefore, I hope you will forgive their rusticity. Reninger, a very learned man and a lover of yours, will bring to you the letters of the Prince of Dorchester along with those of Oglendorp. He will soon depart for Zürich to print the English Bible. I hope you have already received the full and complete title of the Warwicks. It would be most gratifying to both if the book is described by you for them jointly. But I urge and advise you again and again to carefully consider with yourself how advisable it is for the future decade's exemplar to be offered to the Warwicks through Hooper. For our Martyr has most certainly reported that he has lost all favor with almost all the leading men, especially with the Warwick, and his affairs are in such a difficult position that if the best Prince of Dorchester and the Archbishop of Canterbury had not interceded for him in the senate, he would have long been held in chains and prison, mainly because he is too importunate in abolishing the ministers' garments and rashly declares all those impious and wicked who wish to continue using them.</p>
      <p>The Archbishop of Canterbury and the Bishop of London also urge that the garments be abolished; however, they believe it should be done publicly with the consent of the whole kingdom, not by the rash power of one or only the counselors. I easily understood these things from Mr. Scinner recently, and yesterday from Doctor Peter. Therefore, you will consider what should be done in this matter according to your judgment. In my opinion, it would be much more prudent if it is delivered to the Warwick through Scinner or Treherne, men who are most beloved by you among all nations. Last year, when I gave your letters to Treherne, he was very pleased with their reading; however, he complained bitterly to me about Hooper for not returning your books to him and the letters once jointly described to both: which seems to me a certain sign that they are not yet properly reconciled.</p>
      <p>I assume you know the controversy and are not ignorant of the great learning and piety of both. Therefore, it is most grievous to be lamented.</p>
      <p>Cox, the head of the academy, was here on the 5th of January and stayed for a few days. When I had already decided to meet him, behold his servant, who calls me. I immediately went. He first inquired about you and Alexander, whom you had recommended to him, excusing himself for not having spoken to us about it earlier, with this reason: that he had long awaited Hooper, from whom he would learn the state of the boy, but had done so in vain. Therefore, he would learn the whole matter from us ourselves: as soon as he learned it, he immediately arranged for 15 crowns to be paid to the boy and dismissed me. I write this to you so that you may understand that your letters have had much weight and influence with this man, and likewise, you are required to write letters to him to give thanks for this his immortal benefit to us. We will always be diligent and industrious cultivators in honoring both of your excellences.</p>
      <p>What remains, although I have no doubt that, as before for our sake, now also for the sake of your constancy, you will remain in the same goodwill towards us; yet, my teacher, I earnestly and repeatedly ask you to wish that what you showed at the beginning, and then what you did, be increased and completed by you. You alone are the one among all who are influential with the leading men, and you have first decided to help and protect us with your counsel and protection. Therefore, I ask you as earnestly as possible to persevere in this goodwill towards us. If you give any book to the Warwick, send it to us along with the others: we will do nothing without the judgment and will of Treherne, provided they are delivered to some faithful person in Frankfurt. Byrkmann is negligent and not at all reliable; therefore, beware of them. It will be safest to have them delivered here through the Cellar of Mr. Gwalther's relative, whom I do not doubt will do it for your or the lord's sake. I would like you to send a copy to the daughter of the prince: you will never regret the deed (which I hope you will believe me). Let the form of the inscription be this: To Johanna Grey, daughter of the Prince of Dorchester, etc. You will elicit the most learned and humane letters from her. A good part of that book on marriage, which I translated into Latin, she herself translated into Greek and gave it to her father as a New Year's gift on the day before the calends of January.</p>
      <p>Here everything is quiet and established in the deepest peace. The Archbishop of Ireland, I mean of Dublin, who was so long opposed to the king in religion, has now voluntarily joined our side and has completely bid farewell to the Roman pontiff. Walter Scott, who was once with us here and later went to Ireland, is now said to have passed away. I have learned all these things to be true from an Irishman. Farewell, most excellent and learned man, and you will be greatly greeted by Stumphius and Alexander.</p>
      <p>I would like you to convey my greetings to Zwingli, your father-in-law, and to Ziegler, my brother, in my words. I would write to him if I were not hindered by ill health. Oxford, 1551, the day before the calends of January.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your dignity, Johannes von Ulm, your disciple.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and patron to be respected.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
