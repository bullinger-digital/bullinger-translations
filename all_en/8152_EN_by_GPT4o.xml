      <p>Gentlemen, I am sending this bearer to you to hear your good news, which you will share with me if you please. You will be able to understand what the letters I am writing to the mayor convey through him.</p>
      <p>As for the news from here, I know nothing else except that the young Lausac and the abbot of Bourmeyen are in Germany, soliciting to have eight thousand reiters and a large number of landsknechts. Every effort is being made to prevent this, and it seems that if this levy is prevented and efforts are made to prevent those of the Swiss, we will have peace in France, for the king has dismissed his Italians and has recently dismissed three regiments of his reiters, so that their last effort lies in this new aid of foreigners they are seeking at this time. May God grant us all the grace to faithfully employ our talents in this matter, and we beseech you, gentlemen, to serve as advocates for the churches of France in all places where you think your labor can serve, assuring you that it can never be better employed in this regard. I present my humble recommendations to your good graces and prayers, as on my part I pray to God, gentlemen, to make your ministry valuable to the glory of His name and the salvation of His church, granting you a very happy and good life.</p>
      <p>From Basel, this 27th of January.</p>
      <p>Gentlemen, I ask you to inform me if there is soon to be a meeting of the gentlemen of the Leagues.</p>
      <p>Your obedient friend and good brother Vezines.</p>
      <p>Gentlemen, gentlemen Bullinger and Galter, ministers of the word of God in Zurich.</p>
      <p>The Baron of Vezines.</p>
