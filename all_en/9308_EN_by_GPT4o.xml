      <p>We have received your letters, in which you request our opinion on the election of Duke Heinrich, brother of Charles, King of France, as King of Poland, asking what we advise on this matter and how, with him being made king, the French churches might be provided for with some certain conditions and agreements. Although we, honorable lords and dearest brothers, are prepared to serve you and your churches and their illustrious, noble, and magnificent patrons even at the risk of life and blood, it is nevertheless difficult for us to respond to what you ask, as neither the state of your kingdom nor the condition of the French churches is known to us at this time. However, we hope that our brothers in Geneva, who have a better understanding of French affairs and not only the state of the churches but also the French court and the character and manners of Heinrich himself, as many great and renowned men who recently fled the bloody hands of enemies in France now reside in that city, will fully satisfy your wishes. We can indeed affirm in good faith, based on what we have learned from many eyewitnesses and trustworthy sources, that contrary to all agreements, treaties, and oaths, such cruel acts have been committed against the pious in France that no similar example of this brutality exists, as is affirmed by all. Certainly, his bodyguards held a leading role in that cruel massacre in Paris. And the same Heinrich, as is known to all, is besieging La Rochelle, where many of the faithful have taken refuge, with great force. And we know that rebellion is charged against us, as this world has always tried to burden the pious with this crime. But they have abundantly cleared themselves in previous wars and recently also in public writings. However, what good can be hoped for from one who so eagerly wages war against the church, and what faith can be placed in agreements in such a time of past treachery, we leave for you to conjecture. Nothing could indeed be more pleasing to us than if, through you, some way of peace could be prepared for the churches and the entire kingdom of France, which is now in great turmoil. However, as we cannot discern what that might be, nor can we point out to you what is our duty, we urge you in the Lord to pour out prayers without ceasing, both privately and publicly, to our Lord God, that in His mercy He may not give you a king, as it is in Hosea, in His wrath, but out of His mercy and power a pious, wise, benevolent, and strong king. You know that of Daniel, the Lord is the one who deposes kings and establishes kings and grants wisdom to the wise. Therefore, seek a holy king from the Lord.</p>
      <p>We too will join our prayers with yours as much as we can. May the Lord bless you and keep you from all evil.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich, May 2, 1573.</p>
