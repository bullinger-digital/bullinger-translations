      <p>Greetings. I could not read the second part of your letters without the greatest pain of mind, most humane man. For I easily see that you, who have always been devoted to the church of Christ with utmost faith, have been harassed for a long time by impure men without any merit of your own. But in such a great light of the gospel, I did not think that such absurd doctrines, long since exploded by Christians through the divine word, could be so stubbornly revived at this time. But what does Satan not daily plot and contrive against the faithful servants of Christ? Indeed, I think there is no pious and learned person who does not affirm from the word of God that you have more than adequately responded to each of Brentius's errors and refuted, if there is anything of that kind (I say nothing of the insults, to which you, in your piety, wish to respond nothing). What need was there, then, to bring forth anew the old foolishness with a new writing? Truly, what are you doing, my father? Unless you had seen other winds, unless you had foreseen other storms in your mind, these things would move you more than, I think, they do. Yet it pains me deeply that your venerable old age, which was dedicated to much greater matters, is occupied with handling these. We pray to the all-powerful God that He may continually supply you with that constancy of mind, which you have gloriously relied upon up to this age, so that, as you have always resisted evils, you may thus at last reach the honor and triumph of Christian victory, as no good person doubts will happen. As for those three young men you have sent to us and commend to me so earnestly, you do this, my father, out of your humanity towards them and me at the same time. Therefore, I, who have always valued the church of Zürich as much as it ought to be valued by me, will neglect nothing that seems to concern these young men.</p>
      <p>It will be your part, most distinguished men, to consider my modesty favorably. Concerning the assembly of the Bernese with the envoys of Savoy, since I have nothing certain, I write nothing; but you will hear certain and indeed individual things from others, as I hope. In France, as Mr. Beza writes, matters are a little more disturbed than before, while each party indulges in suspicions. The king's arrival is expected daily in Lyon; may it be fruitful for the church! But God will look upon His own and will surpass even our hope.</p>
      <p>That faithful servant of God, Mr. Calvin, once a singular example of excellent virtues in life, now indeed in death, is daily declining towards destruction, although it is in God's power to restore him.</p>
      <p>He was brought these days, as we hear, to the senate, where he delivered a remarkable speech to the senators and citizens and at the same time bid them farewell. These are, in my judgment, not obscure traces of divine wrath against us, that so many excellent instruments have been taken from us in such a short time. Therefore, you, my father, in whom the greatest hope of the more sincere church is placed, live and fare well happily.</p>
      <p>May the Lord preserve you safe with us for a long time! I rejoice that you are excellently free from that contagious plague.</p>
      <p>May God grant you and us His peace!</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father.</p>
      <p>Greet all your noble ones and friends with my words. Lausanne, May 22, 1564.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Blaise Marcuard.</p>
      <p>To the most virtuous and pious man, Mr. Huldrych Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, my lord and venerable father. In Zürich.</p>
