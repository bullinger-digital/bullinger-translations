      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. That Caspar of yours delivered your letter to me on the fifth of September, along with the honorary gift from the prince, which I immediately tried to offer upon entering the court, but I was hindered by the noise of both nobles and courtiers coming and going. I tried again after lunch, and it went successfully; for he was sitting among the court counselors sent by Duke Christoph. I offered it, he received it, and after reading the letter, he returned both the letters and the booklets to me, entrusting them to my care and faith, to return them after the wedding; then he wished to respond to you, freed from the noise, etc. Therefore, he gives you great thanks, asking you and your fellow ministers to make diligent prayers to God, so that the marriage, which has been long delayed and is now underway, is not disturbed by Satan's cunning.</p>
      <p>How magnificent the preparations are, in earnest, with gold and silver and cups, and how many Apicius-like chefs are taking care of the kitchen, I cannot briefly express; Caspar will report everything.</p>
      <p>Duke of Württemberg is expected tomorrow with two hundred horsemen, counts, and nobles; Wolfgang, Duke of Zweibrücken, will be present with no less preparation, as well as two Palatines, two Margraves of Baden, and the one they call from Hunsrück. Tyrant Henry of Brunswick was invited; but that goose will fear to mingle with the swans. More counts, the Count of Staufen, of Sulz, of Tübingen, of Hanau, of Bitsch, of Fürstenberg, and many others, whose names the constraints of this letter do not allow me to list. After the wedding, I will write to you about each detail in order.</p>
      <p>The wedding will be on the 11th of this month, etc. May I be well with the brothers, from Caspar, who sends greetings to you all. Therefore, farewell and in turn greet your brothers. In Riquewihr, September 6, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erb.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man of piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief theologian and preacher among the people of Zürich, brother.</p>
