      <p>Greetings in Christ. Dearest sir, your letters were most welcome to me for many reasons: because they presented the venerable Mr. Vergerius to be embraced in person, and because they were written by you, whom I greatly esteem for your zeal in aiding the church, as your own works testify, and because they provided an opportunity to establish acquaintance with your family, a learned young man. I saw Mr. Vergerius with great joy and cheerfulness; for since he preferred to be cast out in the house of God rather than dwell in the tents of the wicked, and considered the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures of the Egyptians, I regard him as a distinguished example of piety divinely set before us. What could be more fitting or more disastrous for our papal enemies than for them to continue to expel such men, of whom I believe there is a notable abundance among them, from their assembly, so that they join us, that is, the true church of Christ? For they do not merely cast out men, but the instruments of the Son of God, indeed the Son of God himself. Thus, they deprive themselves of divine benefits and hasten to their own destruction. You know that the Lord once declared that he could not bring any punishment upon the Sodomites until Lot had left their borders. Certainly, at this time too, our enemies are exposed to imminent destruction because the best men are deserting them. Let us therefore continue to fight against them with a cheerful spirit, and since we have been strengthened by the addition of Mr. Vergerius to our church, a man adorned with great learning, wisdom, and piety, let us give thanks to God and treat the man with our services in such a way that he truly feels that among us there is what we profess, the pursuit of Christian charity.</p>
      <p>I also ask you and your colleagues to commend us and our churches to the Lord in your prayers, a duty which we likewise perform for you. Farewell well and happily.</p>
      <p>Tübingen, June 6, 1553.</p>
      <p>Johannes Brenz.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man of great piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, teacher of the Gospel of Christ in Zürich, his lord and friend to be respected in Christ.</p>
