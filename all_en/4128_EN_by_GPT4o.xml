      <p>Greetings. We must work diligently against that most depraved man from the Quadriis, who relies on the support of some unknown individuals. It is certain that he has already made a donation and has placed twelve Spanish men and two other priests in possession, who would perform their sacred rites, and the governor of the Valtellina (commonly called the captain), who holds supreme authority in those parts, has ratified this donation. Behold the extreme impudence of men! What would you do now if you were here? We shout from the throat, sometimes grasping these, sometimes those by the hand, leaving nothing untried.</p>
      <p>We win the case again: a senate decree is made against the monks and the captain, very harsh; all actions of the captain are rescinded; the monks are ordered to leave the Valtellina. But these things will not cease with such a pivotal change in affairs.</p>
      <p>That other faction is powerful; but Christ with his own is more powerful. If you seek more, the noble man Rudolf Landolf will tell you, who himself also vigorously defends the cause of Christ. To this is added another evil.</p>
      <p>A certain peasant in the Upper League boasts of some angelic apparition; for he says that he saw an angel, who ordered three chapels to be built in those places and mass to be celebrated in them, a work clearly apostolic, which, since it was interrupted, has brought much harm to these regions. You would see people astonished, believing the peasant, you would see frequent gatherings at that place, wood, stones, and cement being brought, so that such a pious work may be accomplished. And what is more, the brothers who come from there report that a certain community named This tis confirms the peasant's words with intervening public authority, with diplomas and a seal, by which testimony he, relying on it, proceeds to neighboring Switzerland to also share this joyful vision. The same brothers report that they have seen letters written by the Three Leagues to the people of the Upper League, in which they reproach them for supporting men proscribed by them against the heads of the league. This is against Beccaria.</p>
      <p>Some news comes from Rome, the summary of which Mr. Philipp has translated from Italian into Latin.</p>
      <p>I have nothing more now.</p>
      <p>All of ours wish you well.</p>
      <p>Give my greetings and those of my wife to all of yours, especially to the most distinguished men, my patrons. Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, November 20, 1559.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, excellent in learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and patron, always to be respected.</p>
