    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius finds enclosed the response from Vadian to Myconius’ letter [from September 7, 1545]; he is to return it. Bullinger, for his part, has read Myconius’ letter [No. 2243 from September 13] to his colleagues, all of whom warn against Schwenckfeld. - The [Zurichers] respond as follows: Schwenckfeld has published several unacceptable writings and has already been refuted by Vadian. Yet he persists in his false teachings. Therefore, the Zurichers are not willing to engage in a conversation with him. If Schwenckfeld has any objections to the [Confederates], as suggested by his poem [“A beautiful new song about the divinity and glory of our Lord Jesus Christ”], he should present them in writing. Should the [Zurichers] then deem it necessary and appropriate, they would respond to him. They do not wish to engage further with Schwenckfeld. - Bullinger had not heard anything about [Johannes] Bader until now, nor does he know his successor [Johannes Liebmann]. - The city clerk [Werner] Beyel has passed away. - For a few days, Bullinger had the pleasure of hosting Georg Frölich, whom he greatly esteems. He sends his regards. - Bullinger awaits Myconius’ response to his letters.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You will understand what Mr. Joachim Vadian responds to your letters from the enclosed documents, which you will undoubtedly consider with your usual kindness, and after reading, return them.</p>
      <p>As for us, I have read your letters to our colleagues and brothers. They all greet you and urge you to beware of Schwenckfeld and his followers; for he is a bad man, a notable hypocrite, and has very fierce disciples who are always ready to slander.</p>
      <p>We unanimously respond as follows: Caspar Schwenckfeld has published several writings that we cannot accept at all, and the more he explains himself, the more confused he becomes. He has been extensively informed about this by Mr. Vadian, and the matter has been sufficiently dealt with in writing as far as necessary. However, he never allows himself to be satisfied and continues with his teachings. Therefore, we cannot and do not want to burden ourselves further with him, and we do not give any occasion for any conversation, as we do not hope for any benefit from it. He has not achieved so much fruit and peace in the places where he has been that we feel any need for him. Until now, we have entrusted the churches of Christ with our administration and service, preaching Christ.</p>
      <p>If Schwenckfeld has any complaints against us, let him present them in writing; let him show that we in Switzerland (as the Schwenckfeldian poem suggests) are blaspheming and dishonoring Christ. If we then find it necessary and good, we will respond to him; if not, we will leave it aside until its time. Furthermore, we do not want to burden ourselves with Schwenckfeld and will remain unconcerned about him in the future. We hope that our response will be met with understanding and no dishonor by all reasonable people.</p>
      <p>I have not heard anything about Bader until now, nor do I know who succeeded him. There is no news here, except that our city clerk Bygelius has passed away.</p>
      <p>The distinguished man Georg Frölich was here with me, with whom I enjoyed myself for a few days; he is indeed my friend and a singular brother. He instructed me to greet you diligently in his name.</p>
      <p>I cannot write more now. I await your response to this and previous letters. Farewell. Zurich, September 28, 1545, at 12 noon.</p>
      <p>Yours as always, B.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Oswald Myconius, dearest brother. In Basel.</p>
