      <p>God and all good things. Especially beloved lord and brother. I have received your letter, to which I do not have the time or inclination to respond unnecessarily; I would also like to inform you of various news concerning me. I will eagerly await the writings of Calvin, which you mentioned to me. I would also like to read Brentius's advice, if you have it at hand.</p>
      <p>Regarding our matter, of which you are aware, I was in Winterthur eight days ago and made a proposal on my behalf, as well as on behalf of my dear brother, in case he considers settling there (since it might still take some time before he could buy a seat). They have shown themselves to be very friendly and willing, with much favorable and Christian offers; I like the situation there very much for many reasons, although our situation in Thurgau would be much better and greater; but not what we want, but what we can. So we want to wait patiently for what the market will show us and what answer we will receive in Baden.</p>
      <p>From Constance, I cannot write anything good, neither about what is happening now nor what can be hoped for in the future; it lingers, but does not improve. It is said again that fresh soldiers are supposed to come there; what this garrison means, if it is indeed so, can be easily guessed. People at home are falling away, as the council says, which is a great sorrow; I would not have thought it possible to experience such a defection in such a short time among many who were considered the best. Everyone corrupts their neighbor and rejoices when they also make another fall away, and then they seek a wonderful leniency, where in reality there is nothing but all misfortune.</p>
      <p>The pious, of whom there is still a small handful, are so oppressed, concealed, and tormented in their hearts that it would be more bearable for them to live in Turkey. Yet no one looks at their neighbor's harm and sorrow to improve themselves and protect against harm. The world is completely and entirely confused and in doubt. The foremost, who is in the council in Strasbourg and whom they send every day, having had great honor, has said: if he knew for sure that it pleased God, he would risk everything, life, honor, and goods; but these things have a wide account and there is much to consider in them, etc. Thus human cleverness and wisdom come and deceive themselves. But the offense of the cross of Christ will only begin in earnest when some of the evangelical preachers start to seek leniency and, for the sake of the book and safety, look back and turn the page, make cushions under people's elbows, and indulge and seek leniency for the vain, miserable, and too weak flesh, as Huberinus and some others are now doing, then many will fall in droves, even those who have previously stood and remained.</p>
      <p>Oh Lord God, how true it is, that Christ is set for the fall and rising again, etc. and that the ruin of that house was great, etc. May the Lord God give us animal courage, that we not only believe, but also, believing, that we may suffer everything for the sake of faith, in which faith we would gladly die. No one wants to put on the red robe of hope anymore; everyone wants to have it so that as long as one clings to God's word, until one begins to trust him, then it is enough, and he has preserved his honor well, may be well excused before God. If one advises someone to flee, he says: "Where should I go? Wherever I flee, I find what I shun at home; if it is not there yet, oh, before a year is out, it will be the same among the Confederates as it is with us. How can one do it? We are poor people; forced oaths are displeasing to God. God knows well what I carry in my heart; I will not accept another faith." With that, it should be well glossed over and justified, yes, if the Lord God did not also understand adventure and alchemy.</p>
      <p>In Bingen, a priest accepted and praised the Interim and immediately died a sudden death. In Rappoltskirchen, a priest who had been a preacher and presented himself as evangelical, after the Interim was issued, asked the subjects from the pulpit to pray to God for him to make a good start; for he would also let himself be swayed. And when he went out of the church again, some peasants asked him if he was serious; they thought he was joking. To which he said it was his true seriousness, took off his hat in the middle and bowed his head to the peasants, showing them that he had a bald spot; a peasant immediately struck him on the bald spot with a stick, so that he fell to the ground and went home with a bloody head. He accused the peasant harshly; but the count of Rappoltskirchen said to the priest: if he wants to be there, he should behave so that the peasants can tolerate him; otherwise, he cannot protect him.</p>
      <p>He had himself absolved by his wife, put her out of the house; but she had a house right next to the priest's house; the peasants swore they would keep a close watch, and as soon as they noticed once that he went to her or she to the priest, they would blow out their light.</p>
      <p>My dear brother-in-law Peter Schär has been here for a few days; he sends you his very willing, Christian service with many, many greetings and all good things, desiring your faithful intercession. His sister is in Zweibrücken with the duchess there, who is the daughter of the landgrave. She told him wonderfully how she is such a splendid, Christian princess, young, but of such seriousness and zeal in all her being and conduct, the like of which she has never seen before. She constantly worries that her lord, Duke Wolfgang of Zweibrücken, might do or approve something to please the emperor that is against God; that is her highest and greatest concern; she often says with great sighs: "Oh, that it would come to this, that we would be driven out for God's sake! How easy it must be for me, then I should experience the other!" The emperor has written to the duke several times regarding the Interim; he finally said he would let happen what the bishop arranges. The emperor was not satisfied with this, but wanted to know what he personally thought of the Interim, to which he gave him a very good Christian answer, for which he was in great fear and concern. Oh, that a true example of Christian steadfastness could be seen and we would not stand all naked, bare, and shameful before the eyes of the whole world, so that everyone would have just cause to blame us and our gospel as disgraceful!</p>
      <p>It is indeed a pitiable, dreadful sorrow that God, with all these his highest blessings, has no more power over the ungrateful world than that it throws itself away so shamefully and scandalously. Oh, that a Confederation would have so much grace and be struck by so many great people's misfortunes and punishments, would turn to God with earnestness, be appeased, and thus be a remnant of the German lands, through which a sanctified seed of the Lord would still be preserved. Well, where there is the same reason, there is the same law. It is to be feared, as things are developing everywhere, that the cup of God's wrath must go around and reach them too. But may the dear God still hold back for a while and give peace, so that many other people may have protection and shelter among and under them and praise and glorify his name!</p>
      <p>That you inform us about our dear Metzler and Funckli, I feel your love and loyalty. But it does not suit them to run around and offer themselves like that, unless it were another service than in the ministry, where it truly does not fit. I have wanted to recommend Curio to a school, etc. But I would like the dear, pious Metzler to be called without his running and seeking, yes, that he knew nothing about it beforehand. You and I and others can well act on behalf of others without their involvement when we think that a church would be well provided for with them.</p>
      <p>Metzler is old, he should be where there is not much work, etc. Funckli is a fine, young, capable man; I will not say more. I ask you to keep both of them in mind. Bartholomeus has no vocation at all; Funckli is still in Tägerwilen, how long, God knows well; he is a great thorn in the eyes of the authorities in the city; he says he wants to get him away.</p>
      <p>Now letters come to me, in which I am told of wonders by Doctor Veltin in the city, how cruelly he slanders and defames me in the sermon and in houses; I must see how I can purify myself by necessity among the pious. He says I have never wanted to give a speech or answer to anyone in Württemberg or elsewhere, have always fled. He sought me at the Reichstag in Hagenau; there they said I was gone. He knows how I behaved in Tübingen; I left my wife in Constance and committed much debauchery with pretty girls in Württemberg. He wants to convict me of this; they should ask me what I did with a girl in the upper room at the inn Zum Wolf in Tübingen, etc. How I have dishonored the sacrament, so he wants to dishonor me too, so that the people of Constance must say they should have torn me apart with glowing tongs. I have made the mass a mockery and stripped it naked; therefore he wants to put it back on and adorn it, and he has already found a way through good people in Thurgau that he wants to come to me at the castle, whether I will stand up to him, and wants to take others with him, etc. I cannot write it all down. Oh, would God that he came!</p>
      <p>What would I suffer there. Yet it must all be written down; otherwise, there is nothing too much for the good people to chatter about. I must always think about how to act, so that, as much as possible, offense is avoided.</p>
      <p>I commend to you to the highest degree possible our Hieronymus Kaufmann's son. He desires to be promoted to the scholarship for the poor, where he has food and bread. Oh, the dear man is truly worthy; he is a pious young man, who encounters many difficulties. My dear sister, brother, and wife send you many, many services, good wishes, and greetings, also to your Christian wife and all the household. Praying to God for me. In the greatest haste; I do not know if I will finish... in Wynfelden when Herr Martin the pastor wants...</p>
      <p>Given on the 5th of May 1549.</p>
