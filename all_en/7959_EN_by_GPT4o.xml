      <p>S. Finally, I am sending back to you all your things. I recently wrote to you via Count of Culenburg about how Füglinus came here laden with letters from Sultzer and what he revealed here. In the meantime, nothing has been attempted by those foreigners, as far as I know; perhaps they will first greet the people of Aarau.</p>
      <p>I know indeed what kind of minds the Belgians, Spaniards, and Italians have; but we must be vigilant and at the same time do something because of the present necessity. They are ready to swear to our confession and to suffer the penalty of death if they attempt anything against it. However, I still do not know what they will achieve here or in Aarau if they try. In the meantime, I have received letters from Geneva, which I am sending along; however, I think you have already received all of them before. Return them to me with Füglinus's writing.</p>
      <p>It was almost the case that the Count of Culenburg was intercepted through treachery, as I believe you have understood from him. We have not yet heard anything about the good Scriniger, how his affairs are since he was taken to Cambrai. The people of Geneva soon came here complaining about those injuries. A letter is being written to the prince; however, I see that everything is directed here so that the people of Geneva are exercised and wearied. This is now the third Scriniger, as I hear, whom the duke has captured; if they do the same in return, there will be open war. In the meantime, it is his cunning to treat the ministers of the returned region very well, so that they cannot complain about him. It reminds me of the old matters; if the war began, it also started with capturing and fighting. May God will that it ends well!</p>
      <p>How truly I rejoice that you have returned to your sermons. May the Lord grant that you can serve him for a long time yet, lively and vigorous!</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, take care of yourself, so that you do not exhaust yourself with your own labors. We all indeed marvel, and not without reason, that you can still work so much; in the meantime, we enjoy your labors with joy and long to see your history of the popes.</p>
      <p>As for Sultzer, he impudently imposes himself on everyone, even on those whom he knows are not of his party; he writes to them, he flatters them. He also writes to me, and more frequently than I would like, and only for this reason (as I interpret it), so that he can write to others more freely and with less suspicion. What he writes to them, I do not know; however, I promise you that he indeed has not a few friends here, but the cause that he perhaps secretly pursues does not have many friends. The public doctrine is sound, as is what is taught in the school. Aretias explains and handles this matter very well both in lectures and in daily examinations; but no one dares to speak against our doctrine even in private conversations. Musculus sometimes seems to exceed moderation in his fervor on our part. Therefore, there is nothing for you to fear from here; only that little fox rejoices in making us suspicious of those whose faith we otherwise do not doubt. These things must be endured as long as it seems good to the Lord; may he keep us from evil. I wanted to add this because in your letters you seem to fear more danger than I can see here. Meanwhile, we must be vigilant and pray.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest lord and compater. Both consuls and treasurers greet you, Diesbach, father-in-law, and wife.</p>
      <p>Steiger recently wrote to Muralto; I think there is some response from the consul of Mühlhausen contained there. If there is nothing, I will take the opportunity to pull his ear; I know that his mind is not alien to his son-in-law. But the wife has more acrimony with clove.</p>
      <p>Bern, August 11, 1569.</p>
      <p>Yours, whom you know well.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compater.</p>
      <p>M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
