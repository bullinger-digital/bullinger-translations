      <p>I wonder, however, if it is true that the people of Lucerne were the first to report our disturbances to you; indeed, they anxiously fear the papacy and the monks and their leader, the Rhaetian, and wherever they can, they will diligently prevent any harm from befalling them, even with the help of others. However, I fear that all is in vain; for our peasants are so fervent that, caring little for the magistrate, they have now proposed to act in his stead and introduce a new reformation, stirred by that monstrous injustice and the shameless corruptions of some, by which they have long had both the fatherland and religion for sale, and have made light of the innocent blood ensnared by the plots of the papists and the negligence of the evangelicals. Thirteen and all the primary signs have already flown from the House of God and the 10 Jurisdictions, whose fixed intention is not to depart until they have uprooted some unfortunate tares. The Rhaetian, who has hitherto used the patronage of the Upper League, will be brought today. Indeed, when his fortune stands at its worst, he will drag many others with him into ruin. The leaders of the Upper or Grey League will not suffer anything harsh to be done to their head and lord, unless the most corrupt from other Leagues are also brought to light.</p>
      <p>Hence, the loss of many is to be feared. The removal of pensioners has deeply taken root in some; but if they plunge into this ocean, they will have more business than they will ever be able to exhaust. However, some, perhaps less favorable to the king, are pressing, especially since those deprived of their stipends by the lust of Mr. Conradin Plantan (who consulted his safety by flight) are all the more ardent, the more unjust their loss has been.</p>
      <p>All the soldiers and their leaders declare in many ways that they will harm no one beyond right and wrong, but will punish with moderating justice, maintaining a proper order of law, whomever they find to be traitors to the fatherland and religion. From the leaders, the peasants have attracted many to their side and have appointed unwilling leaders over the signs and entire armies, provided that, if necessary, they are present and share the penalties with others. Hence it has happened that some from the House of God, who at first seemed to side with the Rhaetian, are now compelled to act and fight against him with changed sails. Thus, there will be less faith, but more business, and everything will be all the more dangerous, as this is truer: Nowhere is faith safe. Unless effective intercessions intervene, by which that fury may be somewhat softened, I fear, indeed I fear, that a better state may have to be redeemed with the heads of some. I too have been able to be safer so far, because all those approaching have been friends to us. But since today the Rhaetian is guarded by the arms of his supporters in expectation, I seem to have as many enemies approaching as those from the Upper League who labor for his favor. For a long time now, his son-in-law, a furious man drunk with a heap of riches, has threatened my destruction. What then will happen when that giant, for whom not a few will risk their heads and lives, is in danger of his life? But in the hand of the Lord is our life, who also has the number of our fallen hairs.</p>
      <p>I would not much commit myself to the public, were it not for the cause of the Italian monks, which many are planning to defend, that we must attack. For now, unless they are expelled, they will later take deeper root; for how shameless their legations are, which entered the day before yesterday, is sufficiently declared by the fact that they do not blush to extenuate so many manifest robberies, therefore they will intercede as supplicants for the scoundrels.</p>
      <p>The signs of the Rhucantians are inclined towards the destruction of the monks, to which neither the Engadiners nor the Pregallians will be lacking. If we have gained this one fruit, it will have been enough for us to have fought. The bishop, who has become somewhat deaf from a certain illness, is not in much danger, as his castle is moderately fortified by the city, and more account is taken of the priests than of us. Certainly, nothing is indicated to us by our magistrate as to where things stand or what we should do if it comes to arms, perhaps having little confidence in us, because we do not present ourselves as public enemies to the soldiers, whom some wounded would wish to be expelled from the city by any means. For it is not enough for some that the troops are not admitted and even fewer admitted, that the custody of the closed gates is carefully maintained, unless they also arm their corners and houses in the middle of the city with weapons and bombards, as Mr. Consul Ambrosius did in recent days. Some wonder at this plan and gather little favorable from here and there, nor indeed are all our citizens in agreement, to whom not everything is revealed, but all are compelled to expose their lives, if necessary.</p>
      <p>Never before have the allies been allowed to expose their intention and the impulsive causes of this to the common citizens. Hence many complain that they are ignorant and unaware of the matters and dangers or rather the true causes of this evil, and are kindled to defense. They fear that they will be dealt with in the same way as in previous years, when the Spanish legation had poured out much money and some had filled their purses to the brim. Afterwards, when the fury of the Engadiners was pressing, they were authors and persuaders to the other citizens to defend the city bravely, whose safety the Engadiners were plotting against. But this was not true; rather, the business was presented to a few most corrupt, who, to be safe, bound the citizens to themselves with a new oath of defense. Thus it is to be feared today, lest a few wish to heal and cover their own sores at the peril of all others. We both ministers, somewhat doubting, approached Mr. Consul the day before yesterday and inquired where things stood or what we should do and how we should conduct ourselves, etc. He replied to us most amicably that he trusted us with all honest and good things and that he was well agreed with himself and the citizens and would not usurp any violence (unless provoked), indeed he would admit more (if it cannot be otherwise) and, relying on justice with others, was prepared to cut out the evil from the midst; if it came to arms, which they by no means believe, they hoped that we would also provide common assistance to the citizens. We replied: since we do not know what they are always planning, it does not seem right to us that a few should involve themselves in the common misery. It is better to punish the guilty while preserving the innocent, not dragging them into the same mire. - I write this to you most secretly (for I do not want it to be communicated to your Rhaetians, who write everything back here (you know what I mean) and spread some reputation about me, as if I, full of leaks, reveal everything to you - and for this reason Pontisella most unjustly tore me apart not long ago, as you will hear with pain sometime in person) -, I write this, I say, so that with your singular insight and prudence you may understand what hope or danger hangs over these disturbances. If our people continue to act amicably, I would hope for a better form of both the republic and the church, which have hitherto served the lust of a few, once the rigor of judgment is completed. If one life is taken, others will not bear this unpunished. The war expenses are increasing so much that I would also hope that the greater part of the soldiers, as soon as the form of judgment is instituted and formed, will depart, leaving not a few who will both execute the judgment and defend it with arms. But the Lord alone knows the outcome, who may deign to grant the desired result. Now our intention is to approach the consuls and again inquire where things stand and what letters they have received from your lords, also advising them not to lend an easy ear to the legations of the monks."</p>
      <p>Chur, in the year 1572, March 21.</p>
      <p>My colleague has written about a miracle given in the sun; but because he was forced to depend on the words of others, I too will inquire and, if anything seems less pleasing to German ears, I will change it and send it to you for printing. It would greatly affect our people at this time if it were published.</p>
