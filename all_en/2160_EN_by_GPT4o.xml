      <p>Greetings. My Jonah, covered in scabs and suffering from urinary retention, returned home sick. I received him as someone degenerate and completely despaired; what I will eventually do with him, I do not yet know. The expenses he incurred in Zurich, both useful and useless, I will soon settle either myself or through a certain person, I pray that the creditors allow a small delay; currently, there was no courier to whom the money could be entrusted. I am very grateful to you and your son-in-law, an excellent man, for the correction made regarding my son, although in vain. For the Lord punishes me more than him for his wickedness, for whose grace you will earnestly implore with me, that He may lead him back to the right path. Amen. Before Jonah's arrival, you wrote to me; but the letters finally reached me long after. Among other things, you wished that I would undertake the task of translating your sermons on the sacraments in your Decades, which, although I am very busy, I would gladly do. However, because the Augsburg magistrate forcibly retains my collection of books along with your letters and those of other most learned men of our age, and your sermons are not in my hands, I am prevented from complying, since I am now in a vehement dispute and contention with the Augsburgers regarding the terms and the previous agreement. They have treated me so unjustly that they refuse to pay the agreed and deserved salary; therefore, I was forced to seek the help of our prince, Otto Henry. Through intermediaries, the magistrates are calling me back to the city, promising an honorable position and good remuneration; but since I know well that this is done cunningly and wickedly by them, I prefer to live frugally for myself and my family rather than to mismanage the republic with others.</p>
      <p>The affairs of the empire have never been worse from the beginning of its origin than now; some adhere to the Emperor, some to King Ferdinand, some to the French, and some depend on themselves. Alliances are struck against alliances among the orders, so disparate in terms of religion and morals, that you would sooner believe fire and water could unite than they could with each other. Therefore, the evils of Germany are so far from decreasing that it seems impossible to me for the situation to persist much longer. Convey my greetings to the entire crown of piety. Farewell. Quickly from Lauingen, January 16, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours, Georg Frölich von Lömnitz, counselor to the Elector Palatine.</p>
      <p>To the pious and highly learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church in Zurich, etc., my particularly dear lord and friend, to be delivered.</p>
