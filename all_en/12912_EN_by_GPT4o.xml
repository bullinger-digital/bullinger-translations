    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Now comes (as already announced with the letter [not received] that Blarer had given to the messenger [...] of Bullinger) the servant [...] from Marcell Dietrich von Schankwitz. He submits the proposal [for the purchase of Dübelstein Castle to the Zurich authorities]. Bullinger should follow Blarer's instructions if inquiries are made to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Captain [Hans] Schnabel [von Schönstein], who is now in Nuremberg, is said to have lost an arm in the battle [at Rochlitz] (which Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony won for himself).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Yesterday, a letter arrived from the Constance messenger [Hans] Wolff, who was sent with letters to Saxony on March 1st. In it, he reports how he was arrested by two nobles in the service of Maximilian of Egmont, Count of Buren, and the letters (including those of Sebastian Schertlin) were confiscated. They held him captive for a long time so that the people of Constance would not immediately learn of the loss of their letters. He had to pay a high ransom of 100 thalers. For the council, the loss of the letters seems less severe than for Schertlin.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger should pray for the people of Constance. Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Many delegates are said to be going to Baden [for the Diet]. In Kreuzlingen, mercenaries [for Emperor Charles V.] are being recruited. May the Lord finally grant peace!</p>

      <p>Dear sir and trusted, most faithful brother. Zöger is the servant of Marcell Dietrich, about whom I wrote to you with your messenger, that he would submit the proposal to you. Now, according to my trust, you should act on all points as I have written to you about it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Otherwise, we have no news since then, except that Captain Schnabel is in Nuremberg. He has lost an arm from his body in one of the battles that the Elector has conquered.</p>

      <p>Also, my lords' messenger, a man named Wolff, whom they sent with letters to Saxony on the first of March, was arrested by two noblemen belonging to the Count of Buren. They took all the letters from him (since Schertle also had letters with him) and held him for a long time so that people would think the letters had been delivered, and no one would immediately send others. It cost him a lot: he had to give them a hundred thalers! He wrote to my lords last night. That's how it goes in the world. I notice well that my lords are not particularly concerned about the letters. But with Schertle, it's somewhat more dangerous, though not entirely bad, etc.</p>

      <p>With that, may the Lord God be entrusted temporally and eternally. Praying for us without ceasing. Greet all yours and ours are also greeted by them. Dated the 28th of March.</p>

      <p>It is said that there is a great ride to Baden. Also, money is already being spent on the mercenaries in Kreuzlingen. May God finally grant us eternal peace. Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
