      <p>Greetings. Your letter, reverend father in Christ, has been delivered to me, albeit later than I could respond to it last week. We give you immense thanks for deeming us worthy to be so diligently instructed about all matters. The Saxons may rage as they will; Christ Jesus, who is the same yesterday, today, and forever, whom we preach, will ultimately achieve a glorious victory over all his enemies, unless the adversaries prefer to call the incarnate Son of God a new Christ, whom they indeed deny came in the flesh, from whom they remove and lift away the nature and property of the flesh. The things you write about the German bishops are horrendous; someone from Schellenberg has already written the same to our people about the WÃ¼rzburg bishop; he adds that among others in that conflict, the bishop's brother also fell, along with about nine courtiers. Some conjecture that this was done by the machinations of Margrave George, nephew of Frederick Albert, if I am not mistaken, etc. Whosoever's impulse this deed was, the German bishops will certainly be in great trepidation, for nothing will be safe and quiet for them henceforth; these events coincide with the beginnings of Ferdinand's reign; we will have more similar disturbances under this prince; for his power is not so great as to keep the Germans in line, whose empire is indeed almost precarious, and the body of the republic has already been convulsed and dissipated. Among us, there is the greatest silence.</p>
      <p>There is absolutely no news from Italy.</p>
      <p>One of the consuls has his son-in-law and relatives in the camp; but he himself solemnly affirms that he has had nothing for a long time. Some of the Emperor's men, who served under the Florentine, passed through here; but they too have nothing certain. Some predict that the Frenchman will by no means consent to the concord of the Italian princes, so that he may also distract Philip's forces. Among us, the issue of the pensioners is being discussed again.</p>
      <p>There is a certain valley named Tumlescha, which is diligently working to abjure all pensions of all princes. Our bishop and some others have interposed themselves (for the sake of conciliating the multitude), but in vain. The remaining communities are murmuring, waiting for some outcome of the matter.</p>
      <p>Next Thursday, there will be a meeting here, but now a bytag (a minor assembly) of the common Three Leagues; for, as you know, our people call minor assemblies a bytag, and major ones a pundstag. It is thought, however, that it will lead to a pundstag.</p>
      <p>The French are neither asleep nor idle. The royal legate has been absent (as you know) for several weeks.</p>
      <p>A new one is said to have been appointed in place of the old one, whose arrival is awaited. The French are pressing with letters for him to come quickly, and indeed laden with money, with which they hope to quell these tumults. This matter would pertain to some significant movement if the ministers of the church were to involve themselves more odiously in the business, and there would be a danger that some centurions might pay with their blood.</p>
      <p>But due to the fickleness of the common people and many other reasons, we remain quiet. It is strange, but I have been taught this by pious and trustworthy men: although pensions and military expeditions have been abjured about five times within a decade, yet always a return to the former institution has occurred without any execution. It has been forbidden under penalty of life and limb in the common Three Leagues to pledge allegiance to any foreign lord or to lead any servant out of the Leagues. But those who have led servants away against the prohibition, when they have returned home, have not only been welcomed by God; rather, some have gone out to meet them (whom one could well name) and have received them with a banquet, etc. You might say that the cause of this inconsistency is the form of the republic, which is composed of a mixture of oligarchy and democracy. For those who are more powerful have their clients, by whose votes, if necessary, they are elevated to dignities, etc. This matter often erupts into seditions due to party factions.</p>
      <p>I seem to be able to predict where this matter will end. The mountains are in labor, a ridiculous mouse will be born.</p>
      <p>The French faction prevails, not indeed in numbers, but in wealth and authority, and as these things are mutually complained about among us, I judge it impossible for the current state of the republic to remain safe and intact for long; which others more prudent also seem to foresee. For, to leave aside these political matters, how miserably defaced is the face of the church? Many churches have been vacant for many years now.</p>
      <p>We are pressed by a double difficulty: we do not have suitable ministers to appoint, and even if we had them, we would lack stipends. Let me complain to you briefly here.</p>
      <p>The greater part of the common Three Leagues is evangelical; but the communities are scarcely half provided with church ministers. Many of those who are provided have employed runaway fellows who were long ago excommunicated by the synod. More of the same come daily, who stand around here and there.</p>
      <p>These, while they let themselves be hired by the communities for a small amount of money, by which they can barely ward off hunger, are accepted against the recognition of the common Three Leagues, which have decided that no one should stand unless he has been examined and admitted by a common chapter or at least by the ministers here in Chur. But if this is violated, who will punish those who are themselves lords and wish to be so? It is a beast with many heads. The communities often appeal to the rare intervention of our council; but they follow, as one unfortunately sees. Someone might say, why do they not look for other honest men over time or train young ones for this service? Answer: even if they had ministers, they have no more salary; everything is gone. You should believe me, kind sir and godfather: I write much more leniently than the matter itself is, for not everything can be safely committed to letters. Who would advise a pious, honest fellow to go there? No right-minded person, in my opinion. How can we advise honorable people to train their children for this service? What should we encourage them with? That if they did that for them, under the conditions they would have to beg one day? There are perhaps in one valley four parishes, which, if they pooled all their income together, could at most bring together 70, 80, or 90 florins.</p>
      <p>The one who hires himself to them alternates the sermons, preaching one Sunday here, the other there.</p>
      <p>But this is not to his liking either; for he must travel back and forth to the farmers, who rarely give him money, mostly cheese, eggs, cattle, and other things. And what is even worse: they hire no one for longer than a year; if in the meantime someone comes who takes 5 florins less, they take him instead, even if he is worse.</p>
      <p>As we see, it has happened with Joachim Gachlinger, who was long excommunicated by the synod, has broken his oath many times, indeed never kept it; but when it became known, he let himself be hired by the communities for 1 florin or 10 groschen cheaper that year, and so he remained.</p>
      <p>Are these things not to be deplored or are they already deplored? What more can I say? When you come to places where the churches stand empty, occasionally a minister from outside their parish jumps in, they hear him and laugh; if a priest comes after eight days, they hear and laugh again. You would say such people are of no religion.</p>
      <p>Mass and the preaching of the gospel are held with no distinction. In some churches, however, things are better, and there are more zealous men.</p>
      <p>But who are they, you ask: the nobler ones of the French faction; with them, we must maintain it as it is. Behold, to what the matter has come, etc.</p>
      <p>Many others would gladly do their best, indeed if there were hope of improvement. There are still some communities that have heard the gospel for many years, which have never been brought to remove the idols and lights from the churches.</p>
      <p>And since the benefices have been reduced and one must sometimes combine two or three, it often happens that a German and a Frenchman come together because of the border, where one must then have someone who preaches in German one Sunday in one place, in French the next in another place. But they are difficult to come by; for the Leaguers do not understand the Italians well because of the language idiom. But even if they understood them, they cannot speak German.</p>
      <p>The papists themselves are in despair about the matter; for they also see that no one is earnest or zealous. Thus, it stands badly on both sides.</p>
      <p>The evil has been removed, but the good has not been put in its place. Now it would only remain, if God would grant so much grace, that one might come to the aid of the churches from the foundation, i.e., the bishopric.</p>
      <p>But when one begins to speak about how it might be usefully applied, no one is at home, etc. If it were to make more money, everyone would want to be the first. - Here with us in Chur, things are a little better.</p>
      <p>But since this is a public cause, we also expect a public panoletria (a complete disaster). May God avert such great evils from us, which my mind foresees will happen and indeed soon. Meanwhile, you can think how variously I am affected, according to your prudence.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I am greatly distressed and tormented; yet I think, as it is, that there will always be some assembly of the church in these regions, to which I will diligently perform my duty, having been divinely called to teach. The rest, because they cannot be governed by human prudence, must be left to divine judgment. Farewell, most illustrious man, and pray to God with me that he may turn these things for the better.</p>
      <p>There is no need for you to be concerned about your son Heinrich; for those to whom you gave letters also intended to travel to Venice; it may be that they took care of your letters later. But they also had to stay in Milan for some time for reasons they indicated to me. As soon as he arrives with us, I will advise him to go straight home to you. All of ours greet you, especially Mr. Philipp, who will write himself if he receives the Bible. Give my greetings to your most honorable wife, all your children and family, furthermore to Mr. Theodor Bibliander, Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, Mr. Johann Wolph, my esteemed lords and teachers. I have not written to Mr. Collin, your father-in-law, to whom I ask you to say that we are well.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father, and forgive the rough pen. Chur, May 9, 1558.</p>
      <p>You recognize the hand of your most devoted.</p>
