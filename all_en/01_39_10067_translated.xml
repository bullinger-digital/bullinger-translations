  <input>Gratiam et vitae innocentiam a domino.

Petis a me, Berchtolde charissime, quod ipse mecum nunquam perpendi diligentius; gradus videlicet Moseos cum affinitatis tum consanguinitatis, qui cum sinuosis - mt et tu fateris - implicentur computationibus, levi manu semper perstrinxi. Soleo enim ab iis, quae sursum ac deorsum adeoque et in gyrum evolvunt mentem, libentius referre pedem, maxime si nulla me urgeat necessitas. Quanquam, ut verum fatear, supputationem hic quoque meam habeam, sed vilem quidem illam, quam et libenter commonstrabo, non tam ut te doceam quam ut a te discam; ea etenim lege communicabo tibi nostra, ut tu vicissim et tua proponas, nam expendenda produco.

Recensentur igitur hae nominatim personae Levit. 18 [6ff], quae a connubio arcere videntur certam hominum turbam. Primas tenent parentes, pater atque mater, sequitur noverca. Ab hac est soror eaque legitimo sive illegitimo thoro, a patre tantum sive a matre nata sit. Hinc sequitur nepos una cum nepte, hoc est filia filii et filia filiae, postea vero soror germana, quam Hebręus vocat filiam uxoris patris [Lev 18,11]. Sequuntur ab hac amita et matertera, hoc est patris et matris soror, item patruus, id est frater patris, una cum uxore sua, nurus quoque et fratria, denique et privigna una cum liberis suis, quibus iungitur et glos, hoc est viri soror; personae, ni fallor, in universum 15.

Sed nulli dubium plures etiam iis esse comprehensas, quas nobis contraria membra infallibili exponunt fide, cum eadem sit ratio idemque iudicium, ut etiam tu scribis, in similibus. Nam si non licet novercam ducere, certe nec vitrico nubere licet; si a sororis complexu arcetur frater, sive ea sit germana sive ex alterutro tantum parente prognata sive privigna, procul dubio nec sorori licet nubere fratri. Sic neque nepotum nobis copulari debent connubia, est autem nepos proprie filii nostri filius, neptis autem filia filiae nostrae. Hinc vero appellamus (ex lustiniani imperatoris sententia, Institut[ionum] imp[erialium] lib. 1. tit. de nuptiis) amitam patris nostri sororem, patruum fratrem et materteram matris sororem. Itaque simili ratione inter vetitas personas numeratur avunculus, id est frater matris una cum uxore sua; nam et patrui uxor prohibita est, sed idem gradus est eademque ratio patris atque matris, ergo et avunculus una cum uxore sua sunt inter prohibitas. Rursus consequitur et pari ratione prohibitos esse maritos amitae et materterae, nisi dispar sit ratio fratris et sororis; nam si coeundum non est cum uxore patrui, cur commisceretur puella cum marito amitae? Item nurus filii mei uxor est, quod si hanc ducere non possum, et gener et socer et socrus vetitae sunt personae. Est autem gener filiae meae maritus, socer uxoris pater, ut socrus uxoris mater. Iam si non commiscetur cum nuru sua pater, cur in complexum socrus admitteretur gener? Et glos mariti soror est; ei opponitur levir, mariti frater. Hic igitur et Baptista: «Non», inquit, «decet te uti, imo abuti uxore fratris» [Mk 6,18]. Proinde et fratria et sororius sub eodem continentur iugo. Sed haec fortassis obscurius; summam igitur rerum adeoque et personas plures 30 veluti in tabella oculis expono nunc contemplanda idque ad nostrae linguae usum, quo omnia sint et clariora et certiora:

Dem ledigen jüngling sind diß personen namhaft zur ehe verbotten: die muͦtter, der muͦtter schwester, deß vatters schwester, deß vatters bruder wyb, der muͦtter bruder wyb, die stieffmuͦtter, die liblich schwester von vatter und muͦtter, die schwester vom vatter allein eelich oder uneelich, das ist die stieff schwester.

Also sind der ledigen dochter diß personen zur ehe verbotten: der vatter, der muͦtter bruͦder, deß vatters bruͦder, deß vaters schwesterman, der mutter schwesterman, der stieff vatter, der liblich bruder von vatter unnd muͦtter, der bruͦder vom vatter allein oder muͦter allein, eelich oder uneelich, das ist der stieffbruͦder.

Item es sind ouch verbotten deß wybs schwöster und mans bruͦder oder bruͦders wyb unnd schwesterman.

So sind dem man verbotten diß volgend personen: deß sons dochter, der dochter dochter, die stieff dochter, der stieff dochter kind oder dochtern, deß sons wyb und die schwyger. Herwiderumb sind ouch dem wyb verbotten: deß sons son, der dochter son, der stieff son, deß stieff sons kind oder sön, der dochter man und der schwächer.</input>
  <output>You ask me, my dearest Berchtold, something I have never taken the time to consider thoroughly; namely, the degrees of affinity and consanguinity which, as you rightly admit, are entangled in intricate computations. I have always contented myself with a cursory glance at such matters, particularly if I have no pressing need to do otherwise. Although, to tell the truth, I have my own opinion on the matter, yet it is of little value, and I shall readily communicate it to you, not so much for the purpose of teaching you as of learning from you; and with this understanding I shall lay my views before you.

The following persons, then, are enumerated in Levit. 18 [6ff], as being forbidden to contract marriage: parents, father and mother; stepmother; sister, whether born in lawful or unlawful wedlock, by the father only or by the mother only. Then follows nephew, with niece, i.e. son's daughter and daughter's daughter; then sister's daughter, whom the Hebrews call father's wife's daughter [Lev 18,11]. Then follow aunt, mother's sister; uncle, father's brother, with his wife; daughter-in-law; brother's wife; and sister-in-law; and lastly, a man's concubine with her children; and sister of one's husband (or wife). In all, fifteen persons.

But, no doubt, many more are comprehended in these, as the opposite limbs of the same body bear witness to us with unfailing certainty, when the same rule and judgment prevails, as you also write, in similar cases. For if it be not lawful to marry a stepmother, of course it is not lawful to marry a stepfather; if a brother be forbidden to marry a sister, whether she be a full or half sister, or a sister-in-law, of course a sister is likewise forbidden to marry a brother. So, too, the connexion of marriage is not to be allowed between nephews and nieces, the nephew being properly the son of our son, and the niece the daughter of our daughter. Hence we call aunt the sister of our father, uncle the brother of our father, and mother's sister the mother's sister (according to the judgment of the Emperor Justinian, Institutes, book 1, title De nuptiis). Thus, by the same rule, the husbands of aunt and mother's sister must also be forbidden, unless the rule be different in the case of brother and sister; for if it be not lawful to take a wife's uncle's wife, why should a maiden be joined to the husband of her aunt? Again, the daughter-in-law is the wife of my son; if I may not take her, neither may I take my son's father-in-law, nor his mother-in-law. The son-in-law is the husband of my daughter; the father-in-law the father of my daughter's husband, and the mother-in-law the mother of my daughter's husband. And if a father may not be joined to his daughter-in-law, why should a son-in-law be joined to his mother-in-law? And the sister of a man's husband (or wife) is opposed to the brother of the same; and to him John the Baptist said, "It is not lawful for thee to have her" [Mk 6,18]. So the brother's wife and husband's sister are included under the same prohibition. But perhaps this is obscure; I therefore present the summary of the matter, and the persons comprehended in it, to the view of the eye, as in a table, now to be contemplated, and this I render into our own language, that all may be made both clearer and more certain:

The following persons are forbidden to marry an unmarried man: the mother, the mother's sister, the father's sister, the father's brother's wife, the mother's brother's wife, the stepmother, the sister-in-law (by the father or mother), the brother of the father only (legitimate or illegitimate, i.e. the stepbrother).

Likewise, the following persons are forbidden to marry an unmarried daughter: the father, the mother's brother, the father's brother, the father's sister's husband, the mother's sister's husband, the stepfather, the brother-in-law (by the father or mother), the brother of the father only (legitimate or illegitimate).

Also, it is forbidden for a man to marry his wife's sister, or his brother's wife, and for a woman to marry her husband's brother or her sister's husband.

Therefore, the following persons are forbidden to a man: his son's daughter, his daughter's daughter, his stepdaughter, the children of his stepdaughter, his son's wife, and his father-in-law. On the other hand, the following persons are forbidden to a woman: her son's son, her daughter's son, her stepson, the children of her stepson, her daughter's husband, and her mother-in-law.</output>

  <input>Haec digessimus ad hunc modum docendi et perspicuitatis gratia, non quod putem eos decere gradus liberum tantum et non virum quoque. Quod igitur discrevi, facilitatis causa discrevi, nec opus putavi ad vivum resecare et ad amussim secernere consanguinitatis gradus ab affinitate. Quis enim nescit affines esse, qui non sanguinis, sed matrimonii nexu iuncti sunt? Unde posthac quivis nullo negotio videbit, quid sub affinitatis et quid sub cognationis titulum referendum sit, estque hoc nostrum, Berchtolde mi, exiguum illud vileque de gradibus affinitatis et cognationis iudicium, ubi interim scio te longe alia expectasse. Verum cum non licet exhibere tibi, quod volumus, age, quod possumus, accipe et haec nostra boni consule.

Quod vero excommunicationem attinet, de qua nuper, quid sentirem, rogasti, ego excommunicationem nihil video esse aliud quam publicae honestatis morumque christianorum publicam et christianam custodiam, nam corda solus iudicat altissimus. Simonem enim Magum, quem in ecclesiam baptismo acceperat Philippus, non reiicit Petrus priusquam proderet impiis signis mentem impiam. Sic neque Ananias neque Saphyra neque Demas neque alii pseudochristiani ante tempus excludebantur. Et apostolus Paulus: «Quorundam», inquit, «hominum peccata ante manifesta sunt praecedentia ad iudicium, quosdam vero sequuntur, sed ista veluti πάρεργα videri poterant» [1 Tim 5, 24 f]; neminem enim aliud sentire credo quam publica eaque offendentia crimina excommunicatione esse plectenda, ubi videlicet nihil proficias admonitione fraterna, aut ubi eiusmodi designatum sit flagitium, ut impune transiri non possit, ne scilicet in malum abeat exemplum. Cuius equidem rei magna sunt inditia in 1. Pauli ad Corinth. cap. 5 [1 ff]. Hoc imprimis excutiendum videtur, apud quem sit excommunicationis authoritas et quis sit modus eius.

Scio sane plaerosque catabaptistarum misere in hac re tumultuari, quod puniendi scelerum potestas honestatisque custodia (id enim excommunicationis nomine intelligo) magistratui committitur. Mox enim horrore quodam intonant: «Si vos non audierit», inquit Christus, «dicite ecclesiae» [Mt 18,17], atque magistratus non est ecclesia. Nec vident terque quaterque prophani Christum synechdocha esse usum. Quod si negarint illi, expectabimus nos, dum illi ecclesiam convocarint, cui libellos porrigant adversum contumaces. Sed de particulari - inquiunt - ecclesia loquitur. Proinde vicimus nos Christum videlicet usum esse synechdocha, ut nunc frustra illi adhaereant literae occidenti; quid, quod mox sequitur in iisdem domini verbis? «Ubi duo vel tres in nomine meo congregati fuerint, ero in medio illorum» [Mt 18,20]. Ideoque si Christus excommunicationem particulari commisit ecclesiae (ut et ipsi fatentur) et duo aut tres, duodecim item et viginti quatuor conficiant ecclesiam particularem, quid vetat, quod Christus non item magistratui commiserit excommunicationis authoritatem, si congregetur in nomine Christi? Cur enim nos tantopere laboramus, ut non nisi e christianis deligatur congregeturque magistratus, nisi ut eius curae tuto committi possit publicae honestatis custodia? Nam et alias dei minister est authore apostolo [Röm 13,4 u. ö.], nempe ut ea, quae decora sunt, pulchra, honesta et sancta, plantet, promoveat et tueatur, contraria vero tollat.</input>
  <output>We have arranged this in this way for the sake of teaching and clarity, not because we think that only free persons should have these degrees and not men as well. So what I have distinguished is for the sake of ease, and I did not think it necessary to cut into it in detail and to precisely distinguish the degrees of kinship from affinity. For who does not know that those who are connected not by blood, but by the bond of marriage, are related by affinity? Therefore, hereafter anyone will easily see what should be referred to under the title of affinity and what under the title of kinship, and it is our small and insignificant opinion about the degrees of affinity and kinship, Berchtold my friend, though I know you had hoped for something very different. But since we are not able to give you what we would like, take what we can, and consider this our advice for the good.

As for excommunication, which you recently asked me what I thought it was, I see nothing else in excommunication than the public maintenance of honesty and Christian morals, for only the Almighty judges hearts. For Peter does not reject Simon the Magician, whom Philip had received into the church by baptism, before he reveals his impious mind with wicked signs. Therefore, neither Ananias nor Sapphira nor Demas nor other pseudo-Christians were excluded before the time. And the Apostle Paul says: “The sins of some men are obvious, going before them to judgment; and some men they follow after” [1 Tim 5, 24 f]; for I do not think anyone else thinks that crimes, which are publicly offensive, deserve to be punished by excommunication, where one is not benefiting from fraternal admonition, or where such a designated crime cannot be passed over without impunity, so that a bad example is not set. A great indication of this is found in First Paul to the Corinthians, chapter 5 [1 ff]. Above all, this should be examined, as to who has the authority of excommunication and what is the manner of it.

I know that there are many Anabaptists who are sadly tumultuous in this matter, because the power of punishing crimes and the custodianship of honesty (for this is what I understand by the name of excommunication) is committed to the magistrates. Immediately they thunder with some horror: “If he will not hear you,” says Christ, “tell it unto the church” [Mt 18,17], and the magistrates are not the church. Nor do they see three times over that Christ has used a synecdoche. But if they deny this, let us expect them to call the church, to whom they can present their bills against the contumacious. But as for the particular church - they say - Christ speaks. Therefore we have overcome, since it is plain that Christ has used a synecdoche, so that they now adhere in vain to the letter; what more, that which follows immediately in the same words of the Lord? “Where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them” [Mt 18,20]. Therefore, if Christ has committed excommunication to the particular church (as they themselves confess) and two or three, twelve and twenty-four make a particular church, what forbids that, which Christ has not likewise committed to the magistrates, when it is gathered in the name of Christ? For why do we struggle so much that the magistrates are not chosen and gathered from among non-Christians, except that the custodianship of public honesty can be safely committed to him? For he is also the minister of God, according to the author of the Apostle [Röm 13,4 u. ö.], namely to plant, promote and protect those things that are becoming, beautiful, honorable and holy, and to remove the contrary.</output>

  <input>Quid, quod integrior ac maior erit penes magistratum excommunicationis authoritas quam apud promiscuam plebem, quae, ut iudicio caret, sic affectibus plaerunque ducitur? Neque vero et omnes sumus christiani, qui interim in ecclesia Christi recensemur ferimusque suffragia. Quid itaque agas apud eos calculorum suffragiis, quos idem morbus tenet, quem tu cupias extinctum? Si ergo nunc de eius, qui peccavit, exclusione aut mulcta quaeras, verebitur hic ne eodem iuguletur laqueo, quem illi necteret, pulchre itaque dissimulabit appellabitque misericordiam, aut tumultu excitato comitiis ac vaframentis ecclesiam infecta re dissolvet. Videmus enim quotidie, quo res nostrae decidant, si unus atque alter protrahatur, ut pristina vita posita meliorem vivat, fuitque id ab omnibus seculis certo observatum optima quaeque a minima semper populi parte suscepta esse, at inter paucos eosque selectos floruisse honestatem. Quid enim, si unus atque alter ex magistratibus degeneret aut in transversum subdola agat consilia? Deponatur etenim e fastigio et surrogetur in eius locum syncerior, id, quod in promiscua plebe fieri non potest. Huc facit, quod Exod. 12 [3] legimus dominum praecepisse Mosi et Aharon: «Loquimini ad universum coetum filiorum Israel»; et paulo post, ubi hoc domini mandatum scribit impletum: «Vocavit», inquit, «Moses omnes seniores filiorum Israel» [12, 21]. Unde liquido claret et ecclesiam non impie usurpari pro certa hominum turba; ex quibus omnibus illud consequitur excommunicationis authoritatem sancto senatui non per rapinam (ut quidam aiunt), sed pie deferri. Patrocinatur istis quidem nostris vetustissimus ille et longe eruditissimus Tertullianus, qui in «Apologetico» adversus gentes cap. 39 de christiana disciplina verba faciens: «Coimus», inquit, «ad divinarum literarum commemorationem, si quid praesentium temporum qualitas aut praemonere cogit aut recognoscere. Certe fidem sanctis vocibus pascimus, spem erigimus, fiduciam figimus, disciplinam praeceptorum nihilominus inculcationibus densamus. Ibidem etiam exhortationes, castigationes et censura divina. Nam et iudicatur magno cum pondere, ut apud certos de conspectu dei, summumque futuri iudicii praeiudicium est, si quis ita deliquerit, ut a communicatione orationis et conventus et omnis sancti commercii relegetur. Praesident probati quique seniores, honorem istum non pretio, sed testimonio adepti. Neque enim precio ulla res dei constat» etc. Quibus Tertulliani verbis liquido claret excommunicandi authorita[te]m eo tempore, hoc est in primitiva ecclesia, fuisse apud certos vita, moribus pietateque insignes viros, non apud promiscuam ecclesiae turbam.

Verum ita, dicis, evicerunt pontificii; affirmant enim consiliorum suorum statuta ecclesiae esse statuta. «Ubi enim duo vel tres conveniunt» [Mt 18,20], ibi ecclesia. Convenere autem non raro trecenti ac quadringenti episcopi, fuerunt ergo ecclesia dei. Iam «si quis ecclesiam non audierit, sit tibi», inquit dominus, «tanquam ethnicus et publicanus» [Mt 18,17]. Sed falluntur, nam ut nunc sileam non omnem coetum esse sanctum, nec nostram ecclesiam, cuius Christus meminit in Math. [18,20] coire, ut sanctiones adversus scripturas sanciat; vera enim dei ecclesia vocem pastoris solam audit et agnoscit. Clarissime edixit Christus: «si convenerint in nomine meo» [Mt 18,20]; porro illi convenere «in nomine proprio» (ut Ioan. 5 [43] ait Christus), ergo non convenere in nomine Christi.

Testamur hac in re pontificum decreta. Quod vero episcopus sibi soli sumpsit excommunicationis authoritatem, eaque tyrannidem suam exercuit ac vindicavit, impudentius est quam quod responsionem mereatur. Sed haec obiter.</input>
  <output>What then, that the authority of excommunication will be more complete and greater with magistrates than with the general populace who, lacking judgment, is often guided by their feelings? And not all of us who are counted and cast our votes in the Church of Christ are Christians. So what can you do with those who vote by counting stones, whom the same disease holds, which you wish to be extinguished? If you now seek the exclusion or punishment of one who has sinned, he will be afraid that he will be strangled by the same noose that he would tie on him. He will therefore cunningly disguise himself and call it mercy, or, with a tumult raised, he will dissolve the church infected with fraud in the elections and confusion. For we see every day how our affairs decline if one or two are drawn out, so that they may live a better life than their former one, and it has been observed by all ages that the best things have always been adopted by the smallest part of the people, and that among a few and selected ones, integrity has flourished. For what if one or two magistrates degenerate or act with cunning in a cross-wise way? Let him be deposed from his place of honor and let one more sincere be substituted in his place, which cannot be done in the general populace. This is what Exodus 12:3 tells us that the Lord commanded Moses and Aaron: "Speak to all the assembly of the children of Israel"; and a little later, when the Lord's command is written, he says: "Moses called all the elders of the children of Israel" [12:21]. From this it is clearly evident that the Church is not usurped for a certain crowd of people; from all this it follows that the authority of excommunication is not stolen (as some say) from the holy senate, but is piously handed over to them. Tertullian, the most ancient and very learned, supports us in this, who, in his Apology against the Gentiles, chapter 39, speaking about Christian discipline, said: "We come together for the commemoration of divine scriptures, if the quality of present times forces us to admonish or recognize. We certainly feed our faith with holy words, raise up hope, establish trust, and with frequent teachings we also densify the discipline of precepts. There is also exhortation, correction and divine censorship. For it is judged with great weight, so that in the presence of God, the supreme judgment of the future is the exclusion of prayer, assembly, and all holy commerce, if someone has sinned so much. The elders who have been tested preside over this honor, not for money, but for testimony. Indeed, no divine thing is for sale "etc. From Tertullian's words it is clearly evident that at that time, that is, in the primitive Church, the authority of excommunication was with certain men distinguished by their life, morals and piety, not with the general crowd of the Church.

But, as you say, the pontiffs have prevailed in this matter; they claim that the statutes of their councils are the statutes of the Church. "For where two or three are gathered together in my name" [Mt 18:20], there is the Church. However, three hundred and four hundred bishops have rarely gathered, so there was the Church of God. Now, "if anyone does not listen to the Church, let him be to you as a heathen and a publican" [Mt 18:17]. But they are mistaken, for, to pass by now that not every gathering is holy, nor is our Church, of which Christ speaks in Math. [18:20], to come together in order to pass sanctions against the Scriptures; for the true Church of God only hears and recognizes the voice of the pastor. Christ has declared most clearly: "if they shall be gathered together in my name" [Mt 18:20]; on the other hand, they gathered together "in their own name" (as Christ said in John 5 [43]), so they did not gather together in the name of Christ.

We testify in this matter to the decrees of the pontiffs. But that the bishop has taken the authority of excommunication to himself alone, and has exercised and vindicated his tyranny, is more impudent than one that deserves a response. But this incidentally.</output>

  <input>Restat, ut de excommunicationis modo disseramus, quanquam non videam, quid post Christum copiosius aut venus adferri possit; is enim gradibus quibusdam locatis: «Si», inquit, «peccaverit in te frater tuus» [Mt 18,15] et quae sequuntur, nam notus alias locus, qui docet post admonitiones fraternas contumaci nequicquam inculcatas infligendam esse exclusionem, ut inquam is poenam sceleris et contemptus luat, qui admonitiones fraternas contempserat. Sed Christus (inquiunt) «si», ait, «te non audierit, sit tibi veluti ethnicus et publicanus» [Mt 18,17] et Paulus inquit «tradatur satanae» [1 Kor 5,5], non dicit: tradatur magistratui ad poenam. Quibus respondemus Christum quidem istis omnibus nihil aliud voluisse quam eum publice mulctandum esse, qui spretis commonitionibus amicis inhoneste perrexerit vivere. Esse enim ethnicum et publicanum est recenseri haberique inter facinorosos, quibus nihil neque officii neque synceri tuto committere ausis; ut nos solemus moechos, ebrios aliosque palam flagitiosos honore et trabea exutos publice dedecorare; porro hoc quid aliud est quam publica mulcta? Sic etiam fatemur Paulum scripsisse «tradatur satanae», sed eundem quoque addidisse: «ad interitum carnis» [1 Kor 5,5]; unde necessario consequitur non modo Christum ipsum, sed apostolum quoque non de aliqua animae interna loqui perditione, sed de externo quodam ritu adeoque et externa mulcta. Nam in 2. ad Corinth. 2. cap. [6]: «Sufficit», ait, «istiusmodi homini ἡ ἐπιτιμία αὕτη», hoc est mulcta sive correctio ea; nam «τιμᾶν και τιμᾶσθαι», authore Budaeo «utrunque dicitur pro eo, quod est mulctare et in aliquem animadvertere», et τίμισις [!] est supplicii aestimatio et animadversionis modus. Rursus «ἐπιτιμῶ», eodem authore, «significat reprehendo» et ἐπιτιμᾶσθαι est censum agere et aestimare. «Ἄτιμοι quoque infamia notati dicuntur» et qui «velut fortunis omnibus eversi», ut apud Demosthenem est, «civilia iura retinere non poterant». «Licebat igitur ἀτίμους impune interficere, ut praesidii legum exortes»; «quibus similes fuere, quos Latini prisci intestabiles vocarunt, ut Horatius: «intestabilis et sacer esto»» et «Caius iureconsultus: «Cum lege», inquit, «quis intestabilis esse iubetur, eo pertinet ne eius testimonium recipiatur»» etc. Breviter, videmus iam Paulum usum esse ἐπιτιμία pro ἀτιμίa, hoc est mulcta hancque unam sufficere vult. Sufficiat itaque et nostris facinorosis magistratus - hoc est ecclesiae - mulcta pro sceleris ratione praefinita.

Atque hic sit ille noster excommunicationis modus, ut scilicet initio per familiarem amice moneatur peccator, deinde per unum atque alterum, ut rem videat geri seriam. Hos si contempserit, vocetur ac sistatur ecclesiae, hoc est magistratui et excommunicationi praefectis, quod si et hos neglexerit, poenam dependat. Atque hoc sit, iuxta domini verbum, modus et finis excommunicationis: mulcta inquam indicta et depensa, ut ne quid nimis, sicut et Paulus sentit. At nimium velle videntur, qui iubent, ut magistratus puniat flagitium idemque et ab excommunicationis praesidibus puniatur nihilominus interdictione videlicet coenae. Ideoque qui nunc putant nullibi excommunicationem esse posse, ubi non arceantur a sacra synaxi peccatores, plus severi esse videntur minusque observare, quis excommunicationis et quis sit eucharistiae genius. Etenim excommunicatio propter malum exemplum est, ne illud impune porro grassetur, proinde posteaquam illud punitum est ac coercitum, defuncta est munere suo, nec latius diffunditur. Eucharistia vero propter peccatores est; iam si ab ea secludantur solique admittantur puri, pro quibus, oro, effusus est sanguis Christi? An non pro peccatis effusus est? Si ergo arceatur peccator, qui interim contumax non est, frustra effudit sanguinem Iesus. «Neque enim qui recte valent, medico indigent» [Mt 9,12]. Quid, quod ipsa eucharistia cum consolatione coniuncta est, annunciatur enim gratuita peccatorum remissio. Sed excommunicatio plus terroris habet, puniuntur enim peccata non equidem ad purificationem vel satisfactionem, ut scilicet tuto liceat postea accumbere mensae dominicae, sed propulsandum malum exemplum. Seperanda [!] ergo altera ab altera, ut singulae genuinum servent genium. Huic vero nos satisfactum esse censemus, posteaquam facinorosus publice mulctatus atque coram ecclesia (ut sic dicam) confusus est. Post inflictam vero poenam et manumissum arbitramur synaxim illi liberam esse debere atque arbitrio fidei committendum cuiusvis, accedere malit, an abstinere. Neque vero misero in poenam et adflictionem vertendum esse, quod Christus instituerat ad consolationem et medelam.</input>
  <output>Let us now discuss the manner of excommunication, although I do not see what more could be offered after Christ. He has set out a certain order: "If your brother sins against you" [Mt 18:15] and the following verses, for the passage is well-known, teaching that after fraternal warnings have been in vain imposed on the contumacious, exclusion should be imposed as punishment for the sin and contempt. But (they say) Christ says "if he will not hear thee, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican" [Mt 18:17], and Paul says "deliver him unto Satan" [1 Cor 5:5], he does not say deliver him to the magistrate for punishment. To which we reply that Christ meant nothing else by these words than that he should be publicly fined who, despising the warnings of his friends, shall go on living dishonestly. For to be an heathen man and a publican is to be reckoned among malefactors, who may safely entrust nothing to either duty or sincerity; as we are in the habit of publicly disgracing adulterers, drunkards, and other manifestly flagitious persons, deprived of honour and insignia. What else is this but a public fine? We also admit that Paul wrote "deliver him unto Satan", but the same also added "for the destruction of the flesh" [1 Cor 5:5]; whence it necessarily follows that both Christ himself and the Apostle spoke not of some internal destruction of the soul, but of some external rite, and consequently of some external fine. For in 2 Cor. 2 [6], he says "this punishment is enough for such a one," that is to say, a fine or correction. For "τιμᾶν και τιμᾶσθαι", according to Budaeus, "both signify to fine and to punish"; and τίμισις is the estimation and manner of punishment or chastisement. Again, according to the same author, "ἐπιτιμὼ signifies I reprehend," and ἐπιτιμάσθαι is to impose a tax or fine. "Men also branded with infamy are called ἄτιμοι," and who, "as if overturned in all their fortunes," as in Demosthenes, "could not retain the rights of citizens"; "it was therefore lawful to slay ἀτίμους unpunished, that the authority of the laws might be maintained"; "to whom the ancients resembled those whom they called intestabiles, as Horace: ‘be thou intestabilis and sacred’" and "the jurist Caius: ‘When anyone is by law declared intestabilis,’ says he, ‘it is meant that his testimony should not be received’" etc. In short, we see that Paul had already used ἐπιτιμία for ἀτιμία, that is to say, a fine, and that he thought this one enough. Let it therefore suffice for our malefactors also, the magistrate, that is to say, the Church, with a fine determined by a due consideration of the offence.

And let this be our manner of excommunication, that at first the sinner should be admonished by a friend, then by one and another, that the matter may be seen to be taken seriously; if he despises these, let him be called before and stand before the Church, that is to say, the magistrate and presidents of excommunication; and if he neglects these also, let the punishment ensue. And this, according to the word of the Lord, let be the manner and end of excommunication, a fine indeed imposed and exacted, so that nothing be done beyond what is fit, according to Paul's opinion. But they seem to be too severe who command that the magistrate should punish the flagitious and that he should likewise be punished by the presidents of excommunication, with interdict of the supper. Therefore they who now think that there can be no excommunication where offenders are not excluded from sacred communion, appear to be too severe and to observe too little what is the genius of excommunication and what is that of the eucharist. For excommunication is for a bad example, lest it spread further unpunished; therefore when it is punished and restrained, it has done its office, nor does it spread any further. But the eucharist is for sinners; now if they are excluded and only the pure admitted, for whom, I ask, was the blood of Christ shed? Was it not for sins? If then the sinner, who is not meanwhile contumacious, be excluded, in vain did Jesus shed his blood. "For they that be whole need not a physician" [Mt 9:12]. What, that the eucharist is joined with consolation; for the remission of sins is announced gratuitously. But excommunication has more of terror, for sins are punished, not indeed for purification or satisfaction, that it may be safe to sit down afterwards at the Lord's table, but to repel the bad example. Let the two therefore be kept separate, that each may retain its genuine genius. To this we judge that satisfaction is given, when the malefactor is publicly fined and before the Church (so to speak) put to shame. But after the punishment is inflicted and he is set at liberty, we think that the synaxis ought to be free to him and left to the faith of each, whether he will choose to come or abstain. Nor ought his misery to be converted into punishment and affliction, what Christ instituted for consolation and remedy.</output>

  <input>Verum cur, inquiunt, admitteretur prophanus? Atqui prophanationis poenas dependit, iam vero iudicio dei stat, non nostro, nostro enim satisfecit. Vis autem tu, o homo, qui alienum servum sic iudicas [Röm 14,4], et fidem eius iudicare? Nescis fidem non satisfactionis esse meritum, sed dei donum? [Eph 2,8]. Et quod dominus docet: «Si peccaverit in te frater tuus, increpa illum, et si pęnituerit, remitte illi. Et si septies in die peccaverit in te, et si septies in die conversus fuerit ad te dicens «poenitet me», remittes illi» [Lk 17,3f]. Quae, oro, intervalla, aut quot, obsecro, annos (ut Nicena olim synodus) praefixit salvator Matheo, Magdalenae, Zacheo - quemadmodum alias disputavimus adversus catabaptistas - et eucharistia quid aliud est quam publica credentium panegyris? Accedunt enim, qui se Christi sanguine ablutos credunt et liberatori gratias agere volunt. Quis ergo prohibebit etiam eum a synaxi, qui iam iam mulctatus ob patratum flagitium participare mensae domini desyderat, fidit enim Christo et gratias agit? An vero nemo fidit Christo, nisi prius aliquot septimanis egerit poenitentiam? Ubi ergo nunc evangelii praedicatio, ubi nunc filius ille prodigus, latro item crucis interpres, sed et publicanus ille pharisaeo collatus, imo et praelatus, ipse denique Zachaeus, Magdalene et Matheus? Proinde excommunicatio eucharistiae misceri non debet neque vero et is a sacra arceri mensa, qui aut publici criminis, imo perduellionis, contemptus, contumaciae et pertinaciae (quanquam is alias non cupiat huius coenae esse conviva) nondum convictus aut etiam convictus ac mulctatus est. Mulcta enim illi fuit excommunicatio, sed eucharistia per fidem illi posthac stat libera. Eadem fere ante nos summi iudicii purissimaeque religionis vir Zuinglius scripsit in «Amica ad Marthinum Lutherum exegesi» pag. 150: «Unde et qui Tiguri sumus fratres» etc.

Quod vero alii (ne illud forte sileatur) excommunicationis vocem obiiciunt, quasi illa excommunicatio et criminum correctio dici non possit, quae non item et a sacra arceat synaxi: quippe excommunicatio dicitur, inquiunt, quasi privatio communionis, hoc est coenae dominicae, quae sane apud vos esse non potest, qui mulcta magistratus estis contenti. Quod, inquam, ista proferunt, frustra proferunt. Fuit enim excommunicationis vox veteribus in usu, quam interim in sacris haud facile invenias. Illi ergo, ut Bernae primi docuistis verissime, vivebant inter eos, qui publica etiam crimina nulla perstringebant censura, cum interim ipsis neminem mulctare permittebatur, utpote apud quos nulla erat gladii potestas. Alia ergo tentandum [!] via, cum hac succedere negatum esset, quo scilicet nihilominus publicae consuleretur honestati. Hic igitur istis visa est eucharistiae et orationis publica interdictio commodissima esse via, quae ad publicam duceret honestatem et qua exportarentur ex sancto fidelium coetu contagione mortifera peccata. Idcirco suam illam criminum propulsatricem conservatricemque publicae honestatis dixere excommunicationem.

Neque enim ullibi ipse dominus docuit flagitia interdictione coenae esse punienda atque abolenda, qui ipsum etiam Iudam a coena non exclusit; nam etsi Hilarius proditorem excludat, evangelistae tamen non excludunt, sed adseverant Christum una accubuisse cum duodecim, et Ioannes omnium apertissime: «Et coena facta», ait, «cum diabolus iam» etc. [Joh 13,2]. Nobiscum sentit et Augustinus. Ergo Iudam etsi maxime monuerit, tamen a coena non exclusit; quin imo certo constat neque ipsos domini apostolos fractione panis sic usos. Nam Paulus in Corinthiis: «Quotiescunque», inquit, «commederitis panem hunc et de poculo hoc biberitis, mortem domini annunciabitis, donec venerit» [1 Kor 11,26]. Quibus verbis nullum hominum genus segregat, sed omnibus ex aequo proponit crucem domini, ut inquam morti eius fidant et gratias agant. Liberam itaque reliquit esseque voluit coenae festivitatem. Multo enim clarius subiungit: «Iam vero si quis indigne ederit hunc panem pretiosum aut peculiarem», id enim possunt graecanica praemodum ἐμφατικῶς: «τὸν ἄρτον τοῦτον», «et biberit de poculo domini», en hic «poculum domini» vocat, non «poculum istud»; «τοῦτον» ergo in priori membro posuit ἐμφατικῶς, «indigne, reus erit corporis et sanguinis domini», «τοῦ κυρίου» cum articulo, ut intelligamus corpus et sanguinem, non utique panis et vini transubstantiati [!], sed illius domini, qui in cruce pependerat; nam relationis naturam habet ad aliud. «Probet autem seipsum homo et sic de pane edat et poculo bibat» [1 Kor 11,27f]. En tibi clarissimam habes apostoli sententiam non eam quidem esse eucharistiam, quae pro cuiusvis libito prohiberi aut etiam offerri possit alicui, sed quae cuiusvis arbitrio et probationi relinquitur. Quod enim obiici poterat ex 10. cap.: «Non potestis participare mensae domini et mensae daemoniorum» [1 Kor 10,21], adversus nostra non pugnat, sed et alterius sunt instituti ac status, ut ipse nosti. Sed haec hactenus.</input>
  <output>Why then, they say, should the impure be allowed? But the punishment of impurity depends on the judgment of God, not ours, for ours has been satisfied by Him. Do you then, O man, who judge another's servant [Rom 14:4], and judge his faith, not know that faith is not of works, but a gift of God [Eph 2:8]? And what does the Lord teach: "If your brother sins against you, rebuke him; and if he repents, forgive him. And if he sins against you seven times in the day, and seven times in the day turns to you saying, 'I repent,' you shall forgive him" [Lk 17:3f]? What intervals, I beseech you, or how many years (as the Council of Nice once did) has the Savior prescribed for Matthew, Mary Magdalene, and Zacchaeus - as we have elsewhere disputed against the Anabaptists - and what else is the Eucharist but the public panegyric of the believers? For they come who believe they are cleansed with Christ's blood and wish to give thanks to the Deliverer. Who then will forbid him from the synaxis, who, having already been punished for the committed crime, desires to participate in the Lord's table, for he believes in Christ and gives thanks? Or does no one believe in Christ until he has served a few weeks in penance? Where then is the preaching of the Gospel, where now the prodigal son, the robber also interpreter of the cross, and the publican compared to the Pharisee, and even the prelate, and indeed Zacchaeus, Mary Magdalene, and Matthew? Therefore excommunication should not be mixed with the Eucharist, nor should one be excluded from the sacred table who has not yet been convicted or even convicted and punished for public crime, contempt, contumacy, and stubbornness (although he may not wish to be a guest of this supper). For excommunication was his punishment, but the Eucharist is free to him through faith from now on. The same thing was almost written before us by the most pure religious man Zwingli in his "Friendly Exegesis to Martin Luther" on page 150: "And so those of us who are in Zurich, brothers" etc.

But what others (so that it should not be left unspoken) object to the word excommunication, as if excommunication and correction of crimes can not be said which does not also exclude from the sacred synaxis: for, they say, excommunication is called as if it were a deprivation of communion, that is, of the Lord's supper, which can certainly not be among you, who are content with the punishment of the magistrate. What, I say, they propose is in vain. For the word excommunication was in use among the ancients, which meanwhile you can hardly find in the sacred ones. So those, as you have most truly taught in Berna, lived among those who did not punish public crimes with any censure, although they were not allowed to punish anyone, since there was no power of the sword among them. So another way had to be tried [!], since this had been refused, whereby nevertheless public decency would be consulted. Therefore, to these, the prohibition of the Eucharist and prayer seemed to be the most convenient way to lead to public decency and to export deadly sins from the holy assembly of the faithful. Therefore they called their crime-driving and preserving public decency excommunication.

For nowhere did the Lord himself teach that crimes should be punished and abolished by the interdiction of the supper, who did not exclude even Judas from the supper; for although Hilary reports the traitor to be excluded, the evangelists do not exclude him, but affirm that Christ sat down with the twelve, and John most openly: "And supper being ended," he says, "when the devil had already" etc. [Jn 13:2]. Augustine also agrees with us. Therefore, although he had most severely warned him, he did not exclude him from the supper; nay, it is certain that even the Lord's apostles did not use the breaking of bread in this way. For Paul in the Corinthians: "As often as," he says, "you eat this bread and drink this cup, you proclaim the death of the Lord until he comes" [1 Cor 11:26]. With these words he does not separate any kind of people, but offers to all equally the cross of the Lord, so that they may trust in his death and give thanks. Therefore he left the festival of the supper free and wished it to be so. For he adds much more clearly: "But let a man prove himself, and so let him eat of this bread and drink of this cup" [1 Cor 11:27f]. Here you have the clearest sentence of the apostle, that the Eucharist is not such that it can be prohibited or even offered to anyone at will, but that it is left to everyone's discretion and proof. For what could be objected from the 10th chapter: "You cannot partake of the Lord's table and the table of demons" [1 Cor 10:21], does not fight against our views, but they belong to different institutions and statuses, as you know yourself. But this is enough.</output>

  <output>My dear Berchtold, before we part, consider briefly with me what fruit this practice of the Eucharist and the old mode of excommunication, that is, the mixture of synaxeos and epitimeseos, have brought us. From it sprang forth our blasphemous satisfaction, various rites and stations in churches or temples appointed for penitents according to the intervals of time, and all that theatrical hypocrisy, of which if you desire more details, you will find them in Ruffinus' "Ecclesiastical History" book 10, chapter 6, and again in Sozomenus in Epiphanio's "Tripartite History" book 9, chapter 36. Therefore, if we have also made a joyous panegyric of a certain terrible whip of correction, let us beware lest the joyous fruit of the Eucharist, the joy and congratulations, convert into some pontifical torture and that penitential satisfaction return by postliminium, or even the confidence of works, as we see was done by the ancients, who, however, certainly did not begin with the intention that it should come to this. Meanwhile we shall not prejudice anyone, my dearest Berchtold, and this we especially wish you to bear witness to, for I, being learned, shall willingly yield to better things. This is my opinion concerning excommunication, which I have now fully set forth at your request, partly to gratify you, partly that you may tell me what you think, for already we await your reply.

Farewell, and give my most hearty regards to our Gasper Megander, Francis, Rhellican, and Heinrich Simler.

Bremgarti, 6th July 1531.

Your Heinrych Bullinger, as you are mine.</output>
