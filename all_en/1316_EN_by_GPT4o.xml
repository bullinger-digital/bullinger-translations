      <p>Greetings. For a long time, I have not written to you because I have been very busy throughout the year with many and great labors, which I will soon complete by the grace of God and will not impose upon myself such great labors to be completed by my hand alone. If you are delighted by the knowledge of my language, I will send to you everything that is published here, partly in sacred and partly in secular writings. Meanwhile, however, although I have been attached to this most troublesome mill, I have not so forgotten our old and sincere friendship that I have not frequently sent my greetings to you through those who were traveling to Zürich.</p>
      <p>I also received your greeting combined with a reproach through the students from Wittenberg, which was very pleasing to me, and I did not take it so badly to be accused by you of negligence, as it was pleasing and delightful to be asked for the duty of writing, in which, God willing, I will not fail your wish, as soon as I begin to breathe again. Meanwhile, when Augustinus was traveling to you, I did not want him to come to you without my letters.</p>
      <p>He wishes to recover his belongings, which he says he has there, so that they are not seized by his wife, who fled from here, having robbed her husband of money and household goods; she has shown herself here to be such that I think this poor man can live much more happily without her than with her; if you help him, you will do a work pleasing to God. I have nothing new to write to you. Recently, there was a widespread rumor here that the Emperor was going to the Netherlands; now there is no longer any mention of the departure. Regarding the war that has arisen in Italy, I think you can have more certain information there than I can write. I believe the territory of Parma will be to the French what Bologna was to the English; indeed, a great ruin and disturbance will follow throughout Europe, and in the meantime, the Turk will not rest, who already has a fleet of two hundred well-equipped galleys ready. And who doubts that these are now the last and unfortunate times, which the Son of God foretold would come long ago? I have received frequent letters from Philipp Melanchthon, in all of which he promises to come here as soon as he can free himself from the courtly shackles that hold him back in the deliberations of the council in Trient. The people of Magdeburg are besieged more closely today than ever before, and the number of soldiers flocking to Maurice's camp is growing; but the besieged resist bravely and seem determined to remain unbroken in spirit, unless they are deprived of supplies, which I do not believe. You could have recently learned this from the messenger from Wittenberg, who set out from my house to you, through whom I could not write to you. Freed from my troublesome labors, I will write to you more frequently and abundantly, which I ask you to do the same. Farewell with your whole family.</p>
      <p>Carefully greet on my behalf Lord Pellican, Lord Gesner, Theodor, and the other old friends, especially Lord Gwalter. Strasbourg, June 22, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Francis Dryander.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful minister of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
