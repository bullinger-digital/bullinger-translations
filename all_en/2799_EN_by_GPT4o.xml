      <p>Greetings. The distinguished man and our dear brother, Mr. Franz Lysmanninus, has informed us that he received a letter from you, most honorable man, written in your name, as well as in the name of your fellow students and nobles. In this letter, among other things, you request faithful advice on how you might retain and further propagate the evangelical truth of Christ in the Polish churches, and also how to defend against those who, with new opinions, either previously condemned or newly devised, disturb the churches. We will gladly share our counsel in this matter out of Christian charity, provided you receive it with pious fairness.</p>
      <p>First and foremost, it seems to us that those who strive to retain and then extend the evangelical truth of Christ in the churches should ensure that they themselves have properly established and reformed churches. For if this is not taken care of, that reformation will be unstable, and seeds of error and contention will be spread to other churches. Unless doctrine and the use of sacraments are legitimately established according to the rule of God's word, contentious minds will always have something to attack, and the pious and truly learned will not approve of a mixture concocted from many sources. Civil people are strangely pleased to limp on both sides; they hate complete religion and pure reformation in religion. For they fear the seditions they expect to arise from the abolition of accepted religions, and the recall of simple and sincere doctrine. Therefore, they think to weave a certain convenient mixture of religion from the gospel of Christ and the doctrine of the antichrist, which is not entirely opposed to either party, both Christians and antichristians, and therefore cannot be completely disapproved. And to these we owe the variety and diversity that we see too much at odds in so many churches. But what does the word of the Lord judge about this mixture? Read Ezekiel chapter 13: Once the priests of Israel also wanted to combine the God of Israel and Baal, Judaism and paganism. But against these, the prophet Elijah cries out, thundering, and says: "How long will you limp on both sides? If the Lord is God, follow him; if Baal is God, follow him." And the words of the prophets do not at all approve of the kings who indeed reformed the churches and removed many impieties, but left the high places untouched. Our Lord Jesus Christ expressly forbids sewing a new patch on an old garment and putting old wine into new wineskins. He also spits out the lukewarm from his mouth, who are neither hot nor cold.</p>
      <p>The Nazarenes or Minaeans, converted from Pharisaism to the gospel, also wanted to mix legal things with the gospel. But the most holy and learned apostle of Christ, Paul, opposes them in all his letters. They themselves were condemned in the council of Jerusalem, with a synodical letter written against them, which St. Luke recites in Acts chapter 15. There are also examples testifying that such a mixture has always been harmful to the church of God and has given birth to endless contentions. Muhammad, that most wicked and unfortunate Arab, concocted a pestilent religion from Judaism, paganism, and Christianity, and finally from various heresies, and thus planted eternal evil in the world. In our memory, a certain interdict, called the Interim, was produced, itself composed of both corrupt and pure elements.</p>
      <p>But what did it produce? These things are more well-known than to need recounting by us. Therefore, all these things teach us to reform the churches to the living and to flee all kinds of mixtures as most pernicious and also abominable to God.</p>
      <p>Let the canonical scripture provide the perfect and God-pleasing form for reformation; for this alone is most perfect. The apostle testifies about this and says: "All scripture is divinely inspired and useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, thoroughly equipped for every good work." And he adds.</p>
      <p>"You, therefore, continue in the things which you have learned and been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned them, and that from childhood you have known the holy scriptures, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus." You recognize the place of the apostle transcribed from 2 Timothy chapter 3. To which he appends a serious exhortation in chapter 4, that he persist in these things and progress legitimately, because in the last times some will turn their ears away from the sincere truth and turn to human fables.</p>
      <p>Therefore, whatever seems to pertain to the establishment of the church and the integrity of sound doctrine, to the institution of ministers, to rightful invocation and prayers, to the proper celebration of rites and sacraments, to the correction of morals, and to other necessary things of this kind, let all these, I say, be sought from the scriptures. Nor should divine simplicity and frugality displease us here. Divine things are different from human things; human superstition admires nothing unless it shines with worldly pomp: hence so many noble paintings, so many ornaments, as they call them; the display of gems, the abundance of gold and silver has prevailed in the temples of Christians. But the old apostolic church was ignorant of this, which had very few ceremonies; yet it was most opulent in the proclamation of God's word, in constant prayers, and in the amendment and purity of life. Where there is an abundance of ceremonies, there those things which ought to be most ample are thrust into a narrow space. Let this admonition suffice; for we do not prescribe laws nor establish a full discussion on these matters.</p>
      <p>For the preservation of purer doctrine, it will be of no small benefit if you have diligently considered the doctrines of the ancient heretics against divine scripture and apostolic doctrine, once spread by the Valentinians, Manichaeans, Patripassians, Novatians, Sabellians, Arians, Macedonians, Nestorians, Eutychians, Donatists, Pelagians, Messalians, and other such pestiferous sects. For we absolutely think that these should be avoided and not allowed, so that men of ill will and not confirmed in faith do not revive heresies once buried. Therefore, if any arise who begin to spread blasphemies, let them be called to a conference and refuted with scriptures, admonished, and restrained.</p>
      <p>For the peace of the churches and the confirmation of evangelical truth, it will also be of no small benefit if you cut off all occasion for curious disputes and subtle questions, but which contribute nothing to piety. Rather, take care of those things which pertain to salvation, that we may rightly and sincerely believe in God, that we may sincerely understand the mystery of redemption, and perform the duties of the saints, exercising ourselves in these, desiring to be and to be seen as better rather than more learned. The apostle Paul does not admonish us lightly to beware of questions and disputes; for where these are admitted and received, ambition, envy, the desire to win, vain glory, revenge, and all disturbances insinuate themselves; for they often set even the closest friends against each other.</p>
      <p>Especially, however, the institution of schools will contribute to the preservation and propagation of evangelical truth. This is an old institution, which ecclesiastical history indicates has lasted from the times of the apostles. Nor is there any doubt that the corruption of schools gave rise to collegiate churches and many certainly older monasteries. Therefore, true piety and just restitution should command that they be converted back into schools. We speak here of a Christian and ecclesiastical school, not a philosophical or Antiochian or ethnic one. There are today great vices in the schools even among reformed churches, which we do not wish to pursue now.</p>
      <p>Having established some schools, it will be your primary concern to ensure that there are in them pious, sincerely and truly learned teachers and instructors, most alien to contentions and innovations, hardworking, modest, venerable in purity of life, and grave in authority, who do not declaim for applause and to gain a reputation for rare learning, but accommodate themselves to their listeners, teach useful and necessary things, and require the progress of their students.</p>
      <p>Let them teach languages and arts, indeed soberly and as much as is sufficient, always remembering that they are not forming or shaping a Platonic or Aristotelian, finally some sceptical philosopher, but a servant of Christ, who will someday serve the Christian school or church. Therefore, there will be a need for theological lectures as well. We do not wish here to dull minds with summaries, as was once customary in theological schools, where the summary of Lombard was lectured. We advise all sincere students of theology to be rightly led to evangelical and apostolic reading, then also prophetic, in which the very context will supply the theologian with necessary commonplaces. Here we do not condemn the writings of earlier men, who labored in illustrating this kind and in expounding the scriptures. We confess that they deserve praise and we commend their diligence. However, for the formation of a theologian, we prefer to propose the pure word of God itself.</p>
      <p>Teachers know how to use the work of interpreters, and here we especially warn that luxuriant minds should not be allowed to have nothing certain and wander, indeed roam through everything.</p>
      <p>For it is necessary for him who wishes to study with some fruit and learn good letters to have a certain goal to which he refers all his studies. Hence, let our ecclesiastical student have piety and the governance of churches and the purity of ecclesiastical doctrine as his goal.</p>
      <p>We say nothing here about forming doctors or jurists, whose work is also used by the republic.</p>
      <p>Your learning, however, understands that there will be a need for orders and classes in schools, so that one ascends from the lowest to the highest. Moreover, there is a need for the selection of talents according to the common saying: "Mercury is not carved from just any wood." But those who have once dedicated themselves to sacred studies and consecrated themselves to sacred ministries seem not so much to be instructed in good arts and sacred letters as in honesty of life and integrity of morals; for the impure, although they may be most learned, nevertheless destroy more by the licentiousness of life, which they have become accustomed to, in schools than they build and advance by polished learning.</p>
      <p>A moderately learned and pure life man will do more and promote piety; without such schools alien to corruption, you will scarcely preserve or propagate true religion far and wide. From well-established schools, however, will eventually emerge men most equipped to defend and spread sincere truth far and wide. But above all, prayers must be added, by which we implore the help of the Lord, that he may deign to form suitable workers for his vineyard.</p>
      <p>Among these things, it also seems worth mentioning that it will contribute not a little to the preservation and propagation of truth if we not only abolish harmful things but immediately substitute salutary things in place of those abolished. In this matter, many gravely err today, which also offends the minds of the pious. For who would approve of everything being removed and the people being neglected, nor being instructed in any religion and kept in order? There are those who think it enough to remove everything at once and daily thunder against abuses and abominations and even rage rabidly. But the Lord says to the prophet: "I have set you this day to root out and to pull down, to build and to plant." Therefore, idols, which were called the pictures and letters of the laity, have been removed; let the preaching of God's word be immediately restored, the letters, I say, speaking clearly of God's will, from which all may understand that God teaches by his word, that God is worshiped in spirit and truth, that God does not wish to be expressed by images or worshiped in them. The mass, which was sold as a sacrifice for the living and the dead, has been abolished; let the salutary Lord's Supper be restored, and in the meantime, let doctrine be added, by which all may learn that there is one and eternal sacrifice of Christ, by which all believers are expiated, and let them also learn that the sacrifices of Christians are henceforth spiritual. The foreign language and unintelligible murmur of psalms have been ejected from the temple of Christ; let legitimate and religious prayer be immediately instituted, let sacred assemblies be instituted, let the exposition of sacred letters be instituted according to the prescription of the apostle in 1 Corinthians. The lucrative trade has been proscribed from the temple; let it be made so that the people understand that almsgiving is required of them. We have mentioned these things as examples, from which your piety will easily judge similar things.</p>
      <p>From all these things, you understand, brothers, what our opinion is about preserving and propagating evangelical truth. We know that much more can be said about this matter; but we know we are speaking with the learned.</p>
      <p>Therefore, nothing else remains but to exhort you to continue steadfastly in the way of the Lord, diligently invoking his help, without which we will attempt nothing successfully. Pray to the Lord for us; for we also pray for you. Live and farewell. May the Lord our God bless you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, in the month of January, in the year of our Lord 1556. Pastors and readers, ministers of the church of Zurich.</p>
