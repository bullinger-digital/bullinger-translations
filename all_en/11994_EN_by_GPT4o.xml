    <p xml:id="regest1">The rumor that Bern intends to support the King of France [Francis I] militarily is, to his knowledge, unfounded, although Bern, due to the newly conquered [Vaud], must be more on guard than others and will certainly be asked for help if Emperor [Charles V] continues [the war]. In his sermon on July 6, Ritter warned against taking sides, but pointed out that the King, as the attacked party, had in vain sought peace with the support of the Confederation; the Emperor tolerates the Protestants even less than the King and supports Duke [Charles III of Savoy] in his feud with Bern; the following day he repeated this and made it clear that he in no way advocated war; unfaithful colleagues like Beat [Gering] nevertheless used his statements as an opportunity to slander him. According to Ritter's assessment, Bern will not engage in this war, which does not concern it. Greetings; a rumor concerning Bullinger was not believed by anyone here. He sends a lecture transcript from [Bernhard] Tillmann, which shows how concerning the education of the youth in Bern is, and asks for a response. Johannes [WÃ¤ber] is constantly fighting, albeit more bravely than wisely; he also sends his regards.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God, etc.</p>
      <p>Beloved lord and brother, I have received your letter, in which you mention a rumor that there is a cry among you that the honorable city of Bern intends to support the King of France, etc. Of this, I am completely unaware and do not believe that an honorable authority would ever have allowed such a thought to come to mind, even though the city of Bern is in great concern and danger due to the newly conquered land, and therefore needs to be more vigilant than others. However, I have never understood, either secretly or publicly, that anyone would want to engage in a willful war to protect either the crown of France or other people. You can confidently believe that this is not the case, although no one can deny that if the Emperor were to carry out his plans, the city of Bern would not remain unscathed. Regarding the sermon, I will not withhold the truth from you: The Emperor and the King are equally good, enemies of the holy gospel, enemies of freedom, although one can do more harm than the other, especially to Germany.</p>
      <p>Now, there are indeed those in Bern who would gladly see the French cause prevail, so that the city of Bern might have better peace, and also that all of Germany might overcome, not that they want to engage in an unnecessary war, but rather wait on God. On the other hand, there are those who are also well-disposed towards the Emperor, and it seemed to me that they want to support the Emperor so much that they would bring glowing coals under their own feet. On July 6, I preached, first admonishing the subjects not to show disobedience to the prohibition and not to leave their homeland to go to foreign wars, etc. I told the authorities that they have good Christian statutes, by which they should firmly abide and burden no one, but rather watch over their land, not engage in any party, hinder no one, and support no one; for if they were to take sides, which would not be right and they should not do, they would have more reason to side with the French than with the Emperor, because the French are not the aggressors this time, but are being attacked, and have sought peace; the entire Confederation has worked for this, but it has not been achieved; thus, he must defend his homeland against the right command. On the other hand, the Emperor does not want to make peace with the evangelicals. In his hereditary lands, he burns them as does the King, but in the free principalities and cities, they must also stand in danger against the Emperor. Thirdly, there is the newly conquered land, for which they stood in open feud against the Duke and against the Emperor as his helper, etc. But they should take no one's side and remain impartial and care for their own. I repeated this the next day and said with clear words that they should not understand me as giving them a reason to go to war, but rather that they should guard against it and take no side, but watch over their land, etc. But my unfaithful brothers, when they noticed that some misunderstanding was about to arise, instead of bringing water to extinguish the fire, they used the bellows to make the fire greater; they thought they now had the time to take revenge, especially Beat, may God give him his reward. I can well imagine that they wrote about it here and there; if I could get to the bottom of the matter, the whole world would know that they have shamefully lied about me.</p>
      <p>Therefore, by God's grace, it is still far from being the case that we would engage in a war that does not concern us, unless it is something that is hidden from me; but I do not believe it and do not trust my lords. Therefore, one remains firm, as is right, by the statutes made regarding the wars.</p>
      <p>Greet my dear lords and brothers all. As for you, there has indeed been such a rumor, but pious, honorable, and faithful people have not believed it; we have heard more of such rumors.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, July 28, 1544.</p>
      <p>I send to you the dictations of Telamon, which he read to our youth, so that you may see with what trifles our church is shaken and with whom we must constantly contend, so that you may judge and, if possible, send your judgment to us soon.</p>
      <p>Johannes fights steadfastly, if only he would combine prudence with courage, etc., who sends you and the other brothers many greetings, etc.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the pious, well-learned lord Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his dear lord and brother, etc.</p>
