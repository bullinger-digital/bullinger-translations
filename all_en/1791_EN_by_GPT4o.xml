      <p>Greetings. On the last day of the month, I received your autograph along with your most Christian book (most learned doctor), and I gave thanks to God, the best and greatest, our Father, for making your disciple aim at the same target as his most excellent teacher, although with a more extended and thus more distant and indeed coarser stroke. For you, the highest and most experienced theologian, immediately hit the target directly; I, however, as was fitting for my profession and diligence, attempted to drive towards the same goal sinuously and obliquely, as if doing something else, from ancient histories and hostile decrees and our own edicts, at least to attract. I had not yet seen your most learned book, which I was glad to hear from Lord Theodor Beza (as he said he had done at your request on the same day) was translated into the French language. I had also begun to translate mine in Basel, as many in France had demanded it from me, which (because I had heard from some that it had been started when I was passing through Germany at the end of August) I restore, even at the urging of those who had attempted it. I will move every stone (as much as will be in me, with the Lord giving) so that some door of the word of God may finally be opened in France, nor can I cast away the hope that the Lord will have mercy on so many there suffering a long famine of His word. On the 3rd of this month, late, through the servant of the son of Lord Justus Jonas (through whom, as he was to set out the same night, although with a damaged leg, I could not reply), I received two letters from my wife from Paris; she says she took care to have my letters given both to the queen and to Margaret of France and that they were kindly received and the king's arrival is awaited so that they may also be given to him. In these letters, I explain the reasons for my second departure and again offer a disputation, attempting to see if anything can be accomplished for the common cause. Otherwise, I would never return, even if the king offered a most illustrious magistracy. At the end of November, I was in Bern with the most pious man, Lord Peter Viret, the most faithful minister of the church of Lausanne, whom I accompanied, and I explained my intention of professing laws at my own expense and introducing typography to Lausanne to some of that senate. It was not very pleasing, partly because they feared the seeds of lawsuits (which I praise), but they could not understand that this correction was prepared to restrict them. Then I heard that the academy of Lausanne was disturbed every year by the plague, as I recently saw. On December 22, passing through Lausanne, I greeted the sons of the Landgrave of Hesse and the Duke of Mecklenburg and wrote to Lord Landgrave. If one or two of the faithful princes of Germany would honor me with the title of their counselor or advocate (without any stipends, which I neither want nor need, and yet I will always be ready for duty), that title prefixed to my books would raise many in France, and many in the king's court would have the opportunity to speak more boldly and freely both for the common cause and for me, and part of the good of France could be more easily preserved or sold. I wanted to ask for that title without stipends, although with the obligation of duty, from the lords of Bern, but because I did not understand with Lord Viret, to bring him back, I returned. It also seems to me that it is better from the princes, to whom if you can insinuate and it is convenient for you (for I do not want to delay your church or abuse your friendship), you will lightly help this cause, nor is there a lack of an honest occasion, so that I may more readily offer my service (if by chance they need it) than in Paris, then because I returned/visited Paris at my own risk in the very fury of the Sorbonne under the pretext of counsel in the cause of the Landgrave of Hesse, but in truth to praise the king's alliance with the princes of Germany and to declare their holy religion and especially the faith and constancy of the most Christian Duke of Saxony, professing myself openly in the midst of enemies, acting not so much as an advocate of any private cause as of religion and faith, meanwhile provoking the French to imitate the faith of the Germans. I had no leisure to write to you sooner. On the 6th of this month, I returned with my luggage to Geneva, where the better part of my books and registers had been taken, most conveniently received at the house of Lord Sarrazin, a pious man and distinguished physician, where I have a double chamber, and that in the upper part of the city. I am grateful and will always be most grateful, and I will most willingly repay, if I am or ever will be able to pay, for your so pious and more than paternal affection towards me. May the Lord hear your prayers and fulfill them.</p>
      <p>Moreover, none of my books so far has been worthy of you. In the year 1538, I published on the Parisian customs where, in 8 columns, I dispute against a certain superstitious opinion about the use of lots asserted by a Parisian counselor and about free will, fate, providence, faith, works, and predestination, but from the sophists' pits, which I had long explored in the pursuit of truth, I had not yet seen any German books nor dared to touch them, lest I, an inexperienced novice, be captivated by their eloquence (for this scruple the preachers of France, indeed seducers, had instilled in me). But now from their books, I had recognized many of their impostures; thus, I thought I was attacking both them and Lord Martin Luther from the disputation, yet imposing no insult on Lord Luther: for it was a matter of religion for me to speak ill of him, whose writings I had not seen, even if I did not think the French preachers were entirely lying. At the end of the disputation, I conclude with Paul and Augustine that nothing should be attributed to works concerning the grace of God and eternal salvation, but everything to the grace of God and election. This was so suspect to the Sorbonnists that their dean approached me, exploring, dissembling, and entangling various difficulties about free will, which, as he saw, I did not understand nor grasp the sense of the Germans, which he deceitfully concealed, he left. Shortly after, a pious man approached me, bringing a book of Lord Luther on Exodus (for they had often touched me, but so often overwhelming them with a multitude of sophistic allegations, I was more affirmed in the opinion, considering them unlearned and frivolous). He indeed said: "What if I show you that you are in the same opinion about free will in your book with Martin Luther?" and having opened the little book, he read the place where he does not speak of externals nor economic nor political and other lower matters when he disputes about free will, but only concerning heavenly things and the works of the Holy Spirit and salvation. I was amazed that such perfidy could have been in the French impostors for so long, that I had been deceived by them with the people for so long. From then on, I wanted to see the books of the Germans, especially yours. Hence, in later books, I always sprinkled something in favor of the church and the word of God, especially in the book on commerce, usury, constituted money returns, and coins published in Paris in 1545 and in the French epitome with the Sorbonne murmuring but not daring to attack, since I had already gained authority and could defend, so that against their will and not daring to issue a censure, I had it printed in 1544 during that flight from Paris in September, a French exposition on the Lord's Prayer.</p>
      <p>I am preparing more on laws and customs and especially a refutation of all papal constitutions. Farewell, most dear doctor and teacher, venerable to me with paternal affection.</p>
      <p>I wish health to your most illustrious sons-in-law Lavater, the son of the consul, and Zwingli, the son of the most illustrious Zwingli, and the most beloved lords and fathers Lord Pellican, Lord Bibliander (whom I am surprised recently prefixed a letter and imprudently, as I think, praised the work of a certain French impostor Guillaume Postel, whom his many deeds and writings show to be a fanatic), Lord Gessner, Lord Gualther, Lord Wolf. Again, farewell happily in the Lord. Geneva, January 15, 1553. By my own hand, still not having a regular scribe.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Charles du Moulin, jurist. To the most illustrious doctor of the church, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful and vigilant minister of the church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
