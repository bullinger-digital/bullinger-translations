      <p>Greetings. Although, most distinguished man and most revered compater, I do not have anything special to write at present, I could not refrain from sending you my most dutiful greetings through our Caspar Luter.</p>
      <p>I recently heard, though I do not know how true it is, that Mr. Tobias Egli in Chur, along with his colleague, has been removed from their offices and expelled from Rhaetia because of the revealed bull of Planta and because they strongly opposed the military expedition to France. This rumor has caused considerable horror both to me and to my fellow ministers and brothers; for if the papists have been able to do so much, what will they not attempt in the other parts of Switzerland? If what is said is true, we especially commend Mr. Tobias to you; for he is worthy, having always shown himself faithful in his office, and all pious people should receive him honorably and adorn him with the greatest benefits. I received your letter dated February 13th, along with the edict from Zurich against the French expedition and the note sent to you from Basel. For all of these, we give you our greatest thanks and earnestly ask that you always deign to inform us of those matters which are of interest for us to know, and we will, in turn, gratify you if we can.</p>
      <p>Please send the enclosed letters to your son Mr. Johann Rudolf or hand them to someone who will certainly deliver them to the prefect in RÃ¼nen, and you will do me a favor.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most honorable compater, and always consider me most commendable.</p>
      <p>In haste, from Glarus, February 19, 1573. Johannes Hug, your compater, in Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and honorable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most vigilant minister of the church in Zurich, his most honorable and dear lord and compater.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
