    <p xml:id="regest1">What Vadian [in a letter not preserved] wrote is true, namely that the Zurich council received a letter [dated December 12, 1545] from Nuremberg. Bullinger learned that it concerns a private matter. A [correctly: two] Nurembergers, [the land steward Wolfgang Harsdörfer and his brother Christoph] have lent [Konrad] Aebli [also: Äppli], a citizen of Zurich, 600 guilders. Since the debtor has now left Zurich, the Nuremberg council wants to ensure with the Zurich council that their citizen does not suffer any loss. - [Former] Ammann [Hans] Vogler [the Elder] will report orally about Zurich. - Myconius wrote on December 22 from Basel that the Belgians are increasingly unable to endure the Emperor [Charles V]. Mercenaries coming from France have reported that a new conflict has broken out between [King Francis I] of France and [Charles V], and this during a meeting [of the envoys] of [Charles V], [Francis I], and [King Henry VIII] of England. It is suspected that the discord is due to the Emperor's attempt to cunningly take Turin. Therefore, Captain [Wilhelm] Frölich is said to have been summoned by [Francis I]. Someone [...] from Strasbourg reported [in Basel] that it was decided in Frankfurt, among other things, to maintain the Schmalkaldic League, regardless of the decisions of the Emperor, the Pope [Paul III], the council, or the imperial diets; furthermore, that no one should help an ally unless they are attacked [for their loyalty] to the word of God. However, Bullinger does not find this decision credible. - Myconius further reported that from the courts of Duke George of Württemberg and the young Duke [Christoph of Württemberg]-Montbéliard, it is heard that the Protestants have forgiven [Duke Henry of] Brunswick and rehabilitated him because he is said to have joined them, which Bullinger again cannot believe. If it is true, however, the Protestants have harmed themselves! For what should Saul be among the prophets [1 Sam 10:11], the wolf among the sheep? - Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Letters were brought to our council from Nuremberg, as you mentioned. Since I understood that you were curious about their contents, I inquired and learned that it is a private matter. It concerns a certain citizen who lent 600 gold coins to Aebli, our fellow citizen. Since he has left the city, the Nuremberg council requests that our council diligently ensures their citizen does not suffer any loss, etc. There is nothing of our affairs that I should write or keep you occupied with. Here you have living letters from Ammann Vogler, an old friend. Myconius writes from Basel on December 22nd: "Those in the Netherlands under the Emperor are beginning to find the burdens increasingly unbearable, as they grow heavier day by day.</p>
      <p>The soldiers coming from France spread news of a new conflict arising between the King of France and the Emperor, and this during a meeting of the Emperor, the King of France, and the King of England. The cause is not disclosed. Some suspect it is because the Emperor attempted to cunningly capture Turin. Captain Frölich is believed to have been summoned by the King for this reason.</p>
      <p>Someone from Strasbourg reported yesterday that among other things, it was decided at the assembly in Frankfurt, and perhaps is now being acted upon: firstly, that the Schmalkaldic League will remain steadfast in the confession of truth, regardless of what the Emperor, the Pope, the council, and any diets may decide; secondly, that no one should provide anything to another by virtue of the league, unless they are attacked for the word of God." These are his words; but these articles seem very doubtful to me. He adds: "From the court of Duke George of Württemberg, and also from the court of the young Duke of Montbéliard, it is reported that the Duke of Brunswick has obtained pardon from the Protestants and is therefore to be restored in full and considered among the Protestants." These are his words; which does not seem credible to me. But if this is the case, it seems to be a great disgrace and danger for the Protestants to have accepted him. What, I ask, will Saul do among the prophets? What does the wolf dance in the choir of sheep? But time, which reveals all things, will also reveal what this will become. Farewell in Christ the Savior, who may grant that this year has dawned happily for you and your entire family, and may it end most happily. Zurich, December 27, in the year of our Lord 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Joachim Vadian, the most prudent consul of St. Gallen, always to be honored by his lord. St. Gallen.</p>
