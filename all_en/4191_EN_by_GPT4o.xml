      <p>News, which you probably already know in part without a doubt.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Basel has reconciled with the city in all matters and is supposed to enter there shortly, swear the citizen's oath, and they to him as well, which the people of Solothurn are exceedingly displeased about; for they had no other expectation than that they had bound the bishop so tightly that he could no longer escape them and would indeed become a citizen with them. The bishop has now given the citizens of Biel a seven-barrel cask of wine and 24 measures of grain to the poor, and he intends to visit them shortly; there is concern now that this is a sign of his impending death.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Cologne is said to have certainly accepted the gospel, like the pious Bishop Hermann did years ago; however, the priests along with the council are strongly against him, but the nobility and the common citizens are with him. The Bishop of Trier is said to be imprisoned because he had an evangelical preacher hanged, etc. The priests in Strasbourg, despite all their numerous, wondrous practices and deceptions, have had to leave the city with much mockery and disgrace, except for two or three who have submitted to all obedience. Who the current new pope is and what kind of wicked creature he is, you will have undoubtedly heard. The Venetians have negotiated so much with the commander at Nysa that he intended to hand over Nysa to them, which would have happened if the Duke of Savoy had not unexpectedly arrived there, turned the situation around, and hanged the commander. An old lord and knight from Echingen, of great renown, who has three or four seats in the Black Forest, recently gave his only son a wife of good hope, expecting to be gladdened in his old age. However, the son recently captured a messenger of the regiment at Ensisheim and put him in harsh imprisonment, for which the regiment wrote to the father and requested that he have this matter resolved with the son. The father immediately set out, rode to the son, and requested that he release the prisoner and clear himself with the regiment, to which the son objected, saying he was no chancellor and would not write to them. He went out, took a saber, waited for the father at the door, and as soon as he came out, struck him down and then continued to strike him, cutting off a hand and wounding him so grievously that he died within a few hours. Thereafter, the subjects petitioned the emperor, asking him to provide them with another lord, for they did not want the murderer as their superior; it is not known what will happen. A peasant from Meienried, on his way home from BÃ¼ren, suddenly fell down on the road among his companions and died, though he was not at all drunk. A fine, young, healthy woman and hostess in Neuenstadt, not far from Biel, also suddenly fell down dead at the table. A peasant recently filled himself so much in Solothurn that he immediately fell down dead in front of the city by a granary. From many places, one hears daily how some people suddenly die, some sober, some full of wine. In Biel, some children die from choking, which gets stuck in their throats; also, some other illnesses are going around, from which people lie sick for several weeks and then recover. Dated January 18, 1560.</p>
      <p>I wrote the other letter eight days ago and intended to send it to you; I missed the messenger. Tomorrow I will go to Griessenberg with my wife for the wedding of my dearest niece from my sister, and then perhaps also to my brother Vultureius near Constance, where I will stay for some time. Do ensure that we feel your blessed advocacy at the throne of grace.</p>
