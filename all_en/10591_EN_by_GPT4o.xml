      <p>Greetings. Although the messenger hastened his departure, dearest Heinrich, I did not want him to come empty-handed because of his loyalty to both of us. I received your letter dated March 11 through your envoys, in which I understood that you have not yet received all of mine. Now, however, since you have undoubtedly received everything, the merchant will bring me a response from you; if not, let it be done through another.</p>
      <p>As for the cannons and banners, they seemed like tales to me, but I was compelled to do what I did not want.</p>
      <p>Alas, Sepianus has become another person, which I have concealed for a long time, and things are such among our people that I can boast of nothing, nor can I commit to paper what makes me anxious.</p>
      <p>There are many, indeed countless, matters I would have to discuss with you, which I certainly dare not share with any mortal. But I see it is arranged in such a way that I can meet with you nowhere. I would prefer to meet with you in utmost secrecy alone, away from all business, in Lenzburg or KÃ¶nigsfeld, if my bodily discomfort allowed, which it will, unless I die soon. When you come, I will also come, if I can, to the meeting now to be held; my love and spirit for you will draw me to do so. If you do not come, you will have Megander with one of ours, as we have written.</p>
      <p>Hemman Haberer, the steward of Hartmann von Hallwil, our mutual friend, has today been appointed as the scribe of the Lenzburg district and will reside in the town. Whatever letters you entrust to him, he will ensure they are delivered to me most faithfully.</p>
      <p>I will write the rest with your envoys.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>March 16, 1535.</p>
      <p>Yours, B. H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
