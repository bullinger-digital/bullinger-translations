      <p>Greetings. I wrote the enclosed letter eight days ago, but there was no one present to whom it could be entrusted. Therefore, I have kept it until today and have nothing worth mentioning, except that this week I received letters from Paris. Mr. Coignet, Johannes Wilhelm Stucki, and another Frenchman wrote. The summary of all: "We enjoy peace by the grace of God, and the churches of God are growing in a marvelous way. Pray for us, that we may remain so for a long time. There are certain seeds of discord from the marriage of Namur and the widow of Guise; for the most noble lady was first married to Namur, from whom she bore a son, but now she has been rejected with great disgrace. This grieves many princes. May nothing evil arise from this! The Pope blessed the marriage of Namur. In recent days, the Admiral and his brother Andelot have come to court. Remarkably, good literature and the arts are flourishing now more than ever before, etc." - Our envoys have spoken honorably of you to me, nor do I hear them say otherwise to others. They reported complaints brought against you there; but they seem to recognize the nature and customs of the people, etc. The Bernese envoys spoke with great praise of your doctrine at the table in the inn, but they added that otherwise, you are restless and many attribute to you the main cause of this dissension. I replied: 'Thus it happens that we priests, in all that others mock, must bear the blame. But we are accustomed to patiently endure what the Lord has given and imposed upon us. It is enough for us if our innocence becomes known someday.' They kindly accepted this from me, and not another word was spoken. - I have received nothing at all from Augsburg so far from those I mentioned recently. The Lutherans are raging against us; Hesshusius is said to be writing against us again. We are doing well here; may you also fare well and may the Lord protect you in the midst of the plague, who protected Daniel in the lions' den and his companions in the burning furnace.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever. June 14, 1566. Yours truly, as always.</p>
      <p>To the man of outstanding piety and learning, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the church in Chur, my esteemed lord and dearest brother and comrade. Chur.</p>
