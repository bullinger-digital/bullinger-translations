    <p xml:id="regest1">Beat [Gering] and [Simon] Sulzer have shamelessly tried before the council to prevent the appointment [of Jodocus Kilchmeyer to Bern]. They complained about the Great Council because of the delay [in filling the dean's position] caused by it. Moreover, their nomination proposal, which they submitted by virtue of their episcopal office, was not trusted. As a result, the matter was postponed until today, and the letters from the council, from [Andreas] Rappenstein, and W채ber [No. 2584] were not sent.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Despite the cunning of Gering and Sulzer, the council has now decided today to promptly advance the appointment of the elected. W채ber was tasked with writing to Bullinger and Kilchmeyer, but due to lack of time, he only addresses Bullinger. However, Kilchmeyer should not be deterred by the intrigues of some preachers!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Rappenstein is not in Bern, otherwise he would have written to [Kilchmeyer] himself. [Peter] Im Haag asks Bullinger to remember their last conversation in Zurich and to act in the interest of the church of Bern.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The old choir [court] scribe Hans Glaner was commissioned by Rappenstein to write to Kilchmeyer. Everyone should do their best in favor of the Gospel, as they are tired of the ongoing complaints of the [opponents]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The content of the last [enclosed] letter from W채ber [No. 2584] remains valid. Now Kilchmeyer should come to Bern without delay, as the opportunity cannot be more favorable!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Greetings.</p>

      <p>Dear Bullinger, I cannot write as I should about the situation. Beat and Sulzer have been so shamelessly bold that they attempted to prevent the appointment before the council, with great complaints about the sins of over two hundred; that their choice, like that of the bishops, is not trusted, etc. Thus, the matter was postponed until today, so that neither my gracious lords' letters nor those of Rappenstein and mine could be advanced. But today, the council unanimously decided, despite the deceitful and fraudulent intentions of the two, that they should write and send to the elected without delay, etc. Thus, I have been encouraged by special lords and friends to write to you and Mr. Jodocus earnestly and with utmost urgency, not to hinder such a vocation, which is truly from God Himself, but to promote it to the best of your ability against your council and among yourselves, with unwavering hope that God will support our church and restore it to good peace. This admonition is made so earnestly, not because we do not wish all good to you all, but because we fear the evil practices of some restless preachers, who might perhaps want to make hindrances from here to Mr. Jodocus. Therefore, do as you have done so far, and we trust you well. Admonish Mr. Jodocus (for I cannot write myself in such haste), that he does not despise God's church, which has called him, and lead it to ruin, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Rappenstein is not in the city. Otherwise, he would have written himself. But my dear lord and godfather Peter Im Haag urges you to remember what he last discussed with you in Zurich and to do what the benefit and honor of our church require.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Mr. Jodocus writes on behalf of Rappenstein, my dear godfather Hans Glaner, the old choir scribe. Everyone would gladly do their best (so tired are they of the burden of complaints) so that the simplicity and purity of the Gospel are not taken away from us!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The rest remains as previously written, only that Mr. Jodocus should come here without delay, for it will never be more favorable, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Commended to God and heartily greet all your coworkers, preachers, and teachers.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>From Bern, on the 15th of September, 1546. Johannes W채ber, your always willing.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
