      <p> Greetings. I received the letter that, in your kindness, you deigned to write to me, along with the printed book you sent to me. Truly great man, I thank your kindness and generosity for this book; however, I would seem to be greatly honored if you had written in your most holy and learned hand on the front of the book: Heinrich Bullinger sends to his Gallicius. Mr. Consul Johannes Tscherner requests that I ensure a copy is sent to him from there and that the price of the printer is indicated. Therefore, make sure to send him a copy to me, with the price assigned; in the meantime, I thank you on my behalf and will also return thanks, not as you deserve, but with a small gift declaring my gratitude. Regarding the German schoolmaster, I read your letter to the senate today by order of Consul Tscherner. The senate requests that Johannes Klainer come, if it can be done conveniently for him; if not, they are pleased with what you say about another. They explicitly say they will give fifty good Rhenish guilders, good white lodging, two good batzen from each student every fasting period; if he teaches well and diligently, he will also be given a good stipend in wood. However, they are willing to commit and promise to someone many times, if they do not do it, they see then that someone persists with diligent teaching and good conduct. Moreover, he can also earn something by writing, and if he wants to have and teach private students on Friday, as sometimes happens in the cities, he can make his arrangements with them as he wishes. If Johannes Stainer does not want to come, our lords have a service, that he informs the exiles from Konstanz for the sake of faith about these matters, if he is willing to come. We ask that you act on our behalf and, as soon as possible, send us an answer. - Furthermore, we hear about Ferdinand, the Roman Emperor, auspicious for the gospel, we do not know how true it is. We hear in Piedmont the Swiss have been struck; we await what news from Rome brings us. - Father Comander greets you. </p>
      <p> I am preparing, having set aside all else, to read your book and I do not doubt that you have wished to present something worthy of your age and learning, writing against the Swabians or Saxons; I do not doubt that you remember to respond more for the simple-minded than as these slanderers deserve, and for that reason, to act more forcefully. Do not think, as is your modesty, that it is always necessary to act less sharply. Where there is a biting dog, there should be a stick. Farewell, greatest man, and never cease to love your Philipp. </p>
      <p> From Chur, on the very day of Matthias in the year 1556. </p>
      <p> Entirely yours in kindness, Philipp Gallicius. </p>
      <p> To the truly great man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all good people. ZÃ¼rich. </p>
