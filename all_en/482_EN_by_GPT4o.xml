      <p>Strasbourg, April 1, 1549.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I have received your very friendly letters, dearest Bullinger, the first indeed through Pharellus' brother, the others through our friend John Hooper, who arrived here safely with his family two days ago, guided by God. I congratulate you Swiss not only because you have come to such a good agreement among yourselves, but also for the whole of Germany; for this will be of the greatest benefit to all Germans. May God, the best and greatest, grant that the peace established remains long-lasting, firm, and perpetual! Our city is deteriorating day by day; two preachers, Bucer and Phagius, have been dismissed by the authority of the senate, and Paulus has departed, with another soon to leave. May the Lord protect our England from both! Preaching continues and mass is not yet held among us; however, a bishop has been anointed and has celebrated mass once. All the priests of his domain will gather in Saverne tomorrow and will consult on suppressing Christ and His gospel.</p>
      <p>But the Lord will destroy the plans of the wicked, I have no doubt. From England, I have no news except that in the last month of February, there was a conflict between the English and the Scots. Our side lost a castle they had previously taken due to treachery; however, shortly after, there was a battle, and in that battle, many Scots and French were killed, and many were captured, among whom are twelve of the French nobility and the chief leader of the French among the Scots. There is a rumor here of a future marriage between the widow of Lorraine and the brother of the King of Denmark. May the Lord grant us His grace, preserve His own, amen.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, John Burcher.</p>
      <p>The traitor who was plotting the death of our king was condemned to death on March 12, and undoubtedly, the punishment has been carried out on him.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher, my kind lord and friend.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich.</p>
