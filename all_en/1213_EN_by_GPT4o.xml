      <p>Most illustrious man, when I had already sealed the letters, I received some news from Italy, namely that Cardinal Crescentius Leguleus has been declared the legate of the future council, just as I had predicted in my letter to the King of England.</p>
      <p>Other cardinals will not preside with him, but two bishops, one of whom will be from Fano (as I suppose). In Rome, there is a great scarcity of grain. Cardinal Cornaro of Venice, a notably wicked man, has died. But listen to other things that torment me and will also torment you, I am sure: a most pestilent heresy has arisen in Padua, which not only suggests that men should be rebaptized, but that Christ was born from the corruptible seed of Joseph; and to support this horrendous blasphemy, they deny a large part of the Gospels, oh shame! The matter is certain.</p>
      <p>I am expecting new brothers any day now, who are preparing to flee, but they are of sincere doctrine, not those fanatical and impious men.</p>
      <p>There are many other things that you will gladly hear, but I prefer to bring them with me rather than commit them to letters, especially since I do not have a reliable messenger.</p>
      <p>There is a good and wealthy man among us who wishes to buy the Old and New Testament in German, well-bound in folio. If Mr. Michael would send it to Mr. Comander, who would take care of it for me, I will bring him the money. Farewell in the Lord and pray for all the churches, which are so disturbed by this foul tempest.</p>
      <p>I greet the church and the whole school.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, on the Ides of March 1551.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, etc.</p>
