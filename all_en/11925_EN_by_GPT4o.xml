    <p xml:id="regest1">Could not send this letter with the butchers the day before, so he sends it with his own messenger; he is concerned about the offensive aid [granted by the Imperial Estates at the Diet of Speyer] against [Francis I], which will only bring disaster to Germany regardless of the decision of the [Imperial] cities; the consequences of a split among the Confederates due to a demand for protection [by Francis I] are unforeseeable, and it would be even more devastating if they were to support France as a whole due to the [Perpetual Peace]; he is worried that the cities will find it difficult to withdraw their consent [to the offensive aid]. If [Francis I] were to advocate for the maintenance of good neighborliness in a letter to Strasbourg, the city could apologize to the Estates; the Confederates should also draft such a letter; he hopes that the envoys of the cities will not approve anything without consultation, so there is still time for that. Zurich should also write to Konstanz about the disadvantages that the approval [of the offensive aid] could bring and emphasize good neighborliness - this might convince the city to refuse and use the letter as a reason for it; he cannot write everything he knows; he fears folly, especially since Konstanz experiences complaints from the Confederates daily; one should pray to God. He previously wrote about a great [military] art, may God grant the inventor [Konrad Zwick] steadfastness! The messenger's wage should be spared for Bullinger, as he can also inform Mayor [Diethelm] Röist and it is a matter of general interest, otherwise Blarer himself will cover the messenger's wage; he will immediately inform Bullinger of any news; one should pray.</p>

      <p>Especially trusted, friendly, dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>I intended to send you this enclosed letter yesterday through our butchers, but they had already departed, and since I know of no other messenger and consider it very important, I decided to send you my own messenger for this reason. I had many thoughts last night about where these matters might lead if this offensive aid against the French were to proceed. Whether the cities agree or not, there will be great cruel upheaval in the German nation. Should the Confederates then also decide to protect and defend the French in their territory, they must consider what harm could arise from it. If they then, as I think they are obliged to do for the sake of the alliance, unanimously with all their might support the French, it is easy to foresee what misery, lamentation, bloodshed, and devastation of the land must follow when these potentates bind all their power and resources to one another, so that it would require great vigilance, as everyone thought, to free themselves in the best and most bearable way. I am exceedingly anxious for our pious cities; for the words of the lords are now exceedingly sweet and good; one can easily be blinded by them. And I pray to God with all my heart that He may prevent them from agreeing to it, although there is great concern that they will complacently agree, especially since the protesting princes, etc., have consented to such things.</p>
      <p>I thought, if it were possible, that a letter should be written without delay to those in Strasbourg through the French, concerning such matters, and that they should consider what is at stake for them and for him, so that they do not let good neighborliness be disrupted, as is indeed the truth, and if one could lay this out at length, it would be exceedingly good and useful; for with this and because of such writing, those in Strasbourg would have some excuse for their situation against the other estates. I also thought for many reasons it would be more useful if such writing were done through the French rather than the common Confederates, although if they also wanted to write, it might do no harm, provided it all happened without delay. I hope the envoys of the cities at Speyer will not approve such serious, important matters without reporting back to their lords, so that perhaps nothing might be neglected in the aforementioned writing if it were done quickly. On the other hand, I know well how one sometimes hurries and through posts (messengers, messages) rushes things, so it is quite possible it may be too late.</p>
      <p>I also consider it very good that the common Confederates write to my lords of Konstanz about such an opinion, how it concerns them, that they are expected to consider what stands on all this, to what disadvantage this approval might reach all parts, how much is at stake in such good neighborliness, as one could then bring forward many and various reasons, etc. For thus, I hoped, my lords might be moved to refuse it, and could also use such writing of the Confederates as a reason, etc. I would gladly, with all my heart, wish that this misery would be prevented. I need not write to you what I know; one now awaits other letters every day, and perhaps some writings are present, in which one presumes to weave blue smoke before the eyes. So mankind can work wonders upon wonders, and the lords are highly colored, clever, pretending smooth and sweet, that truly my heart trembles at these matters, as I fear greatly that one might commit folly, especially since (as you might well know) this city daily experiences not insignificant complaints from the Confederates. It requires fervent praying and crying to God, that He may keep us on His path.</p>
      <p>I have previously written to you about a great matter and art; I pray to God with all my heart that He may grant the inventor strength for all good.</p>
      <p>I know that this matter also concerns you, as is proper, therefore I could not refrain from writing this to you by my own messenger, to whom, if you do not know how to pay the messenger's fee outside of your purse, it is not necessary, I will do it; but since I can bear it, that you also inform my gracious lord Mayor Röist of this, and it is a common matter, I think one should pay the messenger otherwise without your harm; if not, you should be at ease, I will satisfy him. You might perhaps have the news beforehand; yet my faithful concern has driven me to express my thoughts and good considerations in this way.</p>
      <p>As soon as other letters come further, I will, as much as possible, always inform you, as soon as I have a message, or if the matters become so great and important, by my own messenger.</p>
      <p>Let us cry out to heaven. It was never more necessary; angry storms hang above us. May the strong God grant that they may graciously subside. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given on the 22nd of March in the year 1544.</p>
