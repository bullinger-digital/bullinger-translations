      <p>Greetings. Contrary to hope and expectation, Reverend Father in Christ, it happened that all of ours, who indeed came here to the synod and assembly, came completely devoid of any new matters.</p>
      <p>I was with great men at banquets; but they did not speak a word about Italian affairs.</p>
      <p>Those who diligently inquire into the acts of the council, among whom is also the illustrious man Martinengo, can learn nothing except this one thing, that they have somewhat regained their spirits and are conducting some clandestine councils.</p>
      <p>This can be observed from the frequent posts by which they solicit the petty rulers of Italy.</p>
      <p>A certain man from Brescia told Mr. Martinengo that there was a day when twelve couriers (as they call them), partly Venetian, partly from Trento, passed through Brescia towards Milan, and several of them penetrated as far as France.</p>
      <p>This itself is evidence for us that the affairs of our people in France are not yet in port; but there are also those in Milan who openly boast that the French peace will not be stable and lasting.</p>
      <p>The same things have been reported here about French affairs as you write. But Bäldius also noted something similar in his letters from Schorrer.</p>
      <p>If Condé were to return this favor to the English, he would certainly be worthy of all hatred; but I do not easily believe the adversaries, I hope for better things and look to the Lord, who will graciously advance this whole matter, which He has so wonderfully begun.</p>
      <p>There were those who said the Danish war was quelled, which you write is rekindling.</p>
      <p>I return the letters in good faith, I could not do so sooner and faster because I did not have suitable people to whom I could give them.</p>
      <p>I give you the greatest thanks I can for your labor and paternal goodwill towards me.</p>
      <p>Our synod was quite peaceful; only one Italian attended.</p>
      <p>This displeased the brothers; for when they need our counsel, they cry out to heaven and earth and are very troublesome petitioners; now, when many things should have been consulted in common, they themselves desist.</p>
      <p>Petrus Leo returned to Chiavenna and is the author of many disturbances.</p>
      <p>As for the example of the Polish churches, which one Stancarus has so miserably torn apart, Mr. Philipp and I approached the Senate of the Three Leagues in the name of the brothers; we explained the character and nature of the man; but we also showed what monstrous opinions he refused to condemn in his pamphlet written against the church of Chiavenna.</p>
      <p>The Senate of the Three Leagues ordered him to be apprehended and proceeded against him with capital punishment.</p>
      <p>We indeed did not expect such a harsh sentence (and I think he will consult his safety by fleeing, which I certainly wish); but nevertheless, this severity of the lords will restrain similar plagues in the future.</p>
      <p>I would prefer something harsher to have been established against Stancarus in Poland first than now having so many churches set against each other.</p>
      <p>We have given this prelude to Vergerio as well, so that he may see it will not be safe for him to attempt anything in our churches. - The business of the Pellizari has proceeded quite successfully.</p>
      <p>Three men from the Grisons have been appointed; they are to reinvent the monastery anew and take the documents and records into their hands and appoint an official to manage the goods.</p>
      <p>If by the time of St. Martin's Day the Pellizari have not been relieved of their property by the Milanese monks, then they should proceed and seize the property.</p>
      <p>It was not expected that this might have a precedent, since it is the common property of the Three Leagues, and there would still be much to discuss; for the property might be turned to a school or other better uses in common.</p>
      <p>However, since the matters are thus arranged, that as soon as the Pellizari desist, no one would be capable of driving the matter against the monks so effectively, and fearing the matter would again be delayed, I have allowed myself to be persuaded and helped in this, solely so that this devil's spawn might be brought to an end.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, the lords of the day, even the papists, have behaved very friendly and attended the sermons diligently; for as many as there are of them, they have gone together from the town hall to the sermon.</p>
      <p>These are our affairs.</p>
      <p>Regarding the business of Vincentius Pestelotius, you rightly advise, and I will not trouble you further in the future.</p>
      <p>I had already written in the same sense to Mr. Ulissi Martinengo, asking him not to recommend such cases to me anymore, as I would reserve myself entirely for ecclesiastical matters.</p>
      <p>As soon as I learn anything certain about Italian affairs, I will write to you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, Reverend Father in Christ, for as long and as happily as possible with all yours.</p>
      <p>I had forgotten this, relatives send Stephan Heim, who delivers this to you, to Basel for the sake of studies; they asked me to recommend him to Mr. Sulzer.</p>
      <p>I mentioned all the difficulties; for I could speak freely with Tscharner about this.</p>
      <p>We examined Stephan and understood that he has the right understanding of the sacrament.</p>
      <p>Therefore, understanding that he is well equipped against such monsters, I agreed and wrote to Sulzer; however, you will also remind Stephan to beware of those tricksters.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, June 14, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man with singular learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and Reverend Father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
