      <p>My willing service, along with whatever I can do that is good and kind, before you, honorable, dear sir.</p>
      <p>A few times ago, Mr. Niklaus Briefer, dean at St. Peter's in Basel, sent me a book of coats of arms and instructed me to send it back down to Zurich to Mr. Georg Müller, the former abbot of Wettingen, after I had used it. He was then supposed to send the book back to Basel. And as I have since learned, the aforementioned Mr. Georg has been called by God.</p>
      <p>Now that I am informed that the above-mentioned dean in Basel is well known to you, I am sending this book along with a letter belonging to it to you, with an earnest request that you kindly forward it on occasion, when Froschauer or others are sending something to Basel, to the aforementioned dean along with the letter. I am willing to pay a few coins, or whatever it is, in advance; it does not need to be so urgent, as it will happen eventually, although it is not fair that I should trouble you with such a task. However, if I could show you a similar or greater service, I would be willing, and I ask that you do not take my request too harshly. With this, I commend you to God at all times.</p>
      <p>Given in Glarus, December 6, 1541. Gilg Tschudi from Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my gracious, dear sir.</p>
