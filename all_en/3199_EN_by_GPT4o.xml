      <p>Greetings. I hope that all the sheets I have sent so far have reached you; I have sent a, b, c, d, e, five gatherings. Now, having found a courier, I am sending the next two, f and g, and will soon send others on the next occasion. I proceed as much as I can, and I wish I could have completed more by now, before the evil spirit could cause any hindrance. I am also sending letters received today from Frankfurt from Valérand Poullain, a portion of which is addressed to me, in which he wishes you and Dr. Peter Martyr to be present at the upcoming meeting in Worms and encourages me to write to you about it. Therefore, I preferred that you see Valérand's own handwriting, and I do not have the time to write more extensively now.</p>
      <p>I wish you and all the pious among you to be well in Christ. In Basel, suddenly, May 30, 1557.</p>
      <p>Johannes Oporinus, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, churchman of Zürich, esteemed lord and friend.</p>
