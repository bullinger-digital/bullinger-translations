      <p>Thanks to the most merciful Father and Lord Jesus, that we still see your letters; may He, having shown mercy to us, make it so that we may see them more often in the future (as we hope). Amen. For we received your letters with the booklets sent to us with great joy. However, we will send the letters to Schwarz (Niger) as soon as we can. On the 8th of January, a messenger was here sent by the Duke of Wittenberg for Vergerius, who was to go there. The messenger, deterred by the immense mountains and snow, did not want to go to Vergerius himself. We sent to Vergerius and have not yet received a response from him; we think he could not come to us, delayed by those snows.</p>
      <p>No news here is worthy of your reading; for the affairs of the Emperor are more harmful than we should write about. We entirely judge that it would be better for our affairs, Rhaetian and Swiss, if the Emperor were to succumb, and also for the Germans; yet we concede to that verse: The victorious cause pleased the gods, but the defeated one pleased Cato. But, lest we trouble you with impious matters, let us close. May the Lord Jesus grant you to us and to the world, so that we may have you as a guide in following the Lord for a long time. Shortly, we will write more, which we have gathered for your knowledge and judgment. Farewell, light of the world, our foremost honor and by far the sweetest. We put down the pen. Given at Chur, on the 16th of January, in the year 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander and Philippus Gallicius. To the most learned and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord.</p>
