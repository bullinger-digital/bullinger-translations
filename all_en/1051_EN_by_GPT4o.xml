      <p>Greetings. I received your letter along with the medicine, beloved brother in the Lord, and there is no doubt that you have shown me a welcome favor; for since it was not possible to send your own messenger more conveniently, both your singular piety towards me and the weakness of my body demanded it. Therefore, I thank you for the benefit you have bestowed. You further demonstrate with this concern for us the spirit you possess towards the people of Bern. I will explain to the Bishop of Diesbach at leisure when I meet him. Your uncle sends you many greetings; he gladly received the discourse on sacrifices because he earnestly loves the word of God. Moreover, there are various war rumors among us. Some say that the Emperor has surrounded the King of England, so that he cannot escape the Emperor's hands by sea. Some firmly deny that the Turk is armed; others affirm that he has invaded Sicily, Sardinia, and Corsica. We hear that Magdeburg has been freed from siege. Some Frenchmen among us proclaim that the Imperial army has left Parma; we have heard here in Lenzburg from a certain Frenchman of great renown that the King of France has completely defected from the Pope, appointing a patriarch throughout the kingdom of France. The Augsburg senate has acted treacherously with its preachers; now they are in contention with the Imperialists; the people are in turmoil; some preachers are being recalled as if by right of return, and Satan himself, the author of this evil, desires that the presence of our people may avert a greater evil.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Württemberg has been granted freedom by the Emperor; it has been allowed that Christ may be freely preached, a great and pious prince has purchased this freedom, indeed not unwisely. In the future, the Lord may perhaps stir up wrath against us, which we have often deserved. If you have any certain news from England, please write back, I implore you.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Due to pain, I cannot write more. Given on the 16th of October. I greet your wife and sons-in-law in my name, etc.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius Schuler.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the church of Zürich, lord brother and old friend, to be greatly respected.</p>
