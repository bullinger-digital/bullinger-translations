      <p>Greetings. I confess that I owe you much, most excellent man, for you have restored to me letters once lost due to the negligence of others, found through your diligence. Therefore, I give you immortal thanks for your kindness, and I will hold them in the highest regard if the occasion and circumstances allow. Daily affairs, both public and private, so hinder me that I have nothing under the press at the moment. I recently published a booklet on Christian Perfection addressed to the most powerful King of France, Heinrich II; I am sending it to you. However, I think you have long since seen my antithesis. Froschauer has now printed my Five Decades, compiled into one volume in folio format, and although it is now being reprinted for the second time, I have added nothing, taken away nothing, changed nothing, as many are accustomed to doing today. I do not know who you are or what your condition is; if it is not burdensome to you, let me know to whom I am writing, and continue to love me in the Lord. Live and farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 22, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Wolfgang Salet of Polucius, citizen of Chur, his esteemed friend. Chur.</p>
