      <p>S. D. It has indeed been a long time since I wrote to your kindness, reverend sir and esteemed lord, dearest brother; for I have also received nothing from you. But I attribute both to various and multiple affairs.</p>
      <p>The rumor that many honorable people are leaving and giving up their citizenship because of our ordinance is not true at all; I know of no one except the young man from Bonstetten who has given up his citizenship. Rather, that law against mercenary service is more and more approved by the best of people. I do see many everywhere looking towards ruin; but they will eventually reach their goal; it will be our duty to warn them in time; if they listen, we have won their souls, if not, they will reap what they have sown, as they say.</p>
      <p>And if the world were not blind, it would have seen within these last four years what the fruit of mercenary service is. If the morals of this age were not as they are, we would not be living in the last age.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord to deliver us from all evil. But what shall I write about German affairs? Since Easter, I have received no letters from Augsburg or elsewhere in Swabia; all is silent. Those who return to us from there tell various things, which, since they are uncertain, I do not think should be written. Some princes are now working to have everyone newly subscribe to the Augsburg Confession and its Apology and the four new articles, that is, those composed at the Frankfurt Diet, regarding what should be thought and taught about justification, the necessity of good works for salvation, the Lord's Supper, and adiaphora, etc. I hear that many among the Saxons strongly oppose these and are plotting something, whose leader is said to be Illyricus. I am grieved that the church is being torn apart by delicate and morose heads; but our ingratitude deserves this. I have written sermons, which you see, on some chapters of Jeremiah; I send a copy of these here.</p>
      <p>I am now writing ecclesiastical sermons for the feast days of our Lord and Redeemer; they will be published, God willing, at the upcoming Frankfurt fairs. I wish you good health.</p>
      <p>I am now in somewhat good health; for intolerable headaches and other unknown ailments trouble me more often than I would like. Farewell.</p>
      <p>May Lord Fuchs, Lord Jacob, Lord Funck, and all good people fare well. Zurich, July 3, 1558.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed Lord Ambrosius Blarer, pastor of the church in Biel/Bienne, his esteemed lord and dearest brother. Biel.</p>
