    <p xml:id="regest1">Will respond to the first letter when he returns Bullinger's treatise on predestination; Thomas [Blarer] has read it, now it is in the hands of [Konrad Zwick]. He is satisfied with the second letter concerning Alexander [Schmutz] and hopes to be able to prevent him from leaving his congregation. Fondly remembers [the spa treatment in] Urdorf. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I will respond to the previous letters, dearest brother, when I return your treatise on predestination, which will happen shortly. Thomas has read it, it is now in the hands of my brother, and then I will also receive it.</p>
      <p>In the later letters, I am very pleased with what concerns Alexander. When he recently returned from Strasbourg, I defeated all his arguments in front of the brothers. Whether he will comply, I do not know, but I will leave nothing undone. For I greatly detest the desertion of churches. More on other matters soon.</p>
      <p>Oh, how often I think of how well we lived in Urdorf. It will never be as good in my lifetime.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife and mother for me, yes, everyone. And may God be with you all.</p>
      <p>June 5, 1535.</p>
      <p>Johannes Zwick, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the church in Zurich, his well-deserving brother.</p>
