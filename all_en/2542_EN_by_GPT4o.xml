      <p>Jesus Christ for salvation. Immense thanks according to God are rightly owed to you, dearest Bullinger, not only by our present age but also by all Christian posterity for your pious labors and writings, by which you strive diligently to illustrate, promote, and defend the true and catholic religion to the best of your ability and with the gifts bestowed upon you. Among these, I am particularly pleased with the Decades of Sermons, the book On the Origin of Error, and the four books On Justification released this past year. Although I desired that these works be well-known to our people, even to the Germans, I took up the pen and, within two months, translated the four most recent books On Justification into our language, despite being in poor health and old. The vicar of our prince in Kassel, Justus Rauhe, has received a copy of this translation and will ensure that it is printed for the use of many. By this, we both hope to render you a service that will not be ungrateful. And certainly, if my age and health were still more intact, I would also undertake to translate your other books along with Peter Martyr's commentaries on the First Epistle to the Corinthians. However, since in great matters even the will is sufficient, it will be your task to ensure that others of more robust age and vigor not only follow my footsteps in translating the rest but also surpass them. For I have no doubt that many will be edified and gained from this; for you are not unaware that there are many great men in Germany who are little acquainted with the Latin language, for whom, in my judgment, this kind of translation could be more beneficial than the translation of Chrysostom and Cyprian, in whom a discerning reader will easily find little solid about true and imputed righteousness. Augustine was more worthy of translation, although he does not sufficiently distinguish between imputed righteousness and inherent righteousness, which you know better than I. These things, since a certain student of yours was with me, I decided to write to you, so that you might know that Lening, although very sick, is still not only surviving but also in complete agreement with you in all the tenets of purer religion and not forgetful of you. Farewell in Christ, dearest brother, and greet most dutifully on my behalf Pellican, Bibliander, Gwalther Rudolph, and all your fellow ministers. Given in Melsungen on the first of February in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Johannes Lening, minister of the divine word in Melsungen, Hesse.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and truly pious Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, his dearest brother in Christ.</p>
