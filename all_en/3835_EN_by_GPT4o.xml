      <p>Greetings and Best Wishes.</p>
      <p>If you and all your family, most illustrious and esteemed lord, are well, it is good; indeed, by divine grace, I am very well. Furthermore, most esteemed lord, you should know that I have a good master who treats me well and generously in all matters. Moreover, I diligently continue my studies to the best of my ability.</p>
      <p>Now, I have nothing more to write to you. I only ask that if my father sends any letters to you, you ensure they are delivered to me carefully. I also ask that you send the cloth I left with you and always keep me in your good graces, as you have done until now. I ask you to consider these silly letters of mine with fairness and kindness.</p>
      <p>That is enough for now.</p>
      <p>In my name, please give my dearest regards to your wife, Heinrich, your son, and the entire family. Farewell and live well, my dearest lord.</p>
      <p>Given in Basel from the house of my master, Mr. Lienhartt Smidt, in the year of our salvation 1559, on the 9th day of January.</p>
      <p>Your entirely devoted friend and like a dearest son, Johannes von Salis.</p>
      <p>Peter Alexius, my dearest comrade, who also studied in Zürich, sends you and all your supporters his very best wishes for health and happiness. To the most illustrious and excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his always greatly esteemed friend and lord.</p>
