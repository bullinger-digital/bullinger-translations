      <p>The letters you wrote to me on December 6th, along with those from our excellent Haller, have been delivered to me. I am glad that mine from October 24th, although somewhat lacking, have been presented to you. I wanted to make a journey to you for the sake of consultation, but partly the harshness of winter, partly the expeditions in which the world is now engaged, have prevented it; for it is easy for anyone to stumble with things standing as they are.</p>
      <p>Although I have postponed my journey until now, I have not yet changed my mind, and I will do what seemed desirable when I see an opportunity in the weather and the conditions of this age. Meanwhile, I wrote to you again on October 24th, and now for the third time. If you have not received any, I will think it is due to the negligence of the couriers; indeed, there was nothing of great importance in them. However, a certain honest man said he wrote something memorable to Lord Vadianus; if you have not yet received anything from him, you can inquire by letter whether he has recently received letters without a signature.</p>
      <p>Merchants certainly affirm that the Turk will invade Hungary next year and is already sending strong forces; however, the priests say this is a vain rumor and that it is more important to defeat the rebels in religion than to turn arms against the Turk, who will not come for a long time. Our/your troops are daily approaching closer to Piedmont. The cavalry, which was in Lower Rhaetia, came to Rutlingen a few days ago. War leaders are being secretly appointed, as many as can be had.</p>
      <p>In Saxony, despite the winter storms, there is warfare, so much so that it is in doubt which side has fought more successfully so far. It is reported that in the diocese of Bremen there are both infantry and cavalry forces ready to oppose Maurice of Saxony; hence, fear seems to appear among the timid people.</p>
      <p>The spirit of the eagle is perhaps greater than the strength of the body; you would indeed wonder how it can breathe the vital air from this little cave. God, in my judgment, wants to correct me in a marvelous and almost incomprehensible way, so that he may perhaps take a more unexpected revenge later. What you hint about persecution, I wish it were not too certain. It must be that cruel events occur, or all prophecies will be proven false; our sins, which have been abundant up to this day, deserve this. If out of a thousand there were one who had repented for past and still enduring calamities, the Lord would undoubtedly have mercy on us; but the world is so blind that it must utterly perish in its blindness. There are many things I would like to communicate with you, which writing avoids; however, I will make an effort for you to understand the rest someday.</p>
      <p>I am well with mine among the worshippers of Baal; I also see near Babylonian oppression at the door.</p>
      <p>May the Lord strengthen his own. Amen. December 24, 1550. Yours, Georg Laetus.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
