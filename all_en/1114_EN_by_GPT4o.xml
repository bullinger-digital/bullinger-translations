      <p>Greetings. Your intuition was correct, dearest Bullinger, that I am bedridden. Since the middle of November, I have been suffering from a severe pain in my right shoulder, as a sudden catarrh unexpectedly affected that part of my back. I feared it might be arthritis affecting the rest of my body; the disease was so severe.</p>
      <p>However, I believe that with my modest efforts, I have managed to counteract the ailment; for by rubbing and sweating, and also through scarifications and internal medicines, as well as by applying poultices to the shoulder, nothing was left undone to relieve the pain and to dilute the humor that had descended from the head. I do not remember ever being seized by a more severe torment, having previously only suffered from fevers, than the one I endured for the entire past month with a great aversion to food and drink. But by the grace of the Lord, the calmness of the fleeing disease is improving daily, except that the fingers of my right hand are trembling, which is why I dictated this letter to you, not trusting my hand, which would have testified to its trembling by poorly written characters. - But let me turn to your matters: know that your letters, as well as those of others you sent, were most welcome to me, and I was particularly delighted by the steadfastness of the Archbishop of Cologne, who built the pillar of his faith not on sand, like many, but on rock, from which no storm can dislodge him. The English quarrels somewhat upset me, as I see that such dissensions usually open a window for the enemies of Christ to their accustomed audacity, and I am not without hope that they will one day prevail among the discordant.</p>
      <p>Various rumors about new matters (as you know) are flying around; but since you desire it, I will report to you in order what has been faithfully written to me by great men. From Augsburg, a certain great and renowned man, related to my friend Hieronymus Sayler and not unfamiliar with the Emperor's court, wrote to me the day before in these words: "There is indeed news that the Emperor's Majesty is weak. Her Majesty would gladly see her son, the Prince, made Roman Emperor after her departure from this life. Therefore, King Maximilian is supposed to come here from Spain. It would be good if it came to such a thing, that the Spaniards would hold themselves better here and in the empire than has unfortunately been the case. You know, gracious sir, how things stand with Magdeburg. They have not yet wanted to submit to Her Majesty, and it is said that they are to be left not only with their privileges but also with their religion, as they have held it until now, etc. They also intend neither to approve the future council in Trent nor the Interim or the imperial declaration issued at the last diet. It has been planned to build some blockhouses in front of the city and to besiege and bring it to obedience in the spring. However, news came yesterday that Margrave Hans, the brother of the Elector of Berlin, has crossed the Elbe with 8,000 foot soldiers and 1,000 to 1,200 horsemen, intending to drive away all those who are now besieging Magdeburg, and it is expected that this might happen before the date of this writing.</p>
      <p>The matter will certainly have another foundation and perhaps more will follow from it than could have been expected so far. Fresh letters from Constantinople are said to be present in Hungary, and it is reported that the Turk is preparing both by sea through Africa and by land against Hungary, intending to wage a significant war in the coming spring and summer for both places. Whatever I learn daily, your lordship will be informed." - So much from Augsburg.</p>
      <p>A man of honor wrote this news as true to my son-in-law from Nuremberg: "Otherwise, I have nothing special to write to you at this time.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I am concerned that this coming year will be a very difficult one for trade here; for there is a great mortality in Saxony, Meissen, and Bohemia, and it is also burdened with war and famine. There are said to be about 20,000 foot soldiers and 2,000 cavalry in the Harz and the bishopric of Halberstadt, as well as in the land of Brunswick; they have no lord who wants to take them, and they carry white crosses on their banners with the inscription in golden letters: God our Lord. Such a force is coming to the aid of those in Magdeburg.</p>
      <p>They hope to have forced the troops besieging Magdeburg and intend to visit and root out all the priestly rabble of Judas Maurice and Hans of Brunswick. Amen, that it may happen. Count Ulrich of Mansfeld, Count Christoph of Oldenburg, Count of Heideck, Count Hans of Mansfeld, along with a chancellor of the city of Magdeburg, are with this group. I also think that the Schlicks and other expelled Bohemian lords will not be far from it. In short: it looks like a half Bundschuh; it might become complete by spring, etc. The people of Magdeburg are undaunted; they have about 2,000 soldiers inside and have not yet closed any gates against the enemy, nor have they broken their suburbs. Count Albrecht, along with his son Karl of Mansfeld, a banished count of Oettingen, and a count of Schwarzenburg, as well as many good soldiers who are undaunted, are also with them in the city. In short: it will only begin and start in the spring, and this war will be far-reaching. May Almighty God direct everything for the best according to His divine will. Amen."</p>
      <p>I will ensure that a copy of the canonical handwriting from Warsaw is faithfully delivered to where they reside, either through a brother from Poznań or through a cousin Hector from Kraków; for I will first understand from which place it can be more conveniently delivered; and if there is a response from those through whom I act, you will receive the whole matter at the earliest opportunity. I am returning the copies of the letters you sent; however, I could not send the booklet on the success of the Gospel in Hungary at present because some friends who took it from me have not yet returned it. I will send it, however, as soon as possible. - Musculus's letters caused pain, as I see a faithful man being agitated by so many temptations; for even last year, his family in Bern was afflicted by the same contagion, and I believe he did not escape this trouble when he was in Zurich, and when he was with us for a few days, his wife was bedridden with a severe fever. But thanks be to the Lord, who has preserved this truly Christian and learned man in good health until now and will not only preserve him but also give him the spirit to serve his churches as best as possible. If you ever write to Bern, please, I beg you, convey many greetings to him in my name. Farewell with yours in the Lord Jesus and love me as you always do. I would also like, either through you, if you have time, or through someone else among our friends, to know the date of the diets, if any have been announced now by the Swiss cantons or are about to be announced. You will do me a great favor if I receive certain news about this matter through you. St. Gallen, the nineteenth of December, in the year one thousand five hundred and fifty.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Church of Zurich, his most esteemed friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
