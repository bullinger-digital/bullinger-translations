      <p>The greatness of your outstanding and most illustrious virtues, (which, my most learned Bullinger, are so great and worthy of such a man, for which you are rightly admired, loved, and esteemed by all) was the reason why I wanted to direct this letter to you. You have published many good works so far, which have brought you immortal praise and immense benefit to the entire Church of Christ. As you have begun, continue; for you are by no means of such an advanced age that you cannot still bring forth and publish many other works. For if those things which you have forged from your Mars (mind) so far are pleasing to the most learned men, what, I ask, is to be hoped for from the later works, recently completed?</p>
      <p>Surely if those works are so greatly pleasing, these will be much more pleasing. For just as in a newly born man, the soul gradually exercises and performs greater and more illustrious works of life, so in a man not newly born, but born in old age, learning gradually brings forth more illustrious and distinguished works. But what need is there to add spurs to a running horse? For you know these things far better than I do, lest, as it is said, a pig should seem to teach Minerva.</p>
      <p>The presenter and giver of this letter is Lord Friedrich von Salis, a man of no small learning and piety, as you will be able to clearly perceive by his presence, and among our illustrious lords of the Three Leagues of the Rhaetians, he is of much authority. Since he has an only son and desires that he may become a learned man and be imbued with piety of character in every way, relying on your humanity and skill, he has decided to bring him there, where there is an abundance of all sciences and the most learned men, among whom you rightfully occupy the foremost place. Therefore, I earnestly commend his son to you, that you may have no less care for him in all matters pertaining to discipline and good governance, as if he were your dearest and only beloved son. For besides the fact that you will do a thing most pleasing to God and most worthy of yourself, you will do as much for his father as if you had offered him a most opulent kingdom. If conversation about me arises with him, he will most sufficiently recount to you about the progress and state of my affairs. In short: I am a foreigner, a refugee for the sake of pure evangelical doctrine, and very poor with my wife and children. Here I serve as a preacher of the word of God, and my community, which is always to be cherished, follows me with much love. And although I am not of the learning that this great burden and office requires, nevertheless the Lord, who never forsakes those who walk faithfully and diligently in their calling, so favors me with His kindness that I seem to myself to competently fulfill my duty and to improve more and more each day. It remains that you commend me to the heavenly Father in your prayers, that He may be a help to my ministry for its holy increase.</p>
      <p>Now assemblies will be held in our Rhaetia, in which many matters will be discussed, especially for the establishment of the preaching of the holy gospel and the administration of the holy sacraments according to the command and true institution of Christ in the Valtellina, which I hope will certainly happen; so eager and loving are our illustrious lords for true piety and the expansion of the glory of Christ. For there Satan, the most bitter enemy and adversary of the glory of Christ and the salvation of the faithful, tries with the help of his members to expel and drive away both the ministers and the gospel itself. But the Lord will crush his head and will be present with protection, favor, and help to His holy church and will be its defender and stronghold through all ages.</p>
      <p>What news I should write to you, I do not know, except for this alone: namely, the death of the son of that great Travers, a man truly a father of the fatherland (for he endured and did much for it, the old man sweated and froze), suffocated under the snow in the Alps with indeed great pity from all. His most illustrious father bears his death with such an undaunted spirit that he rather encourages all others (like another holy Job) to patience, than that he himself needs to be stirred to embrace it, a memorable example most worthy of imitation by all the faithful.</p>
      <p>I would indeed write more, but because I fear that I may be an impediment to you from the sacred study in which you are engaged day and night, I therefore lay down my pen here.</p>
      <p>Farewell, true ornament of our age both in learning and piety, and I commend myself very much to you, my lord, through Christ Jesus, our brother and lord, hoping that you will remember all those things which I described to you in past months.</p>
      <p>In Samaden, on the fifteenth day of January 1557. Servant of Jesus Christ and yours, Pietro von Bergamo.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord. In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
