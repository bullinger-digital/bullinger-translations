    <p xml:id="regest1">From Bullinger's letter dated April 27, it is gathered that [Johannes Bullinger] has overcome his severe illness. He is pleased to hear that his son [Hans Jakob Haab] is diligently studying. He hopes that the Reformation in England is being promoted selflessly, solely for the glory of God; he thanks for the news from England and Frankfurt. He knows from Johannes von Lupfen that an agreement was made in Frankfurt for 15 months and that scholars are to negotiate at a Reichstag in Regensburg about a unification in faith; the [Schmalkaldic] League is said to have promised the Emperor assistance against the Turks. [Johann von Weeze] has set out [from Frankfurt] to Lower Saxony to stop troops that have invaded the territory of the Dukes [Franz and Ernst III of Brunswick-]Lüneburg; Pastor Johannes Keller, the bearer of the letter, will be able to report more. There is nothing new from Lindau and Constance. He thanks Bullinger for the services rendered and for the booklet. He requests that [Keller] be allowed to participate in the [Spring] Synod; he is trustworthy. Bullinger should also pass the news on to Mayor [Diethelm] Röist. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Well-educated, pious, esteemed, honorable, dear lord and brother, may the grace of God through Christ Jesus, our Savior, be with you, along with my ready and willing service, etc. I have understood the entire content of your letter dated the 27th of April, and I am pleased to hear that the good, pious man and brother in Kappel has been somewhat relieved from his severe illness by the grace of God. May God give him strength in soul and body.</p>
      <p>I am also glad to hear that my son and the others are diligently studying. May God continue to grant His grace so that it all serves to His praise, etc.</p>
      <p>The fact that the word of God is breaking through so strongly in England is a joy to me; only that no carnal benefit is sought in it and that it serves solely to the honor of God. I have fully understood the other recent news from England and Frankfurt that has reached you, and especially the news from Frankfurt, as I have heard it as follows.</p>
      <p>Namely, on the past Monday, the 28th of April, I was in Rorschach for some councilors of the abbot of St. Gallen, concerning matters of my dear and trusted neighbors from Lindau.</p>
      <p>There I also met Count Hans von Lupfen, who is the bishop of Constance, who informed me that the current bishop of Constance, who is in Frankfurt on behalf of the imperial majesty, has written with his own hand that an agreement between the two parties has been made and concluded for 15 months. They are to engage excellent scholars on both sides and entrust them to seek and establish something of Christian appearance in matters of faith, and after the expiration of the 15 months, bring what they have found to the Reichstag in Regensburg. And if they can agree with each other, it is good; if not, further inspection should take place on the aforementioned day. And the princes and estates in the Christian league are said to have promised the emperor their assistance against the Turks.</p>
      <p>The aforementioned bishop has further written to him that he intends to go up to the bishopric soon. He says that the estates in Frankfurt have been ordered to ride quickly to the Lower Saxon lands to turn away several thousand soldiers who have invaded the land of the Duke of Lüneburg. This I can write and say truthfully. Otherwise, I cannot find anything further in this matter. However, I have heard of some articles that were also negotiated in Frankfurt, as this letter's bearer, Mr. Hans Keller, my dear brother and pastor, will further report to you.</p>
      <p>Nothing specific is coming from Lindau and Constance, etc. Further, dear lord and brother, I thank you most highly for the effort and work you have put into this and the previous letter. The booklet you sent me pleases me very much. Thank you also for that; it will be given to good lords and friends to read.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I earnestly request that you allow my aforementioned pastor in Rheineck and Thal to attend the synod and permit him to listen to and see your customs. You can be sure that he will not reveal anything, neither small nor large. He is also faithful, upright, and pious in teaching and life. I can give him this testimony with truth. I trust him with my office and household matters more than many others.</p>
      <p>Lastly, my request to you, Mayor Röist, is that if he does not report these things, to give notice. I would have gladly written to him as well; however, due to lack of time, I have had little leisure, as I have almost enough to do with daily occurring business.</p>
      <p>May Almighty God continue to enlighten you, to proceed in His work according to His pleasure. Greet Master Löwe, Mr. Caspar, the provost, Dr. Engelhart, and Vogt Lafenter, as well as your dear wife and children.</p>
      <p>Dated Rheineck, Sunday, the 4th of May in the year 1539. Your ever-faithful friend Hans Haab, Vogt in the Rhine Valley.</p>
      <p>To the pious, well-educated Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossmünster in the city of Zurich, my dear lord and brother.</p>
