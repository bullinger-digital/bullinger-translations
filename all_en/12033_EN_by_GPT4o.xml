    <p xml:id="regest1">Hopes that Blarer has received his last letter and the enclosed letters for others [Wolfgang Musculus, Sixt Birck, and Adam Bartholomäus] well and has forwarded them accordingly. Has nothing to report about the war [between Charles V and Francis I]; in recent days, an envoy of the Emperor from Burgundy, a brother-in-law of [Nicolas Perrenot de] Granvelle [François Bonvalot or Jean de Saint-Mauris], stayed in [Zürich]; he brought a peace proposal from the Emperor to the Swiss mediators between the Duchy and County of Burgundy, which even [Francis I] agreed to. Recommends the young Josua Bullinger, son of his brother [Hans], in the hope that he will find an apprenticeship [as a furrier in Konstanz] during the winter; asks [Blarer] to keep an eye on Josua. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>I eagerly await your letters, my most esteemed Ambrosius, for I believe mine have been delivered to you; I also hope that those letters of mine addressed to others have been faithfully forwarded by you. At present, I have nothing to write.</p>
      <p>We have no news about that unfortunate war. Indeed, in recent days, an envoy of the Emperor was here, a certain Burgundian, the son-in-law of Granvelle, bringing the Emperor's consent from the camp regarding the neutrality of the County and Duchy of Burgundy, for peace was made between them through the efforts of the Swiss; the French also agreed. That Burgundian asserted that there is great hope for peace and reconciliation.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant us His peace! I commend to you this young man, Josua Bullinger; he is the son of my brother. If he stays with you (I would very much wish that he finds a master with you, with whom he could work this winter), I ask you to advise and correct him, so that he does not become arrogant in the manner of young men. I also pray that you inform me of how he conducts himself; you will be doing me a great favor.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with all yours.</p>
      <p>September 15, in the year 44.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, his singular and incomparable brother. Konstanz.</p>
