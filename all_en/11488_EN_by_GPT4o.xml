    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger's concerns regarding the character of Melchior [Wirz] seem to him to be unfounded, yet he himself can care too little about him. Thanks for Bullinger's commentary on Paul's letters, which he reads with great benefit. Has difficulty following Zwingli's profound thoughts in his book "De providentia [dei]" and would like to know what Bullinger and Leo [Jud] think about it.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Regarding Melchior, whom you feared might have a somewhat wild nature, I assure you to be at ease; either he deceives me greatly, or he is an excellent young man. He is diligently applying himself to learning and is fervent in his studies, and there is no doubt that he will make outstanding progress. My only regret is that I cannot fulfill my duty sufficiently.</p>
      <p>I am now reading your works, in which you have successfully illuminated Paul's discussions, and I cannot easily express how eagerly I do so, and I am indeed most grateful to you; for I feel that I am greatly aided by your interpretations.</p>
      <p>The Lord is to be praised with eternal praises, for He has deemed our age worthy to be illuminated by this heavenly light.</p>
      <p>I have already at some point looked into our Zwingli's book on providence, and I do not know whether I have the spirit to follow the sublimity of that hero through these depths. I wish to hear your opinion on the writing first, and you will do me a great favor if you write it down when you have time, and even more so if you also indicate the judgment of our Leo on the same matter.</p>
      <p>Farewell now and love me.</p>
      <p>Your Gryn√§us.</p>
      <p>To his lord Heinrich Bullinger, friend and patron.</p>
