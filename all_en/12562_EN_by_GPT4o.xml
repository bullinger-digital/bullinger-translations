    <p xml:id="regest1">[Ludwig von] Reischach received the news that [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse will attack Würzburg on his route and perhaps also Bamberg afterwards.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Today, a ship with a small flag is traveling on the Rhine to Strasbourg. For eight days now, a large number of soldiers have been sent there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Many in [Basel] believe that there has been too much delay in launching an attack [against Emperor Charles V.], that he forbids his [captains] from fighting and waits until a large [force] is at his disposal. Through a military ruse, he has already prevented the [Schmalkaldic League] from advancing into the Adige Valley. They should learn from this to act more wisely against him, for in his cunning, he has already managed to gather a large number of weapons.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The Danish [King Christian III.] and [Elector John Frederick I of] Saxony are securing the territory left behind by the Landgrave.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Myconius very much approves of the announced meeting [of the Protestant city cantons]! He has heard troubling things about the Five Places, which are said to have acted inappropriately. May the [city cantons] do the right thing!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Bullinger has already written for the second time about the wheat supply.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- [PS.:] In [Basel], it is said that the Turk is coming to teach the Emperor a lesson.</p>

      <p>S. I have nothing except that it is certainly written that Reischach will attack Würzburg on his journey, and perhaps afterwards Bamberg.</p>

      <p>Today, a ship with a small flag is traveling on the Rhine to Strasbourg, and for eight days now, a large number of soldiers have been sent there.</p>

      <p>There is frequent talk here among the good people that there has been too much delay in attacking the enemy, and that Charles is preventing his men from resisting anywhere until a large force can gather. By a stratagem, he has brought back our soldiers from the territory of the Adige Valley, which our people should consider, so that they learn to counteract the cunning one. This situation has resulted in such a large number of weapons already being gathered.</p>

      <p>About the Dane and the Saxon, nothing except that through them, the Landgrave is secure behind him.</p>

      <p>I thank the Lord for the announced meeting. For I had heard things that troubled me somewhat. The Five Places are acting in a way that is not appropriate. May our people act in a way that is appropriate! The Lord will be with those who act rightly. Your plan is pleasing. May the Lord Jesus be present, so that what His spirit promises may come to pass. He will fulfill the will of those who fear Him and will hear their prayers and save them!</p>

      <p>Farewell in Christ, who protects both His word and His church from evil. In Basel, hastily, July 27, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Os. Myco.</p>

      <p>Here the saying goes: "Let them do it, the Turk is coming here and wants to help the Emperor, meaning, they will be taught (a lesson)."</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, my brother in the Lord, to be respected.</p>
