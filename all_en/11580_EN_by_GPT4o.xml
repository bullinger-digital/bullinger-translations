    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for answering his questions and for the books sent along; since occasional reading of Augustine and other Church Fathers has not brought him clarity on the question of the creatureliness of Christ, Vadian's writings against Schwenckfeld are very welcome to him. He agrees with Bullinger on the symbolic interpretation of the Lord's Supper, which, however, is opposed [in Württemberg]; this keeps him from participating in the communion, yet he fears that this might offend the common people and give support to the opponents of the Gospel. He hopes that Bullinger's advice will free him from this conflict of conscience; he promises to treat the sent copy confidentially and asks for a recommendation to Vadian. Greetings; recommendation from his cousin [Georg Müller] and family.</p>

      <p>Greetings in Christ.</p>
      <p>Dearest brother, I received your letters, which you sent to me, along with the books, and they are not only most delightful to me but also the most certain witnesses of your love for me. You have done me a great favor by responding so wisely and piously to my questions; for, as your letters teach me, I am of the mind that human acuteness, which is foolishness in respect to this, should not investigate beyond the manifest simplicity of Scripture. However, since the debate about how Christ is a creature is now being stirred among many and in places where it seems to me forbidden to contend about such matters, it has caused me some concern to investigate this matter. I have seen Saint Augustine and some holy fathers, as much as public duties allowed.</p>
      <p>I found certain passages, which, to be honest, I do not understand even today, and some seem to be able to be turned to either side. Therefore, Vadian's writings against Schwenckfeld are most welcome, and as much as I can steal from the administration of the republic in my spare hours, I will spend on comparing and judging the opinions of both, and in this matter, I will fix my aim there, to pass over what is not of salvation and faith (yet not unknown) and observe the rest. But without you as interpreter and judge, I will not fix my foot even a nail's breadth. It cannot be said - if the mill, to which I am called and bound for the republic, would allow - how much I delight in examining each opinion of sacred matters, even those still erring, and by what arguments they have been refuted, not for the sake of contention, but so that each is not entirely unknown. Therefore, in the matter of the Eucharist, you lead me to your doctrines in Paul to the Corinthians; for there I have been, I am engaged, and I handle with my hands you with Paul, etc. Since you agree with the holy fathers, especially Augustine, I stand in that observation and will not deny it while the spirit governs these limbs: The symbolic supper is, the bread is divine in respect to Jesus instituting his commemoration of Christ; Christ is present and is eaten in spirit in the manner of this sacrament, sitting at the right hand of God the Father, from where he will come to judge all flesh.</p>
      <p>I know what communion Christ wants between us through the observance of his testament, and that no Christian should pass over that common thanksgiving and its symbolic sign. However, I am repelled here from the communion of our people by the inept, as it seems to me, doctrine of the Eucharist. They anathematize, publicly condemn, urge, and want to be believed that the natural and essential body of Christ is present, mixing the spiritual eating with the natural so barbarously, not to say impiously, that few sheep know what they eat and what eating Christ brings. Now I, since I think differently and with you, and they openly condemn us, I ask you to advise whether it is permissible for me, with my faith intact, to observe the communion of the Eucharist with our people; for I would also like to commemorate my Redeemer and testify gratitude for his passion in public, lest it seem that his institution displeases me.</p>
      <p>I know, indeed, that when the use of the Eucharist is frequently observed according to our rites and is neglected by me, who presides over the republic, how much the inept and common people are offended, and also occasion is given to those who have not yet embraced the gospel and still cling to the papistic scene to impose on the doctrine of the gospel.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, dearest brother, since it is not permissible to leave my calling rashly, instruct and advise how I can free my conscience from this heavy stone, whether I should receive the bread of Christ from those ministers or not; for I greatly rejoice that I have found you as a brother and Christian teacher in this matter. Moreover, the booklet you sent me under the condition will be observed by my private hands, and you will never desire my faith in you. Business and the haste of the archives prevent me from writing more. I wish, if it can be done in any way, to be recommended by you to Vadian; for nothing delights me more than to be inscribed in the register of such learned men.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with your wife and most delightful children, and although you yourself have my cousin, your godfather, recommended to you, I again commend him to you with his wife and daughter, and if he seems to stray from the way of Christ, recall him and show the true path that leads to salvation.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Given hastily, June 22, 1541.</p>
      <p>Nikolaus Müller, known as Maier.</p>
