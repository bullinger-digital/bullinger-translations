      <p>Greetings. I can easily guess the reason why you do not respond. You fear that something bad might happen as a result, perhaps frightened by an example. However, in the meantime, while you remain silent, believe me, you only increase the suspicion that the situation is much worse. Therefore, if you do not think it appropriate to write about this, at least inform me about Bucer's actions. Every delay here is indeed serious. Capito was here in the meantime, although only for one night. I do not know what the domestic matters were. He said that other matters called him home. For there are seventeen companions besides other nobility, who are stirring up some disputes concerning the canons with the people of Strasbourg. For this reason, he wishes that Bucer would hurry. We held a synod. We always found the lords to be compliant. May God grant that they remain so.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all the brothers. Write back, whatever it may be. For I cannot bear to be without your letters any longer.</p>
      <p>Basel, May 13, 1533.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the learned and pious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, venerable friend. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
