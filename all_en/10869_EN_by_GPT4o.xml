      <p>Greetings, most learned Bullinger.</p>
      <p>The crowd of soldiers and horsemen, namely pious men, is so overwhelming and demanding that I can scarcely breathe, let alone write to you as I would like and wish. Therefore, please take my silence and brief greeting in good part, you who are most excellent in integrity and learning.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, ensure that what has come out of your workshop is received by me with this Peter now known to you, along with those of your other colleagues.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and may Christ continue to accomplish in you what He has begun for His praise and glory and for the advancement and adornment of His church. Farewell with all yours and your holy church. We pray for you in return.</p>
      <p>On the very day of Ascension in the year etc. 36.</p>
      <p>Bartholom√§us, your disciple.</p>
      <p>To the man most outstanding in piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, the most praiseworthy bishop of the Zurich church, his most honorable teacher.</p>
