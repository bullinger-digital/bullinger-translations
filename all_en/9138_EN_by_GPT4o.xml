      <p>May the almighty God grant you, Susanna, the children, and your entire household a good, fortunate, and healthy year. I thank you most kindly for your splendid good wishes for the New Year; I will, where I can, repay it. To the servant, I have given a French franc and 4 Constance batzen for bringing the fish, and 2 Constance batzen for the New Year. We have planned to send Rudolf KÃ¶rner, our brother-in-law, to you tomorrow, God willing, so that he may assist you during this festival. By then, God willing, I will write you more. In haste.</p>
      <p>Dated December 23, 1572.</p>
      <p>God be with you.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
