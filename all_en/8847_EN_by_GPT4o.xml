      <p>God be with us all. Beloved son, I am writing to you this time primarily because Heinrich has informed you of my illness. It is no less than that I have been weak and unwell for a while. But on Thursday night or towards the night, it suddenly and violently overcame me, so that I cried the whole night and had unspeakable pain, etc. However, now it has become better again due to the easing of the pain; I hope it will get better and better, although I always submit to God's will in all things. He will make everything right, and I am therefore content; for it is quite well with me, that with God's help I want to preach myself tomorrow.</p>
      <p>Therefore, know that God has gladdened J. Hansen and joyfully delivered [Mrs.] Dorothea and given them a son; God be praised.</p>
      <p>Heinrich has written to you about the matter in the Grisons. Our gracious lords have sent their envoys up there; they believe it will be resolved and very little will come of the matter, as is usually the case with the common man's uproar. It is said that there were about 6000 well-armed men; they are now said to have withdrawn. From Lyon, it is written that an eternal peace has been proclaimed between France and England and that the marriage between Navarre and the king's sister has been concluded and that it is peaceful and well in France. That is the summary; I cannot write more.</p>
      <p>Also know that our dear sister, the pious, virtuous Susanna, wife of our brother-in-law Felix, has been called by God from this misery.</p>
      <p>She was a virtuous, honorable woman; therefore, it has gone badly for brother-in-law Felix; but since she was constantly ill, God has also done well by her. Tonight around 4, she will be carried to the grave. May God grant us all His grace and, in His time, eternal salvation. Greet Susanna and the children and all of us, etc.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, Saturday, March 29, 1572. Greet J. Hansen Peyer for me; whatever I could do for him, I would be willing; he should use the water, as I have written to you, always on the 3rd or 4th day.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I thank you for the songs Heinrich sent.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
