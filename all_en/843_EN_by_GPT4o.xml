      <p>The Lord and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ grant you, our dearest brothers, under this sad spectacle of affairs, the most ample gifts of the spirit of wisdom and understanding, counsel and strength for the edification of His church and our consolation with you, so that we may feel the same with you, worship God with one spirit, and persist in the confession of simple truth to the glory of the Lord's name. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your most desired letters, dearest brothers in Christ, have indeed filled us with great joy, as they have provided us with a most immediate outline of your sincere mind towards us, and have explained your judgment regarding our reasons under these difficulties and the various twists of differing opinions, so that we should not undergo any change in our situation; for we consider this a great comfort to us amidst these laborious and perilous struggles. But seeing that our plan is also approved by the best churches, we do not claim it as ours, except insofar as it falls to our ministry according to God's immutable decree (by which He has willed from eternity to establish, govern, and preserve His church by His word and the counsel of His spirit), so that in the preservation of doctrine, order, and discipline, we do not at all follow the judgment of human wisdom or reason. Far be it from us to borrow anything from the synagogue of Satan with profane counsels or impious practices for our church (which we know has been sanctified by Christ with His blood). For just as there is no agreement between Christ and Belial, so there should be none between Christians and the fabricators of perverse doctrines. This, dearest brothers, is our thought; we seek and strive for this, that we may be a good fragrance of Christ to our God, but an intolerable stench to Satan and his entire kingdom, so that if he cannot endure us as guests and fellow citizens in this world, over which he otherwise strives to rejoice in his rule, we know that in our Father's house many mansions are prepared, to which Christ our Lord has obtained full possession for us by His death and glorious resurrection, having blotted out the handwriting of sin.</p>
      <p>This is our consolation in these furies of Satan, that although our name is now hateful to the wise of the world and we are called disturbers of public peace, stiff-necked, headstrong, and even by our own people, because we do not wish to mix sacred things with profane, that is, to join Christ with Belial, which our wise ones call serving the times and winking at small things, lest the whole ministry collapse, avoiding Caesar's wrath, lest the entire republic be confused and destroyed. The Anabaptists are remarkable, for they thus restrain Satan with his most impious practices by imposing the name of adiaphora (indifferent things), so that they may more securely boast in our light and play in our simulation and inconstancy. Our people have attempted to cut off this most wicked apostasy from Caesar's Interim and impose it on us. But, oh brothers, the Lord Jesus has preserved us by His kindness, whom the Father has therefore appointed as king over His holy mountain Zion, to keep it from evil. With this king remaining, we too shall remain by the same grace, which our king has obtained for us with His death before the Father. Therefore, dearest brothers, we still stand in our station, although the magistrates have forbidden us to preach from the pulpit, indeed have sometimes banned us from their region. Meanwhile, we remain and will remain in the name of the Lord until they eject us by force. The church is kept closed, the bells are not rung; but the church is opened on Sundays around ten for the baptism of children and the joining of brides with grooms. So also on Tuesdays and Fridays. Here we strive to make up for the losses of public sermons to the church at certain hours, and we extend admonitions and teaching on the ministry of baptism into a somewhat longer sermon, inserting the epistle and gospel. For thus it is necessary to be cunning with the foxes. Indeed, under this pretext, we sometimes steal a little more time, so that we may also celebrate the supper. For when we are in the church, there is no one to order us to leave, even if it displeases the magistrates that we extend our admonitions too much, since they wish there to be a rumor in Caesar's court that the preachers have been deprived of their ministry. Here we think we must be vigilant, not attending to what Caesar's threats or favor can do, but what our Lord, the sole shepherd of His church, wills.</p>
      <p>Thus, dearest brothers, the good God still preserves our church and us in a sufficiently happy course of the word, indeed in a wonderful manner beyond all counsel and expectation of the magistrates. They have ordered our dearest and most learned superintendent Johannes a Lasco to leave, who has now wintered in Bremen. Therefore, the magistrates have sent to call a superintendent and ministers of the word from elsewhere, namely such as are willing to accept the most confused mixture, which our people (as you have seen) have concocted from the broth of Caesar's Interim. But no one comes forth; perhaps they fear lest they find us carrying hay on our horns. Yet we wish to harm no one or to be envied by our people, but only to preserve the little sheep of Christ our Lord, which we have undertaken to feed, from wolves and to feed them with the ministry of the word and sacraments.</p>
      <p>We write these things, brothers, about our station preserved thus far, so that you may rejoice with us and pray to God, indeed encourage your church to pray, that our shepherd Jesus Christ may mercifully preserve us further, so that by His example we may expose ourselves and all our things for the salvation and edification of His church. We are always mindful of you in our prayers. Farewell, dearest brothers, and watch with us, that in silence and hope our strength may be shown. Emden, the day before Matthias, in the year 50.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your fraternity, Thomas Bramius, Gellius Epipedius Faber, Hermannus Brassius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and vigilant dispensers of the church of Christ, brothers and doctors of the church of ZÃ¼rich, most esteemed lords and brothers in Christ.</p>
      <p>Hans Hypocras.</p>
