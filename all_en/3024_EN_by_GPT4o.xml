      <p>The business of the Glareans greatly concerns me, because the Five Cantons do not seem to be at rest until their wishes are satisfied, and the excellent men flatter themselves too much, thinking that the offense of consenting to erect the idol of the mass is so slight that it may be admitted without coercion. However, the Lord, who has set boundaries for the sea, also knows how to turn our evils to the glory of His name. The people of Geneva and Bern recently negotiated over certain controversial articles; but what has been accomplished is unknown. The Margrave, our neighbor, is progressing in reforming the churches, although he has not yet reached us.</p>
      <p>Maximilian is said to have restored the evangelical preachers expelled from Bohemia by his father Ferdinand. If this is true, the Austrians will more easily obtain their wishes. He also promised to act with his brother-in-law ALBERT of Bavaria, so that he may agree on religion with the other princes of Germany. A most learned and pious man, Löscher, writes to me from Ingolstadt that the Lord's Supper was celebrated under both kinds in 8 or 9 parishes with great popular attendance and applause, and that the nobility is continuously urging reformation, opposed by 3 of the prince's counselors; but they will labor in vain against such a strong and consenting zeal of the nobility. Albert the Margrave is said to be gravely ill, which is said to cause the bishops to mourn deeply. I am sending the book of Marsilius of Padua.</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours. Basel, September 26, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your [Simon] Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most esteemed and beloved lord and brother.</p>
