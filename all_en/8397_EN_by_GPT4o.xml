      <p> Greetings. I responded to your previous letters in the past days, most esteemed lord and father, and I believe I have satisfied you. Today, I also received your latest letters through this messenger, for which I likewise give you great thanks. However, I do not have anything to respond to them with at the moment. Meanwhile, nothing has happened here that is worth writing about. From France, only this: uncertain rumors are circulating that the king has fathered an illegitimate child and that the child's mother has also given birth; however, it is not clear who fathered this child, except that it is commonly believed that Cardinal Lorraine is the father. But I do not know how certain these things are, although I have heard them from reputable persons who have come from Savoy in recent days. In Rouen, it is said that a sedition has been caused by the papists and the peace has been disrupted; the admiral has received power from the king to punish them. But I sell these rumors at the price I bought them. It is also said that the Swiss have been dismissed, some from Fribourg have returned, and the rest will follow within two days. These are the things I have now. I am very saddened by the dissension among the ministers of Chur; who, I ask, is this Gantner? </p>
      <p> In Basel, things are not going well, until it goes as it does here. By God's grace, matters have been well arranged here once again; the salt cannot stand in the air here. More next time. </p>
      <p> Diligent greetings to you from Consul Steiger, as well as from Manuel, Hagenbuch, my father-in-law, and the entire KÃ¼ngsfeld cohort. Tomorrow, our Zehender will set out for Interlaken with his entourage; he also sends his greetings to you with all his people. I wrote recently about Felix, your nephew. I do not want his father to send me anything except what I have spent for him and what is contained in the schedule; for the rest, I have long been abundantly satisfied by all of you, and I am glad that at least I understand that my efforts have not been ungrateful to you. Please convey this to him; for he has solicited me with private letters; and since, as you know, I am more reluctant to write, I wanted to add these things to yours. </p>
      <p> Greet him in my name and with him all of yours. Bern, October 6, 1570. </p>
      <p> Your always, Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> I am sending you a booklet by our Aretus, in which you will see what he writes about ubiquity; I also hope that he will extort that treatise on the Lord's Supper from us/you? to commit it to the press. However, I am sending this on the condition that, when I send you another copy, this one will be returned to me because my name is inscribed on it; I could not obtain another. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot. </p>
      <p> M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich. </p>
