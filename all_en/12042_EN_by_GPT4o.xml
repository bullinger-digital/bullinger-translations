    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for Bullinger's letter delivered by [Heinrich] Falkner from June [not received] and for his writing against [Johannes] Cochläus [„Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio“; HBBibl I 159]; also thanks for Bullinger's exhortation to a godly life not solely devoted to worldly affairs in his second letter delivered by Froschauer [not received]. Even though he mostly works at home in Strasbourg and travels little, his work indeed occupies him greatly; nevertheless, he managed last winter to read the Bible sent by Bullinger [„Biblia sacrosancta“; BZD C 328?] up to the New Testament. Among other things, he realized that the prophets are also critical of merchants; Bullinger should pray for him and continue to admonish him. He also thanks for the book by Bullinger delivered by Froschauer [„Antiquissima fides“; HBBibl I 103], which he found upon his return; it is very popular among his evangelical-minded compatriots and was also translated into English [1541] by Miles Coverdale [HBBibl I 104], although he himself prefers the Latin version; however, he regrets that he cannot reciprocate Bullinger's generosity. His wife [Anna Hilles] thanks for the coin sent by Bullinger, a symbol of unity. The letter bearer John [Burcher] [or Butler?] will report any news from England to Bullinger better than he can do in writing; he sends twelve Italian crowns for the poor exiles for the New Year. Greetings, also to Theodor [Bibliander], [Konrad] Pellikan, [Kaspar] Megander, and Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler].</p>

      <p>Praise be to God! Greetings and peace from the Lord! Your letter dated June, esteemed and beloved in Christ, I received through Falkner at our fair here, and I am most grateful to you for your response to Cochläus's pamphlet, which you gifted me: I read it in August, and it greatly confirmed me in the true religion of our Lord and Savior. I also feel deeply indebted to your piety for having deemed me worthy of admonition for the second time in your recent letters through Mr. Froschauer, to use the world in such a way that I do not lose the heavenly; to love the Lord God above all and not to immerse myself too much in perishable things, business, and money. Now I know that the love of Christ remains in you because you keep His commandment, as befits a good shepherd. "If your brother," says the Lord, "sins against you," etc. Do not doubt, beloved teacher, that the more you remind me of my duty or reproach my negligence, the more I will value you and love you sincerely. I confess that I am occupied with various and perhaps too many business dealings; however, I am rarely absent from home except for the Frankfurt fairs: hence, I devote myself to sacred reading less often than I desire because I have no servant: I conduct almost all my business alone, especially here in Strasbourg; I am also almost always occupied with writing letters and accounts, and such matters. Nevertheless, last winter, by divine grace, I read the entire Holy Bible, which you gave me, except for the New Testament, with as much diligence as I could. From this holy reading, if nothing more, I gained this benefit, that when the prophets, according to your version, wanted to name a deceiver or impostor, they called him a merchant. From this, I learn, as you also say, that commerce is a dangerous and slippery matter, in which I can quickly fall: would that I had not often fallen! Furthermore, from that reading, I learned repentance. You, my lord, help me with your prayers as well as with those most pious and frequent timely admonitions; which indeed (as you write) you do for the duty of a friend and brother, and for my salvation: for this, God will reward you on that day! Amen.</p>
      <p>As for the rest, I received your book, which you recently sent me through Mr. Froschauer, from my wife here after my return, and as soon as I have time, God willing, I will read it. It indeed receives much praise from our compatriots who favor the gospel: for our Michael (I speak of Miles Coverdale) made that book English immediately after my arrival from England in these parts; however, I delight more in the Latin reading. For that book, I also owe you great thanks: but I regret that you always send me gifts, while I have nothing good here to return to your charity. My wife also thanks you (as I do not doubt you heard from Falkner) for that old coin, a symbol of unity. Any news from England, if there are any, will be much better reported to you by our John, the bearer of this letter, than I can describe to you with my most barbarous and, as I fear, inappropriate style. He will also bring with him twelve Italian crowns enclosed in these my letters for the poor exiles. I pray you distribute them as the year approaches, as you have the opportunity; and pray to the Lord for me, that He may kindly regard this small offering, and have mercy on us all. Amen. You will not disdain to greet Mr. Theodor, Mr. Pellikan, Mr. Megander, and the rest of your both pious and most learned men in my name. My wife greets you along with your most pious wife, to whom I also ask you to convey my greetings. And may the Lord Jesus, our hope, grant you to continue fulfilling your ministry to the end; so that when He appears, the Prince of shepherds, you may carry away the unfading crown of glory. Amen. Strasbourg, September 26, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, R. HILLES.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher of the church of Zurich, and especially esteemed by me, in Zurich.</p>
