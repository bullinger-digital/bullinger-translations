      <p>Greetings. For a long time, I have received no letters from your kindness.</p>
      <p>And I am surprised.</p>
      <p>Especially amidst such varied and almost sad rumors about the affairs of France.</p>
      <p>Indeed, some things are written by friends: but they are quite uncertain. Yours are always certain.</p>
      <p>I would therefore wish, if it is allowed through the occupations with which I know you are covered and almost overwhelmed, to understand the state of France from your letters. Our neighbors ([who] recently again, if you do not know, sent 8 banners to Burgundy) continually boast of victories and cities recovered and the restoration of papism throughout France.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord, that He does not forsake us because of ingratitude, and that He does not grant the adversaries the insolence of exulting in impiety perpetually. Since you recently indicated that you were unaware that the book of Stancarus was sent to you by me, I suspect that my letters attached to the book were not delivered to you. For in these, I was indicating that I was sending the book.</p>
      <p>I was adding that the brothers in Poland are asking us to respond to something. Now I am sending you the letters of Gregorius Paulus, so that you may also understand from these what they are asking.</p>
      <p>Return them after reading, along with their confession of faith, which I am also now sending. We received it from Frankfurt without any letters, just as you see.</p>
      <p>It would be useful if you at least responded to Stancarus.</p>
      <p>You know, I suppose, that Brentius has published a verbose and utterly inept book against Martyr and me, to say nothing else, which he titles: On the Majesty of Our Lord Jesus Christ at the Right Hand of God, and on the True Presence of His Body and Blood in the Supper. In this, he differs in no way from the ravings of Schwenkfeld and from the impious doctrine of Eutyches.</p>
      <p>For he proclaims the glory of Christ's body in heaven and the personal union of natures in such a way as to nullify the property of the true body of Christ. It is amazing if so many learned men in the churches of Christ are going to overlook this audacity of this man.</p>
      <p>He vehemently criticizes the saying of Beza and ours: As high as heaven is from the earth, so far is the true body of the Lord from the supper. But perhaps you have seen the book.</p>
      <p>At the end, a certain Alpheus Valesianus, a fictitious man, writes to me, and objects to me your interpretation from the commentary on Ephesians about the right hand of God, etc. However, since I have decided to respond to him entirely, I ask you what I might be able to respond to him regarding your objection. For I know that you feel with us, and do not act with them, etc.</p>
      <p>The Landgrave recently sent me letters, in which he indicates that the princes will reject the Council of Trent at the upcoming Frankfurt assembly. He also sent a book to be offered to the Emperor in which they refuse.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord, that He may strengthen them.</p>
      <p>Farewell together with all the brothers and fellow ministers.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you with yours.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe for us for a long time.</p>
      <p>What our people have accomplished with the Milanese, the courier here, I believe, brings. We have a friend in the Milanese fortress: to him, Mr. Gessner wrote and recommended the cause of the prisoner.</p>
      <p>You will understand what he replied from these enclosed letters. Be careful not to disclose the name to anyone.</p>
      <p>However, return the letters along with these enclosed ones. Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Mr. Gessner greets you. October 18, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, faithful pastor of the church of Geneva, my esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
