      <p>Greetings. Our people have elected Onophrius as the overseer; but he has not yet been confirmed by the council of Bern, and our dean and Nicholas of Bern have diligently worked to prevent his confirmation. The dean opposes me because of Joachim, whom he wanted to defend against justice and fairness, even by force and deceitful means. But when I summoned him to court and won (I was compelled to do so), our council dismissed him, and since the dean now understands that the council favors me and that I support Onophrius, if it were up to him, he would want to impose another on me, with whom I would also have to contend. Therefore, I fear, because our people defend me and have elected Onophrius, that if he goes to Bern, Nicholas might disturb him with troublesome questions; for he is entirely devoted to the dean. Therefore, most kind Bullinger, I ask you again and again to support the young man, to recommend him to Mr. Haller, so that they may not wish to be too harsh in examining him. His teacher Frisius will give him a testimony before you, and I will consider this a benefit conferred upon me.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your most honorable family, whom may the best and greatest God keep safe for you, and may He preserve you for us and the church, safe and flourishing for a long time.</p>
      <p>Brugg, September 29, 1549.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Michael Toxites.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man of true piety and all learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful churchman of Zurich, his master and most esteemed friend.</p>
