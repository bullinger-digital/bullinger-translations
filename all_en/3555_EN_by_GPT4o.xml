      <p>Greetings. If, after I last wrote to you, anything new had happened that was worthy of your attention, I certainly would not have neglected the habit of writing for such a long time. For regarding German affairs and the acts of the Frankfurt Diet, I think you have more certain information than I do, and I should rather expect these things from you. The monarchs are preparing for war with great force on both sides; but nothing has yet been undertaken.</p>
      <p>There was some mention of peace with a messenger sent by Caraffa (who was with the Spaniard) to the king, to inquire about his willingness for peace. The king would then make a decision and respond when the Spaniard had declared himself.</p>
      <p>It is certainly known that these princes do not approve of Caraffa as a mediator and interpreter of peace, and much less could the matter be accomplished through him than perhaps it will be able to be in the future, God willing, in his absence. I hope to have Matth√§us Coignet as a successor, a man very friendly to both you and me. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Solothurn, April 7th.</p>
      <p>Yours, St. Laurentius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished theologian, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, etc.</p>
