      <p>Relying on your singular kindness, most illustrious Lord Bullinger, I wanted to send you this brief letter and briefly explain what I wish. Recently, when I was with my people in your city of Zürich, nothing could have been more pleasing to me in that place than the acquaintance, however slight, that I made with the most eminent and excellent men of that place, namely with you, with Lord Pellican and Lord Bibliander. I had in mind to request some testimony from you, which I neglected at that time due to the excessive haste of the journey. Therefore, at this time, I earnestly ask you to request a small note in my name from Lord Pellican and Lord Bibliander and to add yours as well. If it is troublesome to write letters, I will be content if they send a certain passage of scripture with a brief explanation written in their own hand. Nothing could ever be more pleasing to me from you, and I will hold it in perpetual memory as long as God grants me life. I believe you will not doubt my name, as you diligently noted it in my lodging when we were with you. Please consider this letter, excellent man, with favor. If I see that it has been acceptable to you, I will write longer and more frequent letters. I earnestly request that you send a response to Lord Münster, who, I believe, can more easily and quickly arrange it from Basel than from your place.</p>
      <p>Farewell and respectfully greet those distinguished men, Lord Pellican and Lord Bibliander, in my name. Wittenberg, August 27, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erhard von Kunheim.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and upright man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zürich, his most dear lord and friend, to his own hands.</p>
