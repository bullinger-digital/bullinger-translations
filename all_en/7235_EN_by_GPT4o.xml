      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you a few days ago through Bullinger of Bruges, your relative, and indeed, what I wrote then is still confirmed with us, except for the fact that the King of Spain has landed in Flanders; however, it is affirmed that he will come and the King of France along with his mother will go to him. We have not received anything from Geneva these days; they could have certain information about these matters, and it is strange to us that they write nothing. Therefore, I anxiously await letters both from them and from you. The Duke of Savoy is still said to be in Thonon and Ripaille. Some people from Thonon asked him for the restoration of the mass; to whom he himself gravely replied that if they want to hear masses, they should go to other places where it is celebrated; he wants to keep what he promised to the Bernese lords. He also granted the ministers a consistory and some other things that pertain to the discipline and governance of the church. Meanwhile, we hear that he secretly held a mass for himself in the castle of Thonon. I have nothing else now. As for this Muralto of ours, his affairs have now been brought to an end. Lord von Mülinen did not want to respond to your consul, because he had discovered from some intercepted letters that the matter had already been settled between him and his daughter; he therefore waited until she returned to Gex, where she had dealt with the prefect of that place, Anton Tillyer. After she came, he wanted to know the whole matter; then she confessed that she had promised him her faith; thus she was expelled from her paternal home, and the matter came to the consistory. There, since she confessed plainly without any exception that she had married him and moreover also wanted to have him, it was indicated that the marriage should be considered valid, but if the girl's father wanted to annul this promise, which was made without his consent, he could do so according to the laws, which grant this power to parents if children under the age of twenty bind themselves by their own authority and will. But when he saw the girl's constancy, he did not want to break the promise, but allowed him to celebrate the marriage with her, but without any dowry, because he had dared to do this without asking him and she had introduced such a bad example of disobedience into her family. He therefore took her with him to his master's house, where he resides, soon to celebrate the marriage with her.</p>
      <p>However, he first goes to Zurich to inform his mother and friends about how his affairs stand. I write this to you because you also worked on this case through Mr. de Cham, so that you can inform both him and Mr. Thaddaeus Duno about how the matter stands.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All of ours greet you; greet yours also in my name.</p>
      <p>In Bern.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>I wrote the previous letter three days ago, when Muralto had given me certain hope that he would soon leave. Meanwhile, he still lingers with his fiancée, from whom he is reluctantly torn away. Since this boy is going, I wanted to give him these letters. However, I only want to add this to the previous ones: 1. As for those French rumors, they are gradually fading away, and in the meantime, it has also been written from Geneva by some of our people. There is certainly a mighty tension on both sides and secret preparations; yet one is of good hope that the matter will remain calm; may God grant this, whom we especially pray for. Some again affirm that the Spaniard has landed in Flanders. I almost do not know what to believe. Our people are praised in the camp. Some doubt whether they are feigning this reason or whether something else is underlying, but we will soon know the truth of the matter. 2. Today Brunner returns from Heidelberg with wife and children.</p>
      <p>I do not know what we will do with him, nor do I know if he will be accepted by my lords or not; it will hardly go well if he is to be so quarrelsome. 3. Also, Zorn's son is coming; he tells me about the preacher from Steckborn. Dear, let me know how he is doing. I wanted to add these to the previous ones.</p>
      <p>I ask you to take it kindly if I sometimes write uncertain things; consider that I also do not have certain news.</p>
      <p>In Bern, September 23, 1567.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, my honorable lord and most esteemed and dear compatriot.</p>
