    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer never got around to writing to [Bullinger], and also assumed that he had already heard the respective news, such as the bloodless victory [of the Schmalkaldic League] over [Duke Heinrich of] Brunswick. - Blarer thanks Bullinger for his opinion on the alliances [above No. 2269] and sends an opinion on alliances with the Papal side for review. - He is pleased that the [Confederates] demonstrated unity at the meeting in Baden. The Milanese Marquis [Alfonso d'Avalos] is not to be trusted. - Greetings. - [P.S.:] Blarer wanted to send the letter through the [Konstanz] messenger appointed to go to Zurich, but he had already departed.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Although I intended to write to you once and again, something always came up that delayed me from proceeding; then I realized it was too late to finish what I had started, as I did not doubt that you had already learned from elsewhere what I wanted to write (such as the bloodless victory of our people against the Duke of Brunswick, which you have now also heard about). Therefore, do not suspect any lack of diligence on my part, especially in writing about matters that seem to concern you and all your people. I will certainly ensure that you do not miss anything from me here, as long as I do not miss anything from the messengers.</p>
      <p>I received your advice on the matter of alliances and I thank you. In return, I am sending something else, which deals solely with forming alliances with the Papal side, about which I earnestly ask you to write your opinion to me in a few words. You will send it back with the next convenient messenger.</p>
      <p>I am exceedingly glad that there is agreement among your people, and I will be even more pleased when you have more firmly united in one spirit with unanimous consent in the true religion. I hope that the Marquis of Milan does not harbor some monster against you! Everything is now full of plots and almost inhuman endeavors. Let us fortify ourselves strongly against the world with the Lord of the world. In His hand, we will be safest. But I cannot write more.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my venerable and dearest brother of all, and continually intercede with our common Savior Christ for me with pious prayers. All of ours greet you. Greet your household with all the brothers and friends. November 3rd.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>I had completed part of the letter, which I thought I could send to you through the messenger who was recently dispatched from our people to you. But soon I heard that he had already hurriedly departed, etc.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
