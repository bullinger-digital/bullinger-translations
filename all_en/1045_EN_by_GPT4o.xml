      <p>Greetings. After I recently sent my letter to you, I soon received yours along with that document, which brought us much news from several kingdoms, for which I am very grateful to you. Regarding the continuation of the council and some other matters that you should know, as soon as I learn anything certain, do not doubt that I will ensure you are informed as soon as possible. I ask that you return Johann Ulm's letters with this message.</p>
      <p>He wrote a letter to my sister dated the first of September, in which he mentions a certain simple and obscure, yet very pious man, who in London heals any diseases with the word of Christ alone, so much so that he even restores sight to the blind, etc. If this is true, as he seriously demands to be believed here, those who do not believe the gospel will have even less to hold onto, as they cannot use their infidelity as an excuse, since we know from the beginning that signs were given not to the faithful, but to the unfaithful. Ulm adds that this man agrees beautifully with us in all things concerning the sound doctrine of faith; whether he has also written this to you, I do not know, nor have I received anything further about this from anyone, so it seemed worth mentioning here in passing. Please send us, I beg you, an example of that most cruel mandate, by which (as often before) a specimen of the unbearable persecution of our miserable Upper Germany is published, which will certainly come to pass by its own merit, if things turn out as some wish; to prevent this, let us, prostrate at the feet of our most gracious Savior, strive with faithful prayers to obtain the spirit of solid repentance, so that with a timely conversion to the one who strikes us, we may happily avert the impending wrath, although (oh deplorable misery) nowhere, wherever you turn, does anything of this shine forth in almost the entire world, as some seem to have conspired against the Lord and His Christ with false worship, others with a wicked life, and others with both, all striving here and indeed vigorously, to break their bonds and cast off the yoke. What then can you hope for, what indeed should you not fear? May the best shepherd Christ count us among His sheep and that little flock, to whom it has pleased the Father to give the kingdom. Amen.</p>
      <p>Commend us diligently in your holy prayers to heaven. Give greetings to your household, with whom, for my own, which lovingly greets them in Christ, I continually intercede with the heavenly Father. Greetings to those who love us, in the Lord. Farewell. October 9, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blaurer.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
