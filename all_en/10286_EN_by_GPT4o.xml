    <p xml:id="regest1">Dedicates his commentary to the city of Frankfurt, which contributes to the spread of the true faith throughout Europe through the distribution of books. Praises Frankfurt's tolerant attitude, where no books have been banned so far. The recent implementation of the Reformation here is another reason for the dedication. The Acts of the Apostles shows against which enemies and dangers the true faith must be defended. There was little preliminary work on the subject. Bullinger particularly benefited from Vadian's lectures on the Acts of the Apostles, but also read everything else available to him. His book is intended to encourage more reading of the Holy Scriptures rather than distract from it with commentaries. With Christ's help, may the people of Frankfurt hold fast to the true faith.</p>

      <p>To the most illustrious senate and people of Frankfurt am Main, Heinrich Bullinger sends grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>The prophets and ancient fathers had this custom, that they would dedicate their books not only to those with whom they conversed, but also to those who were unknown by face and lived far away in other lands. Following their example, I have also wished to dedicate these books of commentaries to you, most illustrious men and venerable brothers in Christ. Not because I think your church needs our instruction or commentary on true piety. For you have renowned ministers of the word, praised in the doctrine of the gospel, but as I looked around for those to whom this subject would be most fitting, you first came to mind, to whom this seemed appropriate for many reasons. For this book explains how the light of the gospel has shone upon all nations, lands, and peoples. And your city, a truly noble emporium of Germany, has been such that from it the best authors of all kinds, especially the ancient ones, have spread almost throughout all of Europe, by whose works true religion and good letters have begun to flourish. Just as other cities are famous for their authors and the skill and diligence of printing or, if one prefers, writing with types, so yours is by far the most renowned in propagating them and carrying them to the remotest corners of Europe. You have not wished, like some imprudent ones, to obscure the glory and freedom of your city by suppressing or proscribing the best books and authors. Therefore, you have approved your remarkable piety and prudence to all other cities. For even the divine Jerome was indignant at those who, in his time, rejected the best and most pious authors for some errors out of foolish fastidiousness. His words to Tranquillinus are these: "I think Origen and some ecclesiastical writers, both Greek and Latin, should be read in such a way that we choose their good parts and avoid the contrary, according to the apostle saying: 'Test everything; hold fast to what is good' [1 Thess 5:21]. However, those who are led by the perversity of their stomachs either to excessive love or hatred of him seem to me to fall under the prophetic curse: 'Woe to those who call evil good and good evil, who put bitter for sweet and sweet for bitter' [Isa 5:20]. For we should not accept wrong doctrines because of his teaching, nor should we utterly reject any useful commentaries he has written on the holy scriptures because of the wrongness of his doctrines." Indeed, Eusebius in his ecclesiastical history is the author that the illustrious Dionysius of Alexandria held this opinion. Furthermore, since Luke describes in this work the growth, increase, and proper form of the new church, it could not be more fittingly dedicated to any other than the church of Frankfurt, which has also begun to openly give its name to the truth by embracing evangelical sincerity and aspiring to the rites of the ancient church. This book will demonstrate that the most ancient truth is what some rash and unhealthy people today call a ten-year-old faith and a new heresy. It will also show with what danger and against what enemies one must fight in the arena of the true church not only to recover but also to retain ancestral truth, with what arms to conquer, what to suffer for the name of Christ, and how to counter the arts of the impious. For Luke is marvelous in this matter. They say the prince of poets, Homer, wished to describe in his outstanding work the duties of a good man and the face of a happy republic. But I would much more truly say that in this history of Luke, the duties of a Christian man and the most perfect state of the church are most perfectly expressed. The nobility and usefulness of the subject moved me to adorn this most elegant and delightful book with commentaries. The prayers of the brothers also contributed, who continually complained that nothing or certainly very little existed on this noble author, most suitable for our times. I complained that I lacked many things that seemed necessary for handling such a great matter. Therefore, I intended to wait until others more skilled in these matters, of whom our age has many, would come forward and more successfully explain this work, but while no one came forward in the meantime, they urged me to at least put my talent entrusted to me by the Lord to use; others nevertheless remain free to write or remain silent. And so far, they have prevailed. Added to this was the fact that the incomparable Doctor Joachim Vadianus, the honor of our common homeland of Switzerland, promised to complete those things that were geographical, which he also provided in the published Epitome, although he began at this fair, he could not complete it due to the vast burden of business. Furthermore, some dictations were supplied by certain brothers, which that man dictated to some Christian listeners in St. Gallen a few years ago, by which I hoped I could be greatly helped. Nor was the opinion mistaken. For they were such that if he had revised them, as they say, and published them himself, there would have been no need for my labor. Indeed, I had hoped for several years that he would do this very thing. For a few years ago, he promised this to my patron and the patron of all students, Mr. Wolfgang Joner, formerly abbot of the Chapel of the Zurichers. But business, by which he is held captive, prevented him from fulfilling it. And premature death snatched him away before he could complete it. For recently, fighting bravely in the unfortunate battle at the Chapels, he fell. Therefore, if many things are now lacking in this work, I will be worthy of pardon for this reason alone, that in a difficult and serious subject I had little support except for those dictations I have just recounted. For nothing exists in this work, as far as I know, after the most diligent and learned labors of Erasmus of Rotterdam, the glory of Germany, I mean annotations and paraphrases. For very few things are available from the ancients. For Chrysostom, according to his custom, devoted to declamations, either lightly touches on Luke's words or passes over them in recitation. But the annotations, or if one prefers to call them scholia, of Bede the Anglo-Saxon, a most learned man, are too brief to satisfy the simpler ones. As for what is recently published under the title of Justus Jonas, they are such that he seems to have sketched out a future work with a few lines, as they say, with a rough Minerva. Nor have I seen if anything else exists. What moved the ancients not to write anything on this excellent and useful book of Luke is not sufficiently clear. Perhaps they shuddered at the difficulty of the matter. If that is true, I am indeed foolish to dare what such great men shuddered at. However, I preferred to expose myself to open danger for the sake of the brothers rather than to hear the complaints of so many brothers every day outside of danger. But if they believed the subject to be so easy that no more extensive exposition was needed, the diligent reader will judge how true this is when he examines each point a little more carefully. At first glance, the things that are narrated clearly enough in the history seem to be explained, but if we penetrate to the mysteries themselves, we will say they have much more in the background than they promise on the surface. Indeed, however the matter stands, I have omitted nothing in this of either labor or diligence. Indeed, I am very conscious of my candor and fidelity. I have read the expositions of all those I could obtain, and I have sometimes reviewed the opinions of others, especially the ancients. Not that I think human opinions or explanations should be introduced into sacred letters. For from the sacred, as Hilary testifies, the simple and genuine sense must be derived and confirmed by the scriptures themselves, that is, by the rule of faith and charity, by similar or dissimilar places, circumstances, and reasons, but sought from scripture. The divine Jerome, whose greatest glory is in interpreting the scriptures, not only in the preface to the second book of commentaries on Micah but also to Aurelius Augustine himself, says: "I frankly confess that I read the writings of the ancients and in my commentaries, according to the custom of all, I present various explanations, so that from many each one may follow what he wishes." But the divine Augustine, responding to Jerome, says: "I truly confess to your charity that in those books of the scriptures, which are now called canonical, I have learned to bestow such honor and fear that I firmly believe no author of them has erred in writing anything. But if I find anything in those letters that seems contrary to the truth, I will not doubt that either the manuscript was faulty, or the translator did not grasp what was said, or I did not understand it. But I read others in such a way that, however much they excel in holiness and doctrine, I do not think it true because they thought so, but because they could persuade me either through those canonical authors or by probable reason, which does not deviate from the truth. Nor do I think, my brother, that you feel otherwise. I do not at all think you want your books to be read as those of the prophets and apostles, about whose writings it is impious to doubt that they are free from all error." Thus Augustine. Therefore, we have presented the expositions of others especially when we believed they had hit the mark, and we have presented them in this way so that those who hold as oracles what Lira, Hugo, Scotus, and that Thomas Aquinas have produced, could not continually slander the explanations we write as having been recently born in our home. Otherwise, what the ancients once protested and we have always testified in all our other works, we also now insist, that these are published with the intention of helping. For I allow pious readers to weigh what is pious, what is necessary, what is useful, what is genuine, what is foreign, what is superfluous or affected. For I do not want my writings to be believed as canonical. I do not want to prejudice the holy and learned men of this age. But if something better is revealed to another, I will not envy. For I write under this condition, that it is free for me to extend what is short, to illustrate what is obscurely said, to explain what is involved, and to establish each thing more correctly if necessary. For why should it not be allowed to me, now in my thirtieth year, what was allowed to Augustine, writing retractions as a veteran bishop at more than sixty years old? Indeed, I know there is no end to making books, as the prophet says, and as the poet says: "We write poems everywhere, learned and unlearned alike."</p>
      <p>But I believed these of ours on that book, on which few things existed, would not be unknown, by which I wished to incite more to read the scriptures than to distract from them with human commentary. However, since all growth is from God alone, we pray to Him that He may propagate the glory of His word, which for fifteen hundred years - for so many years are counted in this 33rd year above the thousand five hundredth, since "the law went out from Zion and the word of the Lord from Jerusalem" [Isa 2:3] - He has advanced as far as possible, as Luke indicates in this book, and protected with victorious power, to the end, as far as possible, may He propagate it, confirm it in the hearts of men, and defend it from the hand of the impious. And indeed, I beseech you, most illustrious men and venerable brothers in Christ, by the power and coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, that, neglecting the threats, arts, and promises of the world, you may continue to adhere firmly to the one God through His Son Jesus in true faith according to the holy scriptures. Paul, that herald of heavenly wisdom, says: "My preaching was not with persuasive words of human wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, that your faith should not be in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God" [1 Cor 2:4-5]. Therefore, rejecting human inventions, rely on the foundation of Christ, whom no one can teach more purely than the holy scripture. The Holy Spirit indeed teaches that many things must be suffered in the name of Christ. "But he who endures to the end," says the Lord, "will be saved" [Matt 24:13]. Others trust in treaties, arms, and resources in dangers, which are not evil in themselves. But you trust in God, to whom whoever truly believes will not perish forever. May the Lord Almighty, merciful and compassionate, through Christ the Lord, always increase faith in you and confirm what He has begun.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 25th of August in the year of Christ 1533.</p>
