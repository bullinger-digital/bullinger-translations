    <p xml:id="regest1">Bucer has sent the Cologne "Reformation" ["Simple Consideration"], which Blarer will soon forward to Bullinger; he has skimmed through some chapters and believes that this order is commendable, considering that it is being introduced by the Archbishop of Cologne [Hermann von Wied], although it is naturally still lacking compared to the [Reformed] churches. Nevertheless, he wishes for Christendom that the Emperor [Charles V], the Frenchman [King Francis I], and the other princes would adopt this Reformation. We must pray for Bucer, who sacrifices himself for his duties, and in view of the failure of the princes, do everything to save others. Greetings. [Enclosure:] [Ferrante I. Gonzaga] was sent by Emperor [Charles V] to King [Henry VIII] and also met with Queen Mary [of Hungary] [Governor of the Netherlands]; Henry VIII allegedly wants to support Charles V militarily against the Frenchman [Francis I]. [Francis I] is sending a delegation along with that of the Pope [Paul III] to the Diet [at Speyer]; however, it is uncertain whether they have safe conduct and whether the Emperor will listen to them; the Emperor, Landgrave [Philip of Hesse], and Elector [John Frederick of] Saxony have already arrived. [Francis I] has taken large parts of Piedmont and is besieging Ivrea [Province of Turin]. [Charles V] is trying through Duke Maurice of Saxony for the restitution of Duke Henry of Brunswick[-Wolfenbüttel], but the Protestants will not agree to this, as the Duke will certainly not grant his people religious freedom. Bullinger always emphasizes mutual loyalty and honesty, yet Zurich's support of the former guild master Thomas Hütlin baffles the people of Constance. Recently, a condescending letter from the Confederates, led by Zurich, arrived in Constance, ignoring the city's judicial claim over its citizens and demanding a hearing of Hütlin before the Thurgau governor [Melchior Heinrich] without further possibility of appeal. The role of Zurich greatly concerns the people of Constance, and Bullinger should persuade them to change course, which Blarer would also do in return. The cunning [Hütlin] has certainly deceived many people; Zurich should not sully itself with him.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Our Bucer has sent us the Cologne Reformation in recent days, which we will either send to you immediately after reading or, if we do not have time to read it, we will send it to you to read, but in such a way that you send it back to us afterwards; for many reasons, we wish to examine everything with great diligence. I have hastily skimmed through some chapters and find it such that, if you consider it prescribed by the Archbishop of Cologne, you cannot help but praise the Lord with all your heart, who has illuminated these very thick shadows with the light of His word in this way; however, if you wish to judge it by the institutions of our churches, you will certainly find much to be desired. I, for my part, do not wish our churches to be brought back to this point in many respects, but I strongly desire that the Roman Emperor, the Frenchman, and the other most powerful monarchs of the world accept this reformation, and oh, how happy the Christian world would be if it would allow itself and all its affairs to be aligned with this rule!</p>
      <p>We never cease to commend Bucer's ministry to the Lord, who is wholly devoted to this and becomes all things to all people, so that he may extend the kingdom of Christ as widely as possible, and that through infamy and good repute, through countless insults, reproaches, and unbearable slanders and injuries, by all of which, however much he is oppressed, he nevertheless repeatedly emerges superior, so that the adversaries are compelled, whether they like it or not, to recognize the divine power in him, which is perfected in weakness. Ah, my brother, how it pains all good people that through these warlike tumults and bloody efforts, our princes leave nothing remaining, which they might spend either time or expenses on rightly establishing religion and the pursuit of piety, so that we see nothing but a certain dreadful devastation of all honorable things impending, and there is no hope that our kings and princes will become wise, that they will allow themselves to be educated, that they will kiss the Son of God, Jesus Christ, lest they perish. Let us therefore free ourselves, the little flock, our souls, and whomever we can, from these evils, in which the world is more and more entangled, to prove our faith to the Lord, if we also continue to be authors of salvation for others. Pray for us constantly, my dearest Bullinger, that all the world's evils may be a discipline for our correction, lest we be condemned with this world.</p>
      <p>Greet your entire household from mine, furthermore the sweetest friend and best father Rodolph Gwalther with Theodor, Pellican, Megander, Erasmus, etc. Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Constance, February 8, 1544.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambr. Bl.</p>
      <p>Especially trusted, dear brother, you have written to me several times with the admonition that we should be faithful and honest to you; you also want to do the same. Now I truly believe that there is no lack on our part; however, I cannot conceal from you that I now hear all kinds of complaints and lamentations, even from those who have always been entirely inclined towards you and have wished you well. For it greatly offends my lords that you take so much interest in your former guild master Thomas Hütlin, who left the city a year ago because of his evil deeds.</p>
      <p>Recently, a letter came to my lords from the common Confederates, so sharp, pointed, defiant, and entirely imperious, on account of this wretched man, as if my lords were their own servants. In this letter, my lords of Zurich were mentioned at the top, which burdens us not a little, as is reasonable. It is unheard of to support someone in what is against his honor and oath, as then every citizen with us is given this in his oath, and he swears annually that he will give and take justice before a superior authority of this city in all matters that arise during his citizenship in Constance. But the common Confederates do not want to hold Hütlin, but write to my lords that it is their opinion that my lords should appoint two arbitrators and Hütlin also two, and the governor in Thurgau should be the umpire, and whatever is spoken there, it should remain without further appeal, etc. This is an intolerable matter for my lords and troubles them not a little that those of Zurich also allow themselves to be involved in such a letter, as it is truly pitiable and lamentable. I write to you about this in great brotherly trust, whether you might have a reason to dissuade your people from such a course; for I would certainly also do the same if ours were to help write or act against yours in this manner. Do not let yourselves be deceived that perhaps some of yours might have been blinded by this wretched little man; for he can perform blue wonders; whoever did not know him would have to think there was nothing but honesty in him; but he was truly a real Catiline in our council, as far as he was concerned, and to speak humanly, if he had stayed, great lamentation would have arisen. Praise be to God in eternity, who has wonderfully led him out. Although he now intends to plague us more before the city, I hope God will soon be with him, if only you do not also sully yourselves with this wretched little man; I wish you that from God, so that we may always remain good neighbors.</p>
