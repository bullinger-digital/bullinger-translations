      <p>This is common and naturally ingrained and innate in all those who pursue others with benevolence and sincere love, that they eagerly listen to them speaking, desire to converse, and derive the greatest pleasures from mutual embraces and familiar gatherings. Therefore, since I love you (most excellent man and father to be honored with the highest respect) from the heart and hold everything concerning you in high regard, I cannot omit to testify by letters the love with which I am affected towards you, even though due to the mediocrity of the present state, it is not yet permitted by other means. For although you have attained the highest degree of honor by your exceptional learning and admirable virtues, and no account of your excellence can be assigned to my ignobility, and anyone not foolish would judge that by these letters written to your excellence I am overstepping the bounds of modesty, yet your singular humanity, integrity, and constancy of words and deeds have made it so that, neglecting and closing off all those things which could deter or delay me from writing, I announce those things which I believed you were eager to know, so that with our united prayers and supplications with the chief ministers of the churches and schools of these regions, we may ardently invoke God the best and greatest, the Father of lights, and weary Him with constant prayers, that He may illuminate and enlighten not only the minds of the lords of this region but also of all the surrounding ones with His holy spirit, so that at last they may understand His oracles purely and holy without any affection of previously conceived evil zeal and may explain and profess them constantly, so that this matter, which is now agitated with the greatest fervor and under the pretext of the greatest piety, may obtain a good and salutary outcome for many.</p>
      <p>Therefore, so that you may more clearly and plainly perceive the whole matter, I will begin a little higher and briefly touch upon what gave occasion to this synod, which is now being held.</p>
      <p>After the third apology of Mr. Beza, when no one responded to the absurdities of Selnecker, it happened that that Exegesis on the Supper (which you have undoubtedly already read)</p>
      <p>first appeared for sale in Leipzig and Wittenberg in the month of March. As soon as this became known to one of the court preachers, indeed to him who is most hostile to us, named Georg Lystenius, he burst out in a sermon, in which the prince was also present, into these words, saying: "Again, a certain absurd infant has fallen from the devil's stockings; the godfathers are indeed known to many, but the father himself is hidden, who, however, could easily be found with diligent inquiry."</p>
      <p>Therefore, after the sermon was finished, the prince demanded that he declare what he meant by that figurative and veiled speech, which was also done; for he understood that this writing had been published with the help of the Wittenbergers and Leipzigers, and there was a constant rumor that it had been printed by the Voegelian press. Therefore, with the matter understood, the prince, moved by anger, calls to himself the excellent man Mr. Peucer, whom he examines about each detail, and after hearing his response, he is sent home, and in the meantime, while these things are being done, no Exegesis appeared, and many other books on this subject were taken from the booksellers and brought to the prince's court, and it was seriously forbidden for them to either buy or sell our writings on this controversy. After these things were thus transacted, Jakob Andreae came to Dresden and there, in the manner of Selnecker, sought the favor of the princess not without the detriment of others' praise and safety. And what was aiding the cause of these present evils, it happened around that time that Mr. Johannes Hermann, a Swabian by nation, the prince's physician, was excluded from the court and the entire dominion of the elector due to some inept and, as they report, arrogant response given to the princess about a certain matter, although the common people assert that this whole affair happened because he was convicted of Calvinism (as they call it). Friends of this man complain to each other in letters about his case and educate each other about many other things, both those which are done by the nod and will of the elector and those which are done by the instigation of his wife. In the same way, Johannes Stössel, doctor of theology and superintendent of Pirna, which is a town not more than two miles distant from Dresden, sends a letter through a certain woman to his relative Mr. Christian Schütz, one of the court preachers, in which, besides other things contained in it, the republic of the elector was called γθναικοκρατεια (gynaecocracy), because a woman held the highest power. However, this letter was not delivered to the one to whom it was owed, which was the beginning of this present evil.</p>
      <p>For that rustic woman, who was supposed to deliver the letters to Mr. Christian, made a mistake. For when she had arrived in that street in Dresden where the court preachers live, she happened by chance upon that other preacher, namely Lystenius, whom she asked whether those letters belonged to him (the inscription was in German and indeed directed to Mr. Christian's wife to avoid suspicion, but inside everything was written in Latin).</p>
      <p>He replied: "I will see," and when he had received the letter, perhaps less accurately folded, he saw through a certain crack that everything inside was written in Latin words and for that reason did not want to give it to the one to whom it belonged; however, imposing on the rustic woman, he said that these letters were owed to him. Therefore, the woman, having been dismissed, delivered the letters to the prince, saying that there could not be anything but evil in these letters, since the inscription is in German, but inside, as far as she could see, everything is narrated in Latin.</p>
      <p>Therefore, with the letters opened and those things which I mentioned above about γθναικοκρατεια (gynaecocracy) found, the prince elector summons Mr. Christian, to whom the letter truly belonged, and holds him captive until he had examined and read through all his letters, which he had found in his house. In a similar manner, he immediately calls Mr. Stössel, who had written the letters, to Dresden, and after he had also seen all his letters, as was done with the former, through his messengers, he acquired them. Therefore, after reading the letters of both, Peucer is also summoned by the elector, who, as soon as he arrived in Dresden, is bound, and with him the chief counselor Georg Cracovius, doctor of both laws. After a few days, therefore, they are all dismissed on the condition that each one awaits at home the penalty which the prince will impose. Therefore, so that the elector may not seem to have done anything by private counsel, he convenes a synod at Torgau, where he orders all those who are addicted to this sect to be examined by his theologians, whom he judged to be free from Calvinism, so that at the same time and once for all, the same sentence may be passed on all those who have deserved the same. Therefore, 16 superintendents of his dominion are summoned, all of whom convened on the 25th of May; from the Wittenbergers, however, only Mr. Major, a man worn out by age and disease, is carried there in a litter, but after a few days he returned. In the following week, after the feast of Pentecost, the remaining theologians are summoned in this manner, so that first of all, namely on the 2nd of June, Pastor Mr. Friedrich Widebram comes to the synod and gives an account of his doctrine, and on the following day Mr. Caspar Cruciger, on the third, that is, on the 4th of June, Mr. Heinrich Moller does the same, and the next day Mr. Christoph Pezel follows him, and lastly, that is, on the 6th of June, Mr. Erasmus Rudinger, professor of arts, appears in the same manner before this council. Therefore, they all departed, and nothing certain is known about what is being done with them, but it is certain that they are all held captive separately in the houses of citizens. It is also rumored that the prince is convening a general assembly of all his nobles and councilors, so that with unanimous consent this whole matter may be judged and brought to an end. When the matter has been brought to an end, I will also inform you of the rest.</p>
      <p>Farewell. May God keep you and all yours in His care. Given at Wittenberg on the 8th of the Ides of June 1574.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your dignity, Johann Jakob Murer.</p>
