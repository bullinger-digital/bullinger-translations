      <p>Greetings. I received your kind letter along with the detailed account of French affairs through the excellent and most learned man, Mr. François Portus, and I give your kindness my greatest thanks.</p>
      <p>I pray to the Lord that He may guide this matter of great expectation. I certainly do not disagree with you, who believe that those who now promise themselves security and claim that truth has triumphed in France are gravely mistaken. I acknowledge that the truth of Christ never fails to triumph, but the history of all times testifies to how much trouble and difficulty it takes to displace falsehood from its place.</p>
      <p>Nor is it unclear how powerful the cardinals and bishops are, and how the world and the princes of this age favor them and wish them to be safe. What comforts me above all in these cares and anxieties is that I see God is planning something great in France. Otherwise, He would not have removed two kings in such an admirable manner within a short time.</p>
      <p>Let us therefore pray to God diligently that He may complete what He has begun. We will add our diligence and effort, expecting His abundant blessing.</p>
      <p>I understand from Germany that some of the princes, especially the Duke of Württemberg, who is entirely devoted to the Augsburg Confession, are wholly intent on imposing their Augsburg Confession on the princes of France. Indeed, there are some among the Lutherans who boast among their own that they will soon drive out Calvinism through the Augsburg Confession and have it banned from France. Now they are working in an extraordinary manner throughout Germany to have everyone subscribe anew to the Augsburg Confession and the new preface recently established at Naumburg.</p>
      <p>They hope that by their numbers and concord they will achieve much with the leaders of France. If you have not yet seen that preface, I am sending it to you, but please return it, etc.</p>
      <p>It is certain that many subscribe unwillingly and do not approve of everything in it: nevertheless, since the majority of the princes approve of it and the emperor does not grant peace except to those who subscribe to the Augsburg Confession, they subscribe as well. This is the integrity of the faithful, indeed.</p>
      <p>It is necessary for you to be vigilant here diligently. Vergerius boasts as if the matter were settled, and foolishly believes that it has been accomplished by his diligence and industry. But I refrain from burdening you with more business, as you are very busy.</p>
      <p>Would that a pious and learned man be found in France, who, with a modest writing that does not touch the German princes too offensively, would explain to the leaders of France the reasons why it is fitting to abstain from foreign confessions and retain their own. It is most certain that regarding the Mass, the Lord's Supper, confession, and absolution, the Augsburg Confession is not complete. And now all the Lutherans are trying to explain it in the matter of the Lord's Supper through the Apology, insisting on the grossest sense, contending that the impious orally consume the real and essential substantial flesh of Christ. They therefore agree with the papists and, with their Luther, accept the canon from De Consecratione, distinction 2, "Ego Berengarius."</p>
      <p>I now remain silent about the fact that this confession was written at an unfavorable time, and by those who then feared Charles's power and submitted servilely in many things. Nor are there now lacking princes who would prefer some corrections, if they were not hindered by the multitude of others. But you know these things better yourself: therefore, I will not add more now.</p>
      <p>May the Lord bless you and keep you safe with us for a long time. Greet Mr. Budaeus and Jonville and all the fellow ministers. All of ours greet you as well, especially my brother and relative Gwalther, and my three sons-in-law Zwingli, Lavater, and Simler. Zürich, October 5, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I believe that the Lithuanian Mr. Martin has already delivered my letters to you, from which I expect you to reply and to return Cruciger's letter. If it is not too much trouble for you, I would like to have sent to me through one of your people the booklet entitled: "The Impiety of Valentinus Gentilis Exposed," etc. Our Mr. François Ramboletius will report on all our affairs. He lived with Gwalther for a long time.</p>
      <p>I do not commend him to you, as I believe he is already loved by you.</p>
