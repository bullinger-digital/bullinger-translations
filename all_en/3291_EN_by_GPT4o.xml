      <p>Greetings. I give you considerable thanks for the sermons on the Apocalypse of Saint John that were published and for the copy of them that you gave me. In return, to show some sign of gratitude for your kindness, I am sending you my Commentaries on the Sacred History. If they are pleasing to you, it will be most gratifying to me.</p>
      <p>It may happen that in the explanation of the numbers, which the Apocalypse presents, we do not agree; but such a disagreement will not be so significant as to dissolve the friendship between us, which has been strengthened in Christ. Moreover, I am digressing into a common topic about the sacraments, and I wish to be informed in due time of what you think about its exposition. Farewell in the Lord, along with Mr. Bibliander, Mr. Peter Martyr, Mr. Gwalther, Occhino, and the other pastors and ministers of your church. Basel, 57, on the calends of September.</p>
      <p>Martin Borrhaus.</p>
      <p>To the vigilant pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a friend and brother to be respected in the Lord.</p>
