      <p>Greetings. I received your letters and read them with pain about the extreme corruption of your people. God will not always be despised without punishment, nor will He endure this wickedness much longer. Meanwhile, we know that God does not wish for the death of the sinner, but rather that he turns and lives; hence, we must labor with faithful proclamation of the divine word, if perhaps by our duty we can rescue many from this fire and lead them to the refreshment of eternal life.</p>
      <p>For this reason, the Lord wants the preaching of His gospel to be announced everywhere before His final coming, certainly to many for judgment. From the Netherlands, we have not even a word.</p>
      <p>Angusola denies and strongly denies that it is true, what is written as true from many cities of Germany, that there was a battle on November 12th and that the Spaniards suffered a defeat. From France, we also have no confirmed news. It is written that the captain of Fribourg wrote to the senate from the Fribourg camp that the French engaged in a skirmish; but the Swiss stood in line and neither gave nor received any damage. We hear elsewhere that the king with his troops is retreating to Paris, but the soldiers of Condé persistently follow the royal troops and do not allow them any rest. The Burgundians, fearing the large forces of Orange invading France, are transporting their possessions, which they can, to Neuchâtel and nearby places of the Bernese and trust them to be hidden there. The state of affairs is pitiable. Do you not think, my brother, that France is to be torn apart piece by piece by so many forces of enemies and friends? This is God's severe but just judgment. May the Lord have mercy on us all and lead us to a true knowledge of Himself.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 21, 1569.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger the elder.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church of Chur, esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
      <p>My Raphael, having been ordered to diligently review Donatus and the parts of speech, which he has almost forgotten, made some excuse about business with his mother and immediately rushed out of the house and ran through the streets as usual, whom I ask you to help correct with extended beatings.</p>
