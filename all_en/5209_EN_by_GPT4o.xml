      <p>Greetings. I can add nothing.</p>
      <p>You see what Zanchi writes and what he requests; ensure that after reading this, Rüger also reads it. Once, the Württemberg delegation presented their confession to the Council of Trent. What if now they negotiate with those cardinals, if it is accepted by them, etc.? Consider the rest. Previously, Brenz advised him to accept the Interim; what can one trust now? Let us pray to the Lord, that He may support His cause and restrain the false evangelicals, so they do not harm the good cause. Destroy this after you send other things to Rüger; keep this secret with you; because I trust the matter as it is. May the Lord keep you! March 9.</p>
      <p>I believe you have received a copy of my response given to Brenz. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, residing in Winterthur, a revered lord and his very dear brother.</p>
