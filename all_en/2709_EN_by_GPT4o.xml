      <p>Greetings. Your recent letter, most illustrious man, was very pleasing to me, as it was written by you about your elegant and most beloved son. When he asked me to write some sacred saying in his little book, which he carries with him for this purpose, to remind him of piety, I did so gladly, because he requested something useful for himself, pleasing to you as a parent, and worthy of my studies. Regarding the exiles from Lucerne, I diligently discussed with our magistrate about providing some assistance to help these pious people. He indeed promised to make an effort so that they might feel honored by some benefit from the Republic of Basel; for it is required by piety to treat exiles for the profession of the Gospel kindly, as God has particularly commended them along with widows and orphans.</p>
      <p>Would that I had the ability to do as much good for this kind of people as I have the will; they would not lack from me the necessities for their sustenance. Farewell, most illustrious man, with your wife and children and the ministers of the Gospel, whom I wish to fare well in Christ. Basel.</p>
      <p>Martin Borrhaus, yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, vigilant pastor of the Church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich</p>
