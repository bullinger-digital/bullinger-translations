      <p>Greetings. I wrote to you on the 28th of March through the son of Hieronymus Empor with letters, which I wished to be delivered by your delegates to the delegates of Basel, so that they might be conveyed to the noble lady of Schönau. I am very eager to know whether you have received them.</p>
      <p>There is absolutely nothing beyond what I indicated in those letters that I need to write to you about. You constantly intercede with the Lord on our behalf, so that He does not burden this tolerable exile of ours with new hardships. My brother has not yet returned.</p>
      <p>My wife along with her sister sends greetings to you and your household. May all friends and brothers be well. Farewell.</p>
      <p>On the first of April, 1549.</p>
      <p>I received the letters addressed to Gervasius, including those addressed to me, late.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To his dear Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
