      <p>S. A merchant, a citizen of our city, returned to me, most illustrious man, from France, who was also in Paris for some time. He reports that the number of the faithful is continually increasing, so that, where there were 100 a year ago, now 1000 can be found. But why should I write more extensively about these things, since you have long been informed about the supplications, about the free preaching of the gospel, and have more information than I can recount. Moreover, he received a book from a certain scholar there, who asked him to have it delivered to you; he returned it to me and I have no doubt that you have long since read it.</p>
      <p>I indeed wanted to quickly read through the same; but since a messenger offered himself so conveniently, I did not want to keep it with me any longer without sending it to you, and I would like to read this Vilagagnon's book; for he is indeed (in my judgment) a remarkable slanderer of Mr. Philipp and Mr. Calvin.</p>
      <p>But what do I judge of his writing, since I have only glanced at a few things in passing.</p>
      <p>Would that it were also granted (which I previously impudently requested from your kindness) to read your writing to the Synod of Chur and its confession. We are amazed at what has been done about Schleher, captured in Switzerland; the rumor is varied, and we will certainly perceive the truth, if it would be convenient for your kindness to communicate and inform us of such matters. I am forced to break off the letter due to the unexpected departure of Rudolf, who will deliver all these things to you, and we have nothing else with which we can now make you more certain. Farewell and live with all the pious and learned men, whom you will greet in our name.</p>
      <p>The letters enclosed here were received in Paris by the same merchant mentioned above, pertaining to your son-in-law; you will greet him and your other sons-in-law most dutifully in my name. Our Simpertus sends you many greetings.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, July 24, 1561.</p>
      <p>Y[our] h[umanity's] d[evoted] Jakob Rüeger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in learning and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord and brother in Christ, to be greatly respected.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich.</p>
