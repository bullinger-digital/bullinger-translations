    <p xml:id="regest1">Received the letter only on January 1st; rejoices over the new friendships and the recognition for his [play "Susanna"] and is glad that Christoph [Froschauer] was able to base the reprint on a corrected copy; owes much to his former teacher Pellikan. Even if the invitation [to the performance of his work in Zurich] had arrived in time, he could not have followed it due to his sick wife and the lack of travel permission, yet "Susanna" shall be the pledge of their friendship. Sends thanks to the students [who performed], will continue to maintain the friendly relationship [with the people of Zurich] and conveys greetings from Bonifacius [Wolfhart], [Wolfgang] Musculus, and also from [Wolfgang] Rehlinger, who has renounced the mayor's office.</p>

      <p>Greetings in Christ the Lord.</p>
      <p>Only on the very first day of the month were your most kind letters delivered to me. Whether the new year could have begun more auspiciously for me, I do not know; for I have always considered it a great part of happiness to enjoy the friendship of great and pious men. I heartily congratulate myself, to whom, far beyond my merit, the friendship of those is offered, whom every devout person everywhere now rightly venerates. I am now beginning to be somewhat pleased with myself, seeing that my trifles are not disapproved by good and learned men. However, I wish that Christoph had refrained from reprinting, unless he had come across a corrected copy, of which I had sent several to Basel both to friends and students; for I am greatly annoyed by the edition, because besides several disgraceful errors, the names of persons are sometimes not marked in their places, which you could easily detect, indeed, criticize with your sagacity, and truly your edition is more correct than ours. Master Pellicanus, my venerable former teacher, easily noticed what I owe to him in that little work; he can rightfully claim it as his own with my consent.</p>
      <p>The reason I did not come to your most kind invitation, as I said, is that the letters were delivered only on the very first day of the month. Nor, even if I had received them most timely, would it have been possible partly because of my wife's illness, who has been lying sick for the fifth month now, and partly because I could not easily obtain permission to travel from the magistrate; otherwise, neither the inconvenience of the journey nor the expense would have hindered me, for I could have had enough legitimate business in Basel incidentally. Furthermore, I embrace your friendship, indeed your goodwill; therefore, deign henceforth to let Xystus cling to some part of your friendship. Let Susanna be both a pledge and a token on both sides.</p>
      <p>And to those eager students wishing to strike a pact of grace with me, whoever they are (for they are all good, unless I am mistaken), I pledge mutual love with this letter.</p>
      <p>To each of them, in my name, wish health and offer my service. Meanwhile, I will take care that the smoking flax of recent friendship is not extinguished through silence. The reason for my delayed response is that there was no opportunity of messengers departing for Zurich. Master Bonifacius and Musculus send their regards. Rehlinger has resigned from the consulship due to health; therefore, he now, as a private citizen, has instructed me to convey his greetings and goodwill to your kindness in return.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Augsburg, January 23.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your name, Xystus Betuleius.</p>
      <p>To the theologians, Masters Heinrich Bullinger, Konrad Pellikan, Georg Binder, teaching the word of the Lord and good letters in Zurich, esteemed masters and friends.</p>
