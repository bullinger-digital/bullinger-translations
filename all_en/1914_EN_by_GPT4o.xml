      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ the Savior, etc.</p>
      <p>These days, Thomas Albertus came to me, formerly a canon irregular in Öhningen, now a disciple of Christ for several years. He told me how, during the peasant uprising, he was a parish priest in Lottstetten by the appointment of his provost, before he was fully ordained as a priest. However, when he was forced by the tyranny of the nobility to leave his parish and return again to Öhningen, the provost there wanted to compel him to complete his priesthood and celebrate mass. Since he did not want to comply with this for pious and just reasons, he was forced to withdraw from Öhningen to his own people. He also once sought through your most honorable magistrate from the provost to be treated according to his merit and to have something to live on in the future; but all in vain.</p>
      <p>However, what he is now going to do with the successor of the provostship, he will tell you in person. He asked me for this one thing, to pray to you that you might intercede with the honorable consul on his behalf; for he knows that you have great influence with him, not only because of your piety but also because of your kinship. The consul promised him his assistance, which he will undoubtedly provide all the more willingly when he sees you supporting him. Make sure that he feels my prayers have some influence with you; for in this way, you will render someone otherwise indebted to you even more indebted. We have no news, except that our soldier began to serve the great Frenchman on the 1st of July, to our great sorrow. If you have any news and have the time, I pray you inform us. Grübelius and Jacob greet you.</p>
      <p>Farewell and live long happily. Schaffhausen, July 3, 1553. Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished Heinrich Bullinger, conspicuous for his doctrine, candor, and piety, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his most honorable lord.</p>
