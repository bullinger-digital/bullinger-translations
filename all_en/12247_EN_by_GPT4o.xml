      <p>News:</p>
      <p>The decision of the Imperial Diet is pending and will be delayed until the Emperor's envoy returns from Rome. The Emperor has submitted to the Council and agreed to be obedient, which is why he cannot grant the Protestants a lasting peace; therefore, the money that was approved to be paid - but with the condition that a lasting peace is achieved - will not be given. However, there is concern that the Emperor will grant a sham peace, which will be disputable and not valid.</p>
      <p>The daughter of Ferdinand, the Queen of Poland, was healthy and then dead within three days. And the king, nevertheless, dispatched a hundred thousand guilders for the dowry in a few days; thus, both life and goods are gone together.</p>
      <p>Also, the Elector Palatine is doing very well. He has allied with Württemberg. Likewise, Bavaria and the Landgrave are on brotherly terms with each other; it will be announced shortly.</p>
      <p>Our canons have submitted a sharp supplication against our Bishop of Constance. It was read in the Imperial Council, and everyone laughed.</p>
      <p>I cannot delay the departing and waiting messenger. Farewell. I was not allowed to add anything. July 22.</p>
      <p>A truce with the Turk is confirmed.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
