    <p xml:id="regest1">[Diethelm] Röist does not want the impression to arise that they wish to remove the preacher [Matthias Bodmer], who is gladly heard by certain people, out of blind hatred, and therefore desires a detailed conversation with him in the presence of [Heinrich Brennwald]; Bullinger cannot accomplish anything alone. Two other cases that are pending can probably be resolved more easily than that of Bodmer. Had no time yet to describe the battle [at Gubel]. The Emperor has promised the Swiss cantons a general council in a letter; does not know if the people of Zurich have received a copy.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Regarding your matter, dearest brother, I have had various thoughts. It seemed to me that Röist might not be entirely pleased with the matter. Not because he desires anything from you, but because he fears for us, lest any suspicion falls back on us, as if we, blinded by envy, wish to remove him, whom several people (as you know we have many) gladly hear preaching. I replied to him with what came to mind, intending to speak more extensively with him when your father-in-law comes. I will not be able to resolve this matter successfully on my own. Therefore, ensure that your father-in-law comes at some point. If this does not succeed, we will try other means.</p>
      <p>There are two others here with whom I will speak when you come here. And with them, I believe we will settle matters much more conveniently than with Bodmer.</p>
      <p>I have not yet described the battle of Gubel, being hindered by other matters.</p>
      <p>The Emperor has sent a letter to all the Swiss cantons, promising a general council, meanwhile urging unity. Here, I cannot easily say whether this was the Emperor's doing or that of another craftsman. Furthermore, I do not know whether our people have received a copy of it.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>July 22, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Johannes Stumpf, pastor in Bubikon, dearest brother.</p>
