      <p>Greetings and best wishes. Upon returning from Franconia on February 24th, the distinguished Franz Muralt handed me your letters. I read the previous ones with great pleasure. Although I have not yet fully explained myself on all matters, I strongly approve, praise, and proclaim most of them, indeed almost all, and I know them to be true. And because the matters on which I have a slightly different opinion are not of great importance, and I have previously convinced myself, and am more convinced by reading yours, I refrain from disputing them either with you or with others.</p>
      <p>For I prefer to appear as if I have seen nothing in matters that are not so necessary, rather than to attack the opinions of others that stem from a pious and sincere heart. Therefore, on to other matters.</p>
      <p>First, I do not ask you to explain in detail what you think of our Antiparacelsian disputations. For I know how busy you are. However, I would like others to read them and inform me about those things which are either not correct, obscure, false, out of place, or too concise, so that I may have the opportunity to correct them in the future.</p>
      <p>Then I learned from Franz Muralt that he, along with his brother and father, treats not only those diseases to which other surgeons usually apply their hands, but also internal ones: among these, dropsy and the plague, and they have produced great and illustrious experiments in these. I wish to know if this is indeed the case. For many boast of things they have never accomplished, or not in the way they claim to have accomplished them.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new that I think you would want to be informed about. I will only say that Mr. Evichius recently wrote to me and made such an honorable mention of you that I think nothing in his life has been more pleasant than your friendship.</p>
      <p>He eagerly awaits your letters, and values them like a treasure. May God Almighty bless you. Amen. The price of grain has somewhat decreased.</p>
      <p>I bought a bushel of grain for one and a half florins and more, which is less than before.</p>
      <p>Franz says that he or his brother treated your son for a rupture in a vein. I ask you to inform me how much I should believe this.</p>
      <p>Your most observant, Thomas Erastus, to the most learned theologian and most faithful pastor of the RÃ¶tteln church, his distinguished relative, Johann Jakob Grynaeus.</p>
