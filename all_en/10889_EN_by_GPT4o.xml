      <p>Peace and grace from God our Father and Lord Jesus Christ be with you always, etc.</p>
      <p>Well-learned, pious, prudent, wise, kind dear lords and brothers. As I previously presented myself to you on behalf of my gracious lords of Zurich regarding several parishes, and at that time I could not succeed; now, however, I have been presented again by you in these days and my gracious lords have accepted and granted me the parish of Laufen, in which matter you were not the least involved and earnestly worked so that I would be provided for, for which effort and earnest work I express my deep thanks to you, with the offer to repay you in any way I can. I ask you hereby to pray to God for me, that He may open my mouth, so that I may proclaim His praise and glory, and also send me His spirit, so that I may fulfill everything that is God's will according to His divine will. I also entrust myself to you, that you may assist and advise me in all ways; so that I may fulfill such a difficult office according to the will of God. And if I do not conduct myself as I should, may you fatherly warn and correct me. May the Lord God dwell with us all, and give us His spirit. Amen.</p>
      <p>Dated June 20, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your willing</p>
      <p>Heinrich Stoll, citizen of Winterthur.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, pious, prudent, and wise Master Heinrich Bullinger and Master Leo Jud, his kind, dear lords and friends.</p>
