      <p>I received the bundle of letters, for which, as for many other things, I do not give thanks, but I deny that there is anyone who, even if he has perhaps received more, would admit to owing you more. But why words, where action is needed? Since my strength is not sufficient for this, I earnestly pray to the Lord that you may someday feel that you have not always shown gratitude to an ungrateful person. Moreover, so that you also know that I am not unaware that nothing can be more pleasing to you and nothing more dear to your heart than to see the glory of God promoted everywhere, be assured that in Italy the Lord has stirred many spirits, from whom you will easily understand how much fruit is to be hoped for, both from what you will soon read here and elsewhere in print, and from what you will hear has happened even more quickly in Italy itself. The beast does not doubt to attack and assail Christ with its horns in us, and we, relying on divine help, will be uncertain about the conquest, as if the triumphs of victory, which await us most firmly, elude us. In vain indeed, relying on their own strength, which is none, the proud and hypocrites, boasting of Christ only in words and with the pen, promise themselves anything from him. But we, desperate of all, trusting only in Christ from the heart and adorned with the same, shall we ever hope for so much, without him being about to grant much greater things, or have we not long observed that the Lord does not want this praise to be snatched from him, that he always exceeds our known spirits with all his own? Therefore, the higher he raises us in hope, the more splendid deeds he signifies he will perform. There is no reason for us to waver, which we will not do, being strengthened by the same spirit. Furthermore, they write that that hunchbacked Roman scoundrel dares to assert that he will soon send Caesar to Orcus. "For we are not" he says "so old that we cannot still sing one more requiem." If he prophesies this as truly about his spiritual firstborn as he once did about his carnal son, I ask whether it will seem strange or unusual to you.</p>
      <p>Myconius briefly disapproves of your agreement with Calvin and curses some of the latter chapters, "in which" he says "I easily recognize the old song of the Zurichers, who, oh how much more wisely, if they had persisted in the confession, in which, while Leo was still alive, they conspired with me" he says "for by that alone all controversies would have long since been removed; for even Luther himself was so pleased with it in all respects, that he said as if foreseeing: If they write this from the heart, it agrees well between us; but I fear there is deceit." To this I cannot so easily be led to believe that the Zurichers acted so deceitfully and lightly in a matter so simple and serious. I wanted to indicate this to you separately, so that you would know how men are devoted to men, with a disease more pernicious than the world thinks, lest I should ever suffer, I greatly desire to know whether my letters were ever delivered to Calvin, since these days one of those two, to whom I had given letters attached to the Calvinists, writes to me that he has not read mine for two months. If fate allows that they have been lost, I will not hesitate to repeat once justly demanded for the glory of God and perhaps going to Geneva as well, when my presence is desired. That [...] I say, may the heavenly Father be fixed in my heart forever, that your glory [...] is to be illustrated in the elect with all others perishing, and that this may be done above all my desire soon, pray for me ardently, dearest to God and most esteemed by me, Bullinger, and let this be ours.</p>
      <p>Basel, July 8, 1549.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently.</p>
      <p>Most eager to serve you, Lelio Sozzini. I wish Mr. Gualter and Mr. Zwingli well.</p>
      <p>The doctrine is to the most illustrious man in piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop among the Zurichers, always most esteemed. In Zurich.</p>
      <p>I highly commend the enclosed, send them as soon as possible to the ministers of Chur.</p>
