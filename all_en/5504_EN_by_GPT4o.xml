      <p>S. P. in the Lord through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>What the Livian history records about Mettius Suffetius being torn apart by horses among the Romans, the same, most esteemed man, can be said about the state of the churches in Lesser Poland at present. Everything has been so torn apart, mixed up, profaned, and defiled by these new apostles that you can neither recognize the feet, nor the hands, nor the head in this mystical body of Christ the Lord. Part has gone over to Stancarus, part to Blandrata and [Lismaninus, and] part, by the grace of God, adheres to the former confession. The matter is in itself atrocious and horrible to see: but it affects and moves any pious and sincere person even more, the more those who deceive the most act as if they are good and honest citizens [of the community, that is] of both our churches and yours, while meanwhile they meditate day and night on nothing but to shake the Catholic consensus in the article of the worship of the Trinity from its very foundations. All this your piety can recognize more clearly from the letters of our Trecius, which I also allow you to open and diligently examine, indeed I ask again and again and afterwards communicate to Master John Calvin. We beseech you, our most esteemed lords and brothers, to help us with both pious prayers, which we know for certain are not a vain murmur before God, and with advice. And indeed all those who have given their names to Christ are obliged to help each other with mutual works: but you, excellent Mr. Bullinger, are compelled by a special right, (so to speak) to be at hand for us.</p>
      <p>For if Lismaninus had not been recommended by you, this faction of most monstrous men would never have acquired favor for themselves in our churches.</p>
      <p>He flew here to be like a leader and standard-bearer for this impiety. By his own authority, Blandrata came here, followed by Spinella, Alciatus, Gentilis, for they all flocked here to Pińczów. They commend them and promote their business.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, they cunningly write to you, tempering their style and transforming themselves like Proteus, so that you might at least in some way approve their doctrines. But I beseech you not to let them impose on you under the title of these churches, for they are a thousand artifices.</p>
      <p>Although we do not doubt that you abound so much in the gift of the discernment of spirits, that from a single word of theirs, like the claw of a lion, you easily recognize the lion itself. It is easy to understand their cunning since they could not obtain the patronage of their error with you by conversing (as they assert because their persons were already hated), now they attempt to obtain the same again through certain locals who were dearer to you, under the title of these churches here.</p>
      <p>For they think you Germans to be so light and incautious, that by merely changing persons, you would also change your judgment about this cause. As if indeed it was mere hatred and not the iniquity of the cause that moved you to condemn this error of theirs. O detestable frauds of men.</p>
      <p>You would see, my lords, if they obtained even the slightest dissimulation, not to say assent, from you with these diabolical arts of theirs, how they would offer you to the whole world and accuse you of levity. Indeed, to us, who have decided by God's grace to cultivate a constant fraternal society with you, it cannot be said how terrible they would try to appear. But why do we weary your ears by bringing these things to you? You, who by God's grace know this kind of animal better, and have so often warned us to recognize them and beware of them: for which benefit we all thank you. May the ineffable goodness of God crown you in this and in the future life.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed brothers and lords. For God's sake, return our Trecius to us and as quickly as possible send him to us along with a response.</p>
      <p>He does wrong by not deigning to help our churches placed in these straits, perhaps avoiding the cross. Indeed, he ought to be chastised by the word of God.</p>
      <p>But let him forgive me.</p>
      <p>The rest your lordship will understand from the letters of Trecius.</p>
      <p>What I write, however, is for the most illustrious man, outstanding in doctrine and piety, Master Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of Zurich, reverently esteemed lord and brother.</p>
