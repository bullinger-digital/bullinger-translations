      <p>Greetings. Brother, the one you sent to us from Davos returns to you having achieved both our wishes and his own. But he will explain everything to you himself.</p>
      <p>I often wonder to myself what will eventually become of our situation here, as evangelical preachers are treated with such contempt, even though there are so few of them. Nevertheless, I thank you very much, most kind man, for the book of your second sermons on Jeremiah, but believe me, I am even more grateful for the little note written by your hand at the front of the book. I consider it a great honor (no matter what those sons of rigid Stoics may grumble) that you remembered me in such a way as to place the name of your Philippus there. There is no news here, except that it is now certain that the Turk is occupying the Tyrrhenian Sea and is formidable to the Genoese. Farewell, most kind of men, and do not cease to love your Philippus in return.</p>
      <p>From Chur, July 19, 1558.</p>
      <p>Entirely yours in integrity, Philippus Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Heinrich Bullinger, always to be honored by all good people.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
