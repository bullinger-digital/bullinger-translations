      <p>Through Christ Jesus. Greetings. I have seen, my most delightful and esteemed Bullinger, how with skill and piety you have softened and clarified those things in your writing which seemed to me harsher.</p>
      <p>You show quite openly that you do not wish to uphold those things except in the sense that is most consistent with the divine writings and testimonies. In this opinion, you could have clearly recognized from my recent letters that I also share. However, if those words and expressions are brought into contention, I would prefer to lose them rather than obscure the true and genuine meaning of the divine authorities. On the contrary, I would not hesitate to retain and value them in some place, if by rejecting and losing them, it would be necessary to undermine some part of religion. For the essence of things must be held in the first place, then words should be used to illuminate, not obscure, the matter. Indeed, my excellent and learned brother, I do not write this to teach or admonish you, who can present these things to me far better than I to you; but I write these things so that you understand that I have the least concern for words, and the greatest for matters. Therefore, to speak briefly, I consider it hardly permissible, indeed not permissible at all, to dissent from what you yourself approve. You will have me as a companion in your opinion, as you wish.</p>
      <p>However, the reason I wrote more freely about what I think is due to my natural candor and your well-known benevolence towards me.</p>
      <p>Farewell and dutifully greet your most honorable family on our behalf and always love me, as you do.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 26, 1549.</p>
      <p>Caelius S[ecundus] C[urio] signed, yours sincerely.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the church of Zürich, singular patron.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
