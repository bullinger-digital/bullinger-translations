      <p> Greetings. On the 4th day before the calends of November, I came to Winterthur with my wife and dearest children, despite the great inclemency of the weather, which is commonly thought to be a good and fortunate sign for those moving from one place to another and wishing to establish a home, if they experience unfavorable weather during the journey. But you, my venerable and dearest brother, pray diligently with me to our heavenly Father, who alone is our fortune and indeed our solid good, with full devotion, that just as He has so far made this exile of mine and my family's not only tolerable but also advantageous in many ways through His favor, He may also continue to make whatever troubles we must endure sweet with the seasoning of His spirit. Indeed, the best Father has so far nurtured me far more kindly than I deserved, so that there is nothing at all about which I can justly complain, but much more for which I should give Him the greatest thanks; may His name be blessed forever, amen. I wanted to write to you a little, despite being very busy; for you know how active those are who move into another house in unpacking and arranging their belongings; therefore, I ask you to forgive both the brevity and the insipid writing. </p>
      <p> I ask you greatly to assist our Butler here with your present help; he left his wife here, lest, if he had already brought her there with him, it might seem as if he had deliberately wanted to throw her into certain danger. For it cannot be expressed how cruelly the plague rages there, which some boast more vainly, as I hope and wish, than truthfully, so that he thought he should take into account the condition of his pregnant wife, not with bad advice (as it seems to me). He will do, however, what you yourself will order. </p>
      <p> May the Lord keep you and your household safe and make you secure from the striking angel! Pray for us, my soul, and see to it that we grow more and more in the Savior Christ, as you do. I know you will. Greet your fellow ministers and servants in the work of the Lord, whose sincere prayers I greatly desire to be commended to the heavenly Father. My dear little wife sends her most loving greetings to you and your wife. Farewell again. November 4, 1549. </p>
      <p> Yours, Ambrosius Blarer. </p>
