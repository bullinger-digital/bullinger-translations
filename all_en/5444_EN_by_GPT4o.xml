      <p>God be with you! The long letter that Tschudi wrote in your country is nothing other than that Mendoza, about whom I last wrote to you, who gladly rode and traveled from France to Bern, Lucerne, Zurich, and elsewhere, also acted according to his name. There may be some truth in it; but much is evidently not so, etc.</p>
      <p>As for Turry, I cannot tell you anything other than what I have read; it is a small town between Macon and Chalon. The French names are sometimes not written correctly; I do the same here.</p>
      <p>Siderhar has not come in these eight days (except that Calvin writes to me that the English have come 4000 strong into Normandy, causing great fear to the enemy; whether it is so, I do not know). I cannot write more at this time. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Greet our friends for me.</p>
      <p>Requesting for me about session 2, 3, 4; you could do nothing more pleasant for me. August 28, 62.</p>
      <p>Yours truly.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church of Chur, most esteemed and dear friend and brother. Chur.</p>
