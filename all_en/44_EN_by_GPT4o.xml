    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has received Serin's letter [along with the enclosed writing "De Naemanni adoratione"] and read it despite countless other tasks. He has wished for such a careful examination of the [topic addressed in Serin's writing] for years! His following judgment is free from flattery.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Praise be to God, who addresses his church through Serin's [writing]! Serin should not hide his talent! No pious person could criticize anything in this work! Of course, some will not approve of the writing out of convenience. But Serin should not pay attention to their judgment. The booklet will certainly be very useful!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">However, the following reason moved Bullinger to return the writing: Serin's understandable wish to have it printed before the end of the Augsburg Diet cannot be realized in Zurich. Moreover, it is uncertain whether it can be printed there at all.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">The [printer] Augustin [Mellis, known as] Fries is in great difficulties, which the printing of Serin's work would only exacerbate. In Zurich, the printing of a book is only allowed if it has been fully read by the responsible [book censorship] authorities and if they also know the name, origin, and position of the author. Additionally, the names of the author and the person to whom the book is dedicated must be mentioned [in the print]. The same applies to the place of printing and the name of the printer. Apart from that, the equipment of [Fries's] office may not even be sufficient for the printing.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Christoph Froschauer the Elder and his brother Eustachius Froschauer, on the other hand, are reluctant to print German-language books because they consider them poorly marketable in the current situation. Moreover, they are likely too busy to take on additional orders. Currently, they are printing the following approved writings: Joachim Vadian's revised [and expanded] edition of the "Epitome trium terrae partium"; Bullinger's "Series et digestio temporum"; Theodor Bibliander's "De ratione communi omnium linguarum et literarum commentarius" (A book of demanding and diverse scholarship!); Konrad Gessner's "Pandectarum libri XXI"; as well as the reprint of Bullinger's "In [...] evangelium secundum Ioannem commentariorum libri X".</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Serin should rather have his writing printed by Hans Varnier the Elder in Ulm or in Constance or Basel. If he agrees, Bullinger will gladly send the manuscript personally to his friends in Basel to arrange for the printing there [in the best case]. For this, Serin would need to send him back the print template with his instructions. Undoubtedly, the people in Basel will be willing to do so! Serin should inform Bullinger of his decision in a timely manner.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Enclosed, Serin receives as a gift two small printed handbooks, one on justification ("Iustificatio"), the other on resurrection ("Resurrectio"). Another copy of the "Iustificatio" is intended for Martin Frecht. Bullinger would have liked to include the "Resurrectio" for him as well, but no copy is available. Serin should greet Frecht and ask him not to disdain [the gift].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">There are no news from the Confederation, unless the rumor is new to anyone that Emperor Charles V is planning an attack on it. But since the Confederates know that they have not challenged the Emperor in any way, they call upon God for help and will wait to see what Charles V will do. They continue to agree completely not to give the Emperor or any other prince an opportunity to attack: Should they, in their boundless greed, prepare to attack the Confederates, they will receive them united with God's help! Therefore, it has been ordered throughout the Confederation that everyone must be ready for defense within a few hours. And they have been ready for a long time. The Confederates trust in God's mercy and persistently implore his help. And if God wanted to punish them for their sins and deliver them to the enemies, they will endure it patiently. But Bullinger sees that [in the Confederation] people of every origin, gender, and age completely entrust themselves to God and are ready to die in freedom and true faith rather than submit again to the yoke of servitude and the Antichrist.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">There is a rumor that Pope Paul III (this three-headed beast!) will undertake a military campaign against the Emperor with the help of some kings and princes.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">It is reliable news that some [mercenaries] from the Five Places will set out for the Pope. The Pope has indeed asked for the help of the Confederates, but so far no recognized Swiss political authority is in legal negotiations with the Pope regarding any assistance: It is therefore a private enterprise.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">Furthermore, as written from Basel [18012; 18018], the Hanseatic cities, the Pomeranian dukes [Barnim IX of Pomerania-Stettin and Duke Philip I of Pomerania-Wolgast], and some nobles are said to have gathered an army of 40,000 soldiers in Lower Germany to defend themselves against the Emperor and his followers. However, this is doubtful.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">It is certain that tyranny, presumptuous ambition, and insatiable greed will collapse due to their inherent violence, wherever they may appear in the future.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">May God protect his church forever! Greetings and request for a response.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I have received and read your letter, dearest brother Leonhard, despite being distracted by countless other tasks. I have often wished for this topic to be examined with the utmost diligence. Therefore, I eagerly seized and read what I have longed to read for several years. I speak without flattery, expressing what I truly feel.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I praise our Lord God, who has communicated this to His church through you! I encourage your faith and piety in the Lord Christ, not to hide this talent! I cannot find anything to criticize in the entire work. Nor do I think any pious person will find anything to criticize. I know, however, that some delicate and sensitive Christians will not approve of it. But you should not be concerned with their judgment. I am sure it will bear much fruit.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The reason I am returning it is this: You wish to have the book printed, and indeed before the end of the Augsburg Diet. However, this could not be done here with us. Furthermore, I cannot hope that it will ever be printed here.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>For Augustin Fries is otherwise in distress, and your book would add to his calamity. No one is allowed to print anything unless the book to be printed has first been read in its entirety by the appointed authorities, and unless the name, origin, and status of the author are indicated. Moreover, the author's name must be clearly stated, as well as the name of the person to whom it is dedicated. The place of printing and the name of the printer must also be specified. Even so, he is not equipped in such a way that I can hope for anything.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Christoph and his brother Eustachius are reluctant to print German booklets, as they say they are not very marketable, especially at this time. And indeed, they are so busy that I know for certain they will not take on anything. For they are printing substantial works:</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I therefore advise that either Varner print it, or you send it to Constance or Basel. I offer you my assistance here. For if you send it back with a clear indication of your will, I will gladly send it to my friends in Basel to see if it can be accepted for printing there. And I do not doubt that they will accept it. Therefore, let me know promptly what you decide to do.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I am sending you booklets in the form of a handbook, one on justification, the other on the resurrection of the dead. I ask you to accept these as a gift from me. You will give the one on justification to Mr. Frecht. I would have gladly added the one on resurrection, but there was no more copy available. Therefore, ask him not to disdain this. Greet him most respectfully.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>There is no news with us, unless it seems new to anyone that it is said the Emperor is making an expedition against us. Knowing that we have provoked him in no way, we will await, with God's invoked help, what he intends to attempt. The Swiss have already agreed anew and have agreed that they will not give this or any other prince an occasion to wage war against us. But if they, driven by their own desires, decide to attack us, we will meet them united with God's help. Therefore, it has been ordered throughout Switzerland that everyone be ready at any hour. And they have been ready for a long time and are waiting. We trust in God's mercy and earnestly implore God's help. But if the Lord wishes to punish us for our sins and deliver us into the hands of our enemies, we will indeed bear the hand of the Lord patiently. Yet I see people of all kinds, sexes, and ages are wholly devoted to God and would rather choose to die in freedom and true faith than to be subjected again to the yoke of servitude and the Antichrist.</p>

      <p>There is a rumor with us that the Pope (this three-headed beast!) is making an expedition against the Emperor with the help of some kings and princes.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Indeed, some from the Five Places are said to be going to the Pope. But these are private individuals. No magistrate or republic in all of Switzerland has yet legally engaged with him about providing or not providing assistance. He indeed seeks the help of the Swiss.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Furthermore, it is written from Basel that the maritime and Saxon cities, the dukes of Pomerania, and some nobles have gathered 40,000 soldiers in Lower Germany to defend themselves against the princes adhering to the Emperor and against the Emperor himself. Whether this is true, I doubt.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>It is certain, however, that such tyranny and presumptuous ambition and insatiable greed will collapse under their own weight, wherever the beginning may be.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord that He may preserve His church forever. Farewell with all good things and write back. Zurich, February 15, 1548.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Leonhard Serin in Ulm.</p>
