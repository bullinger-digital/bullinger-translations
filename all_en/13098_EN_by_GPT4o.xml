    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Hotot has the impression that the people of Zurich have completely forgotten him. This is already his third letter to Bullinger. He has also written twice to Konrad Pellikan and Theodor Bibliander. He also wrote three times to his host in Zurich [Georg Rubli], who had agreed to send his luggage to Bern. None of them have ever replied! How can that be? There is no shortage of travelers between Zurich and Bern, and he has not just arrived in Bern! It must be due to unfortunate circumstances or the negligence of some people who have claimed to be his friends! And if the latter is true, he has good reason to be annoyed about it. However, he prefers that it happens to him rather than being guilty of it himself, especially since he always fears proving to be negligent towards others and especially friends. Such a thing is indeed inexcusable! Now he sends with this young man [...] a final letter to the people of Zurich, who seem to be so unaccommodating to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Greetings, also from Jodocus Kilchmeyer. If Bullinger wishes, he should also convey his greetings to Pellikan and Bibliander.</p>

      <p>I believe you have all completely forgotten about me. This is the third letter I am writing to you. I have written twice to Herr Pellikan and Herr Bibliander. I also wrote the same number of times to my host, who had agreed to send my luggage here, as I did to you. I have received nothing from anyone, and I cannot quite understand how this can be. For I cannot blame a lack of travelers coming here, nor a shortage of time, nor anything else, unless I attribute it to my misfortune or to the negligence of those who have claimed to be my friends in person. If I (as I should) take this badly, I would rather it be a fault in me than in others by me, since I have always feared appearing negligent to anyone, especially towards friends, or at least those worthy of my friendship. I have considered it unjust to neglect such duties. This young man conveniently presented himself to me, through whom I am writing to you for the last time, as I see you so disdain my efforts.</p>

      <p>Herr Jodocus sends you his regards. You may convey the same on my behalf to Herren Pellikan and Bibliander (if you please). Farewell. Bern, 21 October 1547. Yours most devotedly, Jean de Hotot.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, outstanding in learning and virtue, Herr Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the Church of Zurich. From Zurich.</p>
