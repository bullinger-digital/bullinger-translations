    <p xml:id="regest1">What the intention of the French King regarding the situation of the Church is, Bullinger has already learned from du Bellay earlier. There is hope that unity will be achieved in religious matters. Du Bellay thinks it is a good idea to send Ulrich Chelius to Zurich, who will convey further advice.</p>

      <p>Greetings. What the intention, mind, spirit, and thought of my king is regarding the state of the Church, you have indeed heard from me before. The matter itself will soon prove its truth, and not a small stimulus has been added to it, or rather hope has been instilled in accomplishing the task according to the opinions of the good, which I have taught him from your words that much time, much of your advice has softened things that seemed harsher to us, thus delaying the restoration of unity. Meanwhile, it seemed to me and indeed will be the case, if I send to you Mr. Ulrich Chelius, who will both communicate to you the advice and thoughts of some on this matter and encourage you to take the same care, which should be the concern of all, indeed of everyone.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Paris, the day before the calends of November 1534.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly</p>
      <p>Guillaume du Bellay.</p>
      <p>To the most learned men, Mr. Konrad Pellikan and Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
