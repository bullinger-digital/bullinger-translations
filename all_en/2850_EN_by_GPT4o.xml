      <p>I have sent you two letters, beloved father, written in the same manner, in which I believe I have sufficiently explained to you the entire course of my life and studies. Now, since I have certain people to whom I can entrust letters, I wanted to inform you of my expenses for this half-year with this present letter, which are as follows: Creditor Mr. Conrad RÃ¼elius of Wittenberg, to whom I had entrusted my money for safekeeping, lent me 18 florins and 15 batzen 3 kreuzer beyond what he had received from Froschauer in Frankfurt. I undoubtedly spent this money, beyond your expectation and hope, partly for the use of necessary things, partly for books necessary for the course of my studies, as I account for each item in detail in the sent schedule. For I did not waste or squander it uselessly, as the honest and upright man Mr. Rodolphus Collinus, who is now returning to his homeland, can testify about me in good faith. This large sum of money consumed in one winter will seem entirely foreign to you, dear father, I am sure. But truly, at this time, I could not live more frugally; for I bought only necessary books, and I could not acquire sustenance at a lower price without great detriment to my health, and I obtained other necessary things not without considerable expense.</p>
      <p>Finally, I also paid money for private lessons. All of this, beloved father, if you consider and weigh it carefully, the matter itself, namely the literary study, in which I have invested these great expenses, I hope you will accept this account of my expenses with a fair and benevolent mind and further, as long as it can be done by your will, you will supply them to me, which I earnestly beg from you and my beloved mother. I pray to the eternal God the Father to grant the help of His grace, so that, instructed in doctrine and piety, I may soon return to my homeland with glory and be an honor to you, my dear parents, and the whole family. The remaining thing I wanted to inform you about in my previous letters to you (which I believe have been delivered to you) was that I wrote asking for a Latin dictionary to be sent through Froschauer in Frankfurt, who would then procure it for me in Wittenberg; I am now expecting it. Furthermore, I wrote to Mr. Froschauer for two other books: a copy of the Latin Bible in the Latin version of the Zurichers for the reason that many things occur in my Bible that I cannot understand without some interpretation. However, they always have an added interpretation of obscure words in the margin with prefixed arguments of each chapter, and it is such as you use in the pulpit during preaching. The other book I wrote for contains the orations of Isocrates with the Latin version by Hieronymus Wolf. I have read several orations of this book and see that it will be very useful to me in learning the Greek language.</p>
      <p>Please do not disdain to pay for these useful books in my name to Mr. Froschauer, I beg you.</p>
      <p>I had nothing new to write about, except that various rumors are spread among us: about the Turk, they say he will besiege the city of Vienna, others say he has already attacked and captured the castle of the city; but almost all are contrary to the truth. A comet appeared here in Wittenberg for 14 days now, looking towards the north and resembling a rod, which undoubtedly signifies the wrath of God impending upon us great sinners; therefore, it should rightly be an incitement for us to fear God and amend our lives. I am now sending the book I wrote about above, the "Farrago of Sentences" with the booklet by Schnepf on the sacrament and some other pictures, etc. To Mr. Zwingli, Mr. Lavater, and Mr. Simler, relatives, I send with the books of Rodolphus Collinus the land of Palestine, the Genealogy of Christ, and the Calendar of Eber, etc., whom you should greet most diligently in my name and convey my many greetings to my mother and the whole family. Farewell, my dearest father, and continue to love me, your son.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, your beloved son, in Wittenberg in Saxony.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his most beloved father. In Zurich.</p>
      <p>Wittenberg, March 7, 1556.</p>
