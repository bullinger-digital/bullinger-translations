      <p>Greetings. If the letters had not been delivered to me by Evichius after the departure of Thretius, which he requested to be sent to you, I would not have written anything now, because there is nothing that seems worthy of writing. Mr. Ursinus also sent me enclosed letters, in which he writes to you about the affairs of the Wittenbergers. Among other things, Evichius writes to me:</p>
      <p>"Our people in Zürich also wrote nothing during the past fairs, as far as I know; this matter troubles me not a little." For indeed, the matter is one of anxious and fearful love."</p>
      <p>But especially, I was stirred by the mentions and promises of certain new commentaries. I do not know what has happened, and I am afraid; for I understand nothing yet through the booksellers." Also: "With us, there is little that would be pleasing for you to hear, except that the harmony of religion is almost intact for us now, although not yet as fruitful as it should be." I was pleased to write these things hastily, so that you may see that I am always mindful of you. In Christ our Lord, farewell most happily. Amen.</p>
      <p>Thomas Erastus, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the Zürich church, my lord to be honored like a father.</p>
