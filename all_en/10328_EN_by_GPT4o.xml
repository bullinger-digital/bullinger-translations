    <p xml:id="regest1">In contrast to Bullinger's pessimistic last letter No. 296, the council elections in Zürich have been successful for the friends of the Reformation: Many of them have been elected to the Small Council. Rumors of a large amount of French ? gold in Zürich. Bullinger requests news.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I wrote in my previous letters out of great mental disturbance, what was pressing[!]. Now, in turn, receive what the mind's concerns have somewhat more freely discussed. On December 13th, contrary to the wishes of the papists, the best were elected to the council: Nikolaus Brunner, a certain Schneeberger, not a bad man, and some good men from the dioceses. Furthermore, a weight of gold was found, about which, if they tell the truth and I myself ascertain the whole truth, I will report some remarkable things.</p>
      <p>If you have anything from the Diet of Augsburg or about the alliance of the Pope and the French, write immediately. We have no news here.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>December 14, 1533.</p>
      <p>Hein. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant president of the Basel church, Mr. Oswald Myconius, dearest brother and fellow minister.</p>
