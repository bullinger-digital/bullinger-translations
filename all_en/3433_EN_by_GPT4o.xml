      <p>Greetings. I have now also seen your letters, in which you write to us about baptism.</p>
      <p>In them, you complain that I have written nothing to you... most illustrious one, I did not think it necessary to do so, because for several weeks after the arrival of our Fabricius, I had received nothing from you, from which I could not help but suspect that my letters would no longer be pleasing to you, even though later the same Fabricius informed me that you, in your kindness, always greet me in your letters, and even show me your letters whenever you write something noteworthy.</p>
      <p>Finally, he always writes to your kindness and in his letters conveys my greetings to you. Because of this, I thought it superfluous to burden you with my nonsense.</p>
      <p>What you write about baptism, it is not for me to condemn. However, let it be permissible to say something.</p>
      <p>In our alliances, we ministers have so far baptized those who were baptized by non-preachers of the word, when asked, for this reason above all: There were communities that, seeing baptism administered by laypeople not being condemned, began to baptize children among themselves and no longer desired a minister of the word. To suppress the foolish and harmful attempts of these people (since no other option was given), we decreed that no one should baptize except a preacher of the word, and praised that baptism which was administered by a minister, so that sacred preachers would not be excluded and churches would not be without pastors. In my Engadin, a not small sedition is growing among people there who do not sufficiently observe certain rights, which Ferdinand, the Roman king, has always had there until this day. Our lords have hastily sent two envoys there.</p>
      <p>The matter is too lengthy to be fully described in brief. In the same Engadin, a certain truthful man wrote to me that three suns were seen these days, one being the true one from the east, the second in the middle region of the sky, the third showing itself from the west. At the beginning of November, a light was also seen in the sky... very bright with thunder quite audible...</p>
      <p>In my Engadin, a not small sedition is growing among those people who do not sufficiently observe certain rights, which Ferdinand, the Roman king, has always had there until this day. Our lords have hastily sent two envoys there.</p>
      <p>Finally, if you do not refuse to hear this as well: Our Fabricius initially seemed to me arrogant and haughty; now I see him having become more prudent and worthy of that commendation of yours, with which you recommended him to me.</p>
      <p>From Chur, on the 13th of December in the year 1557.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord.</p>
