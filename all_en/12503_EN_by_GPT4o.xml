    <p xml:id="regest1">Due to a lack of messengers, Frey can only now send a copy [of Bullinger's work "On the True Justification of a Christian Man" which appeared in Bern]. In the translation, he mostly adapted the Bible quotes to the text of older [German] Bible translations to avoid offending the Papists. Unfortunately, this edition contains many printing errors. In the enclosed copy, they have been carefully noted so that [Christoph] Froschauer could reprint the work in Zurich if necessary. An introduction was also included in the present dispatch. Should there be a reprint, Bullinger can decide whether Frey's name should be mentioned (knowing well that the people of Bern and Baden might take offense), and whether Frey's introduction should appear unchanged, in an edited form, or be omitted altogether. Since Frey is ashamed of the many errors in this edition, he has not sent copies to friends and family members. Bullinger should apologize to the relevant people on Frey's behalf.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- He encloses the promised calendar. Bullinger should keep this treasure well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- He also sends him a treatise by Calvin on the Lord's Supper ["Libellus de coena Domini"]. The people of Biel expect a judgment on it from the people of Zurich. [Guillaume] Farel and [Pierre] Viret, who were recently in Strasbourg to advocate for the persecuted [Waldensians], have now joined the opinion of the increasingly numerous "meat-eaters." On his return journey, Farel told [in Biel] that Bucer had helped Viret to a better understanding. Michael [Schlatter] tried in vain to dispute this with Farel. He said that the people of Biel would not understand the matter, but that he would pray for them. Since he reached this new insight, he feels God's work more strongly during the Lord's Supper. He further said that even Zwingli (if he had not died) would understand that the body of Christ, even though it is in heaven, feeds us in an incomprehensible way; indeed, that through the work of the Holy Spirit, Christ's presence is even more real than that of the bodies close to us! May one escape this cunning!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings from Frey's wife [...], who sincerely thanks for the services rendered. Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander] and [Rudolf] Gwalther.</p>

      <p>Greetings from God through Jesus Christ. I am finally sending (dearest father) this booklet translated by me, but not as I wished, as it is full of errors everywhere, and the messenger arrived later than I had hoped. The passages cited from the scriptures, I did not translate, but copied them as they were already translated (with few exceptions), to remove any opportunity for the Papists to slander. I reviewed the booklet with as much diligence as I could, so that if it seems worthwhile, it may be published in Zurich in a more polished form. For this reason, I have also added this brief preliminary (vorangestellten) letter, clearly explaining my intention. I showed it to the brothers, who do not disapprove, but say that the people of Bern might complain about me if they see it printed in Zurich at my instigation. Therefore, it would be better if Froschauer published it without adding my name, as if it were from himself. Do what seems best to you. I do not care at all. For why should I command others, they will easily see, whoever compares the old copies with the new ones. Therefore, either correct, change, or even completely reject my letter. I know that with this effort of mine, I am pouring oil on the fire long kindled in Baden, but God is my bronze wall. I had intended to send individual copies to each person, but I did not dare to send such impure ones. In this regard, you will excuse me to my friends and relatives.</p>

      <p>We are awaiting your judgment on the dissertation by Calvin, which I sent, concerning the matter of the Eucharist. Our "meat-eaters" continue, and their number increases daily. Farel is entirely with them, who now on his return from Viret said (for he passed through us on his way to Strasbourg due to the French persecution, sent without him), that he has been in agreement with us until now, but after hearing Bucer, he gave the highest thanks to God, that what seemed most absurd to him before, he now sees so clearly. Michael of ours discussed much with him, but in vain. He says we do not grasp the matter and that we must pray for God to reveal it to us; for whenever he celebrates the supper, he feels more nourishment than he did when his faith was weaker; also, if Zwingli were alive, we would all agree that the body of the Lord is indeed locally in heaven, but nevertheless, beyond all human reason, nourishes us with his present flesh and blood, as John 6 says and the words of the supper have. And since the Lord does not deceive us, by the working of the Holy Spirit, Christ's body is more present to him than our bodies, even though they are very close. May God grant us, that by persisting in true faith, we may escape all the tricks of all impostors! Amen.</p>

      <p>Our people greet you, especially my wife greets you and all yours, to whom she also gives the highest thanks for the benefits shown. Greet yours in my name, also Lord Theodor, Gwalther, etc. Farewell. Biel/Bienne, June 6, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johann Leopold Frey.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest father. Zurich.</p>
