      <p>The letters from our Polish brothers were delivered to us so late that we truly fear the matter may be settled before ours reach them. However, we would prefer to respond late than to neglect our duty, and since the matter seems full of obvious danger, we would rather incur some expenses to convey our thoughts through the mouth of a messenger than through writings that could be preserved or intercepted. The person we have chosen is a man of proven trust, of noble birth, and from the family of the former admiral, from whom you will learn many private details about that massacre, as he pursued the assassin who wounded the admiral and was miraculously saved when he took refuge in the school of our Ramus. He lacks fluency in the Latin language; but this, I am sure, you will excuse, and in Krakau, he will find our Thenaud, who, if necessary, will serve as an interpreter. He will communicate everything to you and will also report what you have sent to us. Furthermore, I earnestly and repeatedly ask you, my father, to ensure that our messenger reaches Nürnberg without danger, as far as possible, and without delay, and there you should recommend him to a sincere and honest friend, who will also ensure that he is brought to Krakau without delay and risk, and there delivered into the hands of our d. Thretio with all his documents so secretly that not even the slightest rumor of his arrival is spread.</p>
      <p>I would have written to Nürnberg to d. Herdesian and d. Durnhofer, about whose willingness and faith I have no more doubt than about myself; but I prefer that this be done by you.</p>
      <p>Genf, the day before the calends of May 1573.</p>
