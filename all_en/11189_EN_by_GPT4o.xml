      <p>Greetings. Concerning Rudolf, I earnestly ask, since I have not yet responded, do not think that I am following reasons that would hardly befit our friendship. My affairs are such now that I do not see how he could be with me, whom I could very much bear to have with me. As can be easily gathered, my mind is greatly troubled.</p>
      <p>I am very disturbed, my dear Bullinger; this longing for my sister pursues me more grievously than I initially thought. The recent wound did not have this pain. The Lord knows the state of my mind now; I can barely sustain myself. I wish and would desire to have more strength, but what can you do. Therefore, I wish, if it is possible, that you allow him to stay there for a little while. As soon as I can determine something more certain about myself, I will respond to you very amicably.</p>
      <p>We have appointed Otto as the head of our school in place of Melchior. This was done with the good grace of both. You yourself should also encourage him to diligently perform his duty, especially towards the children of Zurich, who now look up to him greatly.</p>
      <p>Regarding other matters, I hope everything is well. I have written to Luther a letter that is not long, but still candid. I hope the Lord Christ will grant us that all the pious may rejoice with one heart in our salvation and glorify our redeemer. Amen.</p>
      <p>Greet Leo, Pellican, and everyone diligently. Farewell in Christ. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your Grynäus.</p>
      <p>To his dearest Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
