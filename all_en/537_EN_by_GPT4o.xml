      <p>Strasbourg, 30th May 1549.</p>
      <p>Greetings. I received your recent letter delivered by a noble Pole, dear friend and master Bullinger; in which I understand you are surprised that you have not received anything from Lord Richard, nor from Hooper, nor from anyone else from England. I dare to respond on behalf of our friend Richard, that he is not forgetful of you, but will write at the first opportunity, as he promised. However, he is hindered by very great affairs and by his inexperience with the Latin language and writing, which he often blames; or rather by the fear of making a mistake in writing. Moreover, he is not accustomed to writing rumors and hearsay, but truth; and because of this, he very rarely writes news to me: but what he writes is usually true. Therefore, I do not doubt that when he knows something true and certain about the state of our England, he will write it both to me and to you. A book on religion has been published, and that with the consent of the nobles and the entire council, which we call the parliament, but it has not yet been printed: I do not doubt that he will send it as soon as it is published. Bucer and Paulus Fagius have safely arrived in England, and have written here from the court of Canterbury. I hope they are not corrupted or made worse! John a Lasco has left England, but will return there. John Hooper and his companions have safely arrived in Antwerp, and are finally in England. He wrote to me from Antwerp, (he wishes?) that I should greet you and the whole church in the name of him and his wife.</p>
      <p>About the Emperor, nothing, except that he is still in Brussels, although there was a rumor that he had gone to Ghent. It was also said that he would come to Speyer, and it is certain that the people of Speyer have prepared lodgings for him and his entourage; but a stronger rumor has come, namely that he will not come.</p>
      <p>The King of France, as usual, violates the treaty and peace with the English. For he attacked Boulogne with great force seven times in one day, but to his own detriment; for he was repelled as many times with not a small loss of soldiers. The Scots, relying on the promises of the French, are becoming insolent, but to their great harm: for again two hundred of them were killed by our men, five hundred captured. The Emperor, as I hear, has granted our king ten thousand foot soldiers and five hundred horsemen for the defense of Boulogne. I wish I could write about peace rather than war! That the Frenchman calls the Swiss for the defense or rather the recovery of Boulogne, he does not do unwisely; but the Swiss would act most imprudently if they agreed, for it is too far from you. However, I wish the Swiss would interpose themselves between these two princes, to negotiate peace and that under some just conditions, by which it could be recovered and secured! For it is to be feared that, while the mouse and the frog fight, the eagle may devour both. About our Strasbourg, these things are to be written, namely that beyond all human expectation we remain as before; nothing has changed, except that in the meantime festival days and fasting are prescribed.</p>
      <p>Pray to the Lord for us constantly both in your private and public prayers and give thanks with us for this divine benefit of His. Greet your wife and all the learned men in my name.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Your Burcher, the Englishman.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, a far dear friend in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
