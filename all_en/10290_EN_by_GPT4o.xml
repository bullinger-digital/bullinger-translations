      <p>Well-learned, gracious, dear lord and brother in the Lord, with all due respect I commend myself to your service, with unwavering hope that twelve pious men will still receive a shilling. I understand you have let the story of the 12 apostles go out, and also written against the Anabaptists. I would like to have it. I would earnestly ask you to provide this to the bearer; he would pay for it, etc.</p>
      <p>I have been informed that the Six Cantons have made some agreements concerning faith with the Pope and the Duke of Milan. If that is the case, in what manner, inform me, so you will soon learn where the rabbit is in the pepper. May God bring it to the best.</p>
      <p>I would like to end my life in Zurich, if there were unity, as it should rightfully be, and how you might advise me, how I might conduct myself in coming to you, I would earnestly ask you to write me everything in detail. If that comes to fruition, I would repay (reward) you.</p>
      <p>Dated Maienfeld, on the 16th day of September in the year 1533.</p>
      <p>Your willing Martin Seger, bailiff of Maienfeld.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, my especially gracious, dear lord and brother in the Lord.</p>
