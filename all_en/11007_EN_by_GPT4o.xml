    <p xml:id="regest1">The prohibition of Bucer's "Retraktionen" criticized by Bullinger was not decided as such; however, the people of Bern reject the Four Cities and the Augsburg Confession and fear that Basel might distance itself from the common standpoint in the concord issue. The relationship between Bern and Freiburg is similar to that between Jacob and Esau. The envoys who intervened in France on behalf of the [faith] refugees have not yet returned; at the French court as well as in Venice, Turkish envoys are being preferentially received. Megander regrets the appointment of [Johannes] Fries to Zurich, as he wanted to bring him to the new theological school in Lausanne; he inquires about Fries' predecessor [Benedikt] Finsler. A dispute has erupted between Caroli and Viret over intercessions for the deceased; [in Bern] it was negotiated for two days. Several Frenchmen in the recently conquered territories are suspected of heresy; Calvin has therefore pushed for the convening of a synod, but has been postponed until after Easter. The people of Zurich are probably already aware of the events in Denmark. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Who would not take kindly to a friendly and brotherly admonition about not proscribing Bucer's "Retractations," my dearest Bullinger? However, it was not at all discussed, let alone decided, among us as I understand it was reported to you and Leo; indeed, everything was under condition and only by some of the brothers, as we also responded to the people of Basel. I seem to see, my dearest Bullinger, the entire catastrophe of the story, that is, how some want to establish concord. But, to reveal the truth to you, we will not accept obscure and ambiguous matters, just as you do not, and thus neither the Four Cities nor the Saxon (as they say) confession. Furthermore, to hold nothing back from you, I fear that the people of Basel may draw us into open dangers with them. The men and brothers have never been suspect to me; but I fear somewhat that they have defected from us, which I wish to tell you.</p>
      <p>As for your inquiry about how we get along with the people of Freiburg: Certainly well, I answer, just as Jacob once did with his brother Esau.</p>
      <p>The envoys sent to the King of France on behalf of the exiles have not yet returned, nor do we expect them to return immediately unless the matter is unresolved; for, if what is commonly reported is true, they have not yet been deemed worthy of a royal audience. That tyrant, our neighbor and supposed supporter (as they say), values us so highly. For he had to receive the Turkish delegation before ours. It is also certain that the Venetians did the same, as a trustworthy man wrote. For on January 15, a Turk arrived in Venice, who was received most honorably by the senate and led to the palace of Saint Mark.</p>
      <p>A school will certainly be established in Lausanne, not only a literary school but also a theological lecture, as I recently informed you. Therefore, it is not so pleasing that Fries has been appointed to the abbey school. For I had certain hopes for the man. The plan was approved by Calvin, Charles, and the brothers Viret. You do not write what has been done about Vinsler, my wife's relative, since he has occupied the aforementioned position until now.</p>
      <p>A not insignificant controversy has arisen between Charles and Viret, ministers of the church in Lausanne, concerning the bodies of the deceased. For Charles wanted the Catholic Church to have always piously prayed for all the faithful and still to pray that they be delivered from death and that the bodies of the deceased may attain the life of the world to come. But Viret was of a completely different opinion, indeed that it is not at all necessary to ask the Lord to awaken the bodies destined to rise at the appointed time. We contended vigorously about this matter for two days; but how the matter was settled, I do not write at present.</p>
      <p>Finally, some Frenchmen in the newly occupied territory are suspected of having incorrect views about Christ and the Trinity of persons. For this reason, Calvin, coming to Bern, earnestly requested that a synod be convened, which was denied to the man until after Easter. See how much trouble those superstitious, not to say seditious, French are causing us.</p>
      <p>Regarding the kingdom of Denmark and the matter of its bishops, there is no need to inform you much, as you undoubtedly already know the matter.</p>
      <p>These are the things I wanted to make known to you at present, my dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In Bern, March 8, in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>John Rhellicanus and all the brothers greet you. Please greet Leo, Theodor, Bellicanus, and all the brothers in my name.</p>
      <p>Megander, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, his singular brother in the Lord, most beloved.</p>
