      <p>My good will always serves you as before and hereby to inform you.</p>
      <p>As it happens to me, how you do not know how my lords and their preachers have agreed and parted, therefore I send you good, faithful opinion, so that you may receive the report. And if it pleases you, you may well copy it and also inform Caspar Großmann in secret, so that I am not accused and reported as a gossip. However, I desire you to send me the same back, with an urgent request to you, to also send me something you have made. Namely, I am informed that you have made a fine piece about the providence of God. And although you have made it in Latin, it is my urgent request to you, if it were possible, to send me the same in German; for I well think, you have perhaps since then translated it into German for good fellows. Whatever it would cost to write such, I would willingly bear to you or your substitute.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife, my cousin, and brother-in-law Hans for me. And with the offer, where I could be of service to you or yours, you should always find me willing, God willing. May He graciously protect you.</p>
      <p>Given at Königsfelden, on February 16, 1538. Your always willing brother-in-law Hans Ulrich Zehender, steward at Königsfelden.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, highly esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the word and servant of the church in Zurich, my beloved lord and brother-in-law.</p>
