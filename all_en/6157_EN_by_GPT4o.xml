      <p>Greetings. I received your letter yesterday in Aarau, and since you cannot come to us, which we greatly desired, behold, as I had forewarned, Mr. Claudius from Madiis is coming up to you.</p>
      <p>He wishes to meet with you alone and therefore asks that you would be so kind as to come to his lodging; for soon after he has spoken with you, he will depart again so that he can be with us tomorrow at the synod or chapter in Brugg.</p>
      <p>We left Aarau very late yesterday, so that shortly before nightfall we arrived here in Lenzburg with the prefect, where we also spent the night.</p>
      <p>Now I, together with another colleague, am setting out for KÃ¶nigsfelden, where I have no doubt my brother is waiting for me. Farewell.</p>
      <p>From the castle in Lenzburg, early morning on the first of June, 1564. Your Haller.</p>
