      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. There is not much to discuss with you about our affairs, honorable man. Indeed, we are lukewarm and lazy; we abuse the freedom obtained through Christ for our own desires, and although we are afflicted by the dearness and scarcity of all things, we do not care to amend our lives in the least. Nor can I write anything certain about our bishop. He left for Rome 14 months ago and is detained there by the Roman bishop, in a way as a captive; for he is not free to return to his own; the reason is unknown. He is accused and charged with Lutheranism, but undeservedly; the entrenched tyranny deals with him as it always has. The Bishop of Bergamo is held captive in Rome; a recall is demanded from him, and he will be freed. Our own bishop is not only most ready to recall, if there were any faults, but also to abjure, and yet he cannot be freed. Many things are reported among us about the Baden Diet, but obscurely; we ask to be informed by you, also about the most unmerciful Emperor and other matters. Farewell in the Lord Jesus most happily. From the Court of Rhaetia, 12th October 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>Philippus Gallitius, Heimius, and Tscharner send you many greetings.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in piety and learning, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the church of ZÃ¼rich, his primary lord and friend.</p>
