      <p>Greetings. I have received everything you sent and I thank you greatly for these.</p>
      <p>I read what you wrote about the acts of the council and then gave it to Lord von Mülinen; I also advised him that if he wanted to respond, he should send it to me; but he has not sent anything yet.</p>
      <p>Regarding what you wrote about the acts of the Savoyard envoy with us, I informed Mr. Steiger; he reported to me that the same envoy also proposed and indicated to our people that he wants to complain about this injustice to all the Swiss cantons. Our people think the matter is fabricated; meanwhile, they leave it unresolved.</p>
      <p>The Genevans will be able to clear themselves if they are innocent. However, unexpectedly, our people have again granted that a meeting of both parties in Neuchâtel is set and established for the first of May; it will deal with the restoration of religion and the people of Glarus. I wish that if peace can be made, the Genevans would also accommodate themselves to it; otherwise, I fear they might eventually bring about a serious war for themselves and us. Furthermore, we have no news from France, except that the king is certainly reported to be coming to Lyon; why this will happen is explained in various ways by many. May the Lord ensure that he brings no harm with him! We have no news from Germany as our merchants have not yet returned from the Frankfurt fairs.</p>
      <p>If you have received anything from there or from England, I beg you to share it with us as well. Meanwhile, in these days, after Mr. Steiger completed his two-year consulship, Negelinus succeeded him again. Mr. Nikolaus Diesbach, our esteemed godfather and friend, has been restored to the diacosios and soon to his old place in the senate with the highest congratulations from all the good people; additionally, newly elected to the senate are Mr. Albert von Erlach, German Gentsch, and Johannes Müller. I return to you the letters of Fabrizio and Count Martinengo and thank you; I also return those Tübingen axioms, the complexity of which I truly cannot understand. For neither in the scriptures nor in the fathers do I find such confusion; what they affirm now, they soon deny and attribute a triple body to Christ, thus creating a certain three-bodied Geryon. May the Lord have mercy on this blindness and reveal His simple truth to the whole world. Amen.</p>
      <p>I have not yet seen Brentius's book nor do I wish to see it; for my stomach and all my intestines ache whenever I read such things. However, I am grateful that you sent these to me so that I could show them here to those who boast about these women as if they were Bernese.</p>
      <p>Mr. Haller, who after his previous misfortune has suffered another no less serious, as you will learn from my brother, greets you; he endures everything patiently. Mr. Steiger, Diesbach, my father-in-law, wife, brothers, and all friends also greet you. May your wife, sons, daughters, and sons-in-law all be well.</p>
      <p>May the Lord protect us from all evil and keep you especially safe for us for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>Bern, April 6, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
