      <p>S. D. You have kept your promise, son. For now, I have received your letters for the first time, along with the treatise by Mr. Zanchi on restraining heretics, which you sent long ago on July 6th; where they have been in the meantime, I do not know. I see and experience the vain and unreliable trustworthiness of couriers.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you should see to whom you entrust letters, especially those which you consider to be of some importance. In my last letters, I reproached you for not writing anything from the fairs; now I see that this was not your fault, but someone else's mistake, although one should always be diligent in whom they trust with letters. If you had trusted our couriers, they would have been delivered to me long ago; but from this, I infer that you still have some careless and negligent ones; otherwise, you could have sent these letters without any trouble. You do nothing about a matter until it cannot get worse; then you cry and make no progress.</p>
      <p>I would very much like to know who delivered to you those letters which you enclosed; for they were brought to you from Frisia; I do not wish to know in vain from whom you received them, etc.</p>
      <p>I expect, as I had requested, your final account of expenses up to September 1st, so that I know what is left of the 8 crowns, which I sent to you when you departed to Burcher through our Froschauer.</p>
      <p>I wrote to Mr. Herr, that he should clothe you for the necessities of winter and not for excess or vanity; I cannot afford it, nor do I want to. See to it that you show yourself to be frugal, honorable, and obedient. I am not against necessity. Use the clothes sparingly and keep them clean.</p>
      <p>The treatise you sent is incomplete and faulty; however, I commend your effort, but I require greater diligence, and you should respond to such expenses with great progress. Farewell. We are all well by the grace of God. May the Lord bless you and be gracious to you. Respond to this and to my last letters, which I sent through Spiller and Bertsch. Dated August 25th, 1554.</p>
      <p>See to it that the letters destined for Frisia are diligently and faithfully handled by Gabriel the tanner from Cologne. If he is to remain in Strasbourg for a long time and is not going to the fairs and to Frisia, see that you give the letters to Mr. Christoph Froschauer, asking him to diligently handle them in Frankfurt, or give the letters to the Frisian counts who are with you; for I am writing to their mother, the countess.</p>
      <p>The letters are enclosed here. Farewell again. Write how you have handled this.</p>
      <p>To my beloved son Heinrich Bullinger in the house of Mr. John Burcher, the Englishman.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg.</p>
