      <p>Greetings and Peace. I received your letter dated November 24th, in which you show me all paternal kindness, as you not only write about things you thought I would want to know, but also express your desire to learn about me and my affairs. This clearly demonstrates your affection towards me and your piety towards our nation as well. I hold your affection, most esteemed father, in such high regard that I confess I am already greatly indebted to you for your merits in the church of Jesus Christ, and I will strive to ensure that you may one day consider your care for me and my people not to have been in vain. As for my health, I am managing here despite the Geneva air being generally harmful to all newcomers; sometimes I experience bouts of illness, which, although not so dangerous that I cannot bear them, are nevertheless so troublesome to me that, having come here for the sake of my studies, from which it is in itself very difficult to be torn away, I am not able to enjoy them freely as I would like due to my affected and exercised body.</p>
      <p>However, I never neglect my studies. I diligently study the Holy Bible, to which I add your books on the Christian religion, which we call the Decades, along with Calvin's Institutes and sometimes Musculus's Common Places. I also dedicate certain hours to ecclesiastical histories and compare the form of the ancient church with that of our times. I am now devoting considerable effort to the Greek and Hebrew languages, so much so that I am not displeased with the progress I have made in them, and I have resolved to spend this entire winter in these studies, unless some event disrupts my plans.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of spring, if our circumstances seem to require it, another plan will need to be adopted. Regarding what you write about the boys, nothing could be more pleasing, and I wish they would conduct themselves with Laurentius in such a way that they might please you and your dearest wife. I will consider myself greatly benefited by them if they achieve this through their respect towards you. I am also very glad that you have spoken with Laurentius, for which I offer you great thanks. He has always seemed somewhat harsh to me and naturally a bit difficult to approach with ease and affability, especially since the boys themselves are quite modest and ready and willing to follow orders.</p>
      <p>I had initially advised him on this matter and was planning to renew my advice, but I will refrain until I am advised by you, if necessary. Nor will I say a word to him about it.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, I beg your kindness to continue to protect them in the same love you have once taken them into, and to deal with Laurentius with your authority whenever necessary. I thought excessive punishment would be detrimental to their character; however, if any is needed, I would not want it to be done by Laurentius without your command. But they, along with me, give thanks to the most gracious God, who in His divine providence has given them a father as kind as you, under whose rule and protection they will feel no violence or injury. May Almighty God reward you for this patronage with His mercy.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, most illustrious lord, I am very sorry that no letters have arrived from Poland from their father. The reason is undoubtedly the occupation of the noble lord in military matters, who is far from Poland. However, if the letters that Sebastian Koczler sent to Lindau were lost, it would cause us great sorrow, which God forbid.</p>
      <p>And since you are making such an effort to recover them, you are doing something not only most pleasing but also most useful to us. If they are ever recovered and come into your hands, and if there are any that pertain to me, if you send them, you will send me comfort in my current tedium. I am equally sorry that Sebastian Koczler is so difficult in transmitting letters. I fear he may have neglected mine, which I sent many from France, as he sends no reply.</p>
      <p>What you write about Lord Johannes Brunner was not very pleasing to me, although I congratulate him on his successful outcome. I am certain he would have been well provided for in Poland, where he could have had an annual income of one hundred and fifty talers. But I am more affected by the fact that you say you cannot have anyone else suitable for this position. They are undoubtedly expecting someone from here; but perhaps they will be disappointed in their hope.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, where necessary, you will bear witness to my diligence. Farewell, most illustrious and pious man and most kind father, together with your dearest wife, a most pious woman.</p>
      <p>Given in Geneva on the 4th day before the Ides of December, 1561.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Lord Simler, whose teaching and sanctity of character I always praise, and to the most learned Zwingli, I send many greetings and offer my services. Most devoted and respectful to you, Christoph Thretius, a Pole.</p>
