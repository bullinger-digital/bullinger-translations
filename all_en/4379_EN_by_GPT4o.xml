      <p>Joy and peace in Christ.</p>
      <p>In these days, I encountered our venerable old man, Master Matthias Erb, most learned man, whom I found almost deathly sad; for he saw that an almost incurable wound was being inflicted on the church, which he has hitherto led by teaching. Behold, (alas) two apostles have flown in from the Duchy of Württemberg, one of whom would succeed the living Matthias and be the superintendent of the entire county, while the other would almost expel Master Jacob Milyagrius. For both Matthias and Jacob have received their sentence from the magistrate, which they have eagerly awaited until now: the former to depart from the entire county and duchy, and the latter to indeed enjoy his stipend, which he has lived on until now, but to desist from the duty of preaching. I wanted to communicate this to you quickly with great sorrow, so that you might understand the state of our churches and diligently intercede for us with the Lord; for they are in great peril. May the Lord God have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers in my name, and especially Master Rudolf Walther, to whom I would have written if leisure had permitted.</p>
      <p>Given hastily in Mulhouse at the house of Finck, who wishes you well, on the 3rd of August. Your most observant Thomas Schöpf, doctor of medicine.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and equally pious Master Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy preacher of the divine word among the people of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and friend. In Zürich.</p>
