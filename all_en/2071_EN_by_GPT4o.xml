      <p>S. P. D. Today, I have received your most delightful letters along with your most learned and sincere response to the people of Geneva, for which I offer you the thanks I can. However, I ask you to let me know in a couple of lines, when you have time, whether you think it was entirely right to have acted as they did with Servetus, by removing him from the living in that manner of death. I believe that most stubborn instrument of Satan deserved two deaths, let alone one, and this will serve as an example and a terror to those who can scarcely be corrected or restrained otherwise. But some assert that this was not permissible for a Christian magistrate, although they are less favorable to the heretic, even though they cast all blame on the good and sincere Calvin. But why do I trouble you about a matter clear to you because of the impious opinion of some? Therefore, feel free to respond. For I do not doubt that it was both permissible and rightly done, since he persisted for so long and grew worse over the years by sowing the worst seed, which I wish had not grown in many, who, however, are beginning to fall silent. Farewell well and for a very long time, and know that I am yours through all ages. From Basel, November 16, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours truly, Guglielmo Grataroli. To the most illustrious and excellent minister of the Zürich church, Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed friend and superior in Zürich.</p>
