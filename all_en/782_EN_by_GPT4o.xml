      <p>Grace and peace from God, etc. I thank you for your response, also for the good wine.</p>
      <p>Further, I have not been well with J. Wilhelm, but he has shown favor. I can no longer get along with the world; I think I do what I can with eating and drinking, etc. Since I have started with him, I want to try properly with him for a while, no matter what it costs, because I do not dislike it. But the purging is too harsh, it seems to have no end, it goes on day and night now for eight days, it will be my death if I do not stop.</p>
      <p>If I had taken the fifth one first, I would be lying in the churchyard, I have not much else to do. God be with you all. Greet the family.</p>
      <p>Johannes, yours.</p>
      <p>The brother-in-law has written to Wilhelm about my condition, with the bowel movement last night I went 12 times, today I have taken partridge bones in a broth, stopped the red damage, do not know what it is, until the 9th day not fit, etc. Again, farewell from the sick bed of the body.</p>
