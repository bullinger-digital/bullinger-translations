      <p>God and all good things! Also, the emperor is recruiting many cavalrymen; what does it mean?</p>
      <p>Also, the French are said to have taken a fortification in Naisman in Bemont; it might give rise to misfortune. Also, the one from Büren was briefly in Bruchsel and soon died; he did not even half accomplish his plans. Also, in Saxony, many signs are said to have been seen in the sky.</p>
      <p>Also, I know of someone who has a son in the chancellery with the old Elector, that the good, pious prince is very steadfast and firm; he has also completely surrendered to the cross, so that he must always be thus imprisoned, may God wonderfully deliver him. His sons have also been advised to ask how they should conduct themselves regarding the Interim, as it is being seriously and strongly imposed on them. He has given them no other answer than: "I have given you an example, that you should do as I have done." He is otherwise still well treated and has free access to people, though guarded with Spaniards as in Augsburg. May the Lord God give him a steadfast hero's heart for all good, amen!</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, the government was recently changed, the small and large councils reduced, so that now there are 22 in the daily council, whereas there were 31 before; many of the old lords have been removed, such as the old mayor Wellenberg, Michel von Schwartzach, Onophorus Heuruß, and many others, while others have come in, Gorius Ungemüt, Nicodemus Guldinast, Claus Schmid, Burkhart Schlaich, Hans Frey, a cooper, etc. The old mayor Zündeler has been allowed to stay, and Hans Muntpraten has been made a city bailiff, and all matters are arranged so that major changes must also follow. All guilds have also been abolished, and their goods, which belonged to the common guilds, must answer to the town hall. The situation with the society at the Katzen is still the same; however, it is believed that the Katzen must also lose its hair, and its tail will be cut off to make it accessible. The colonel posted to Innsbruck last week, as they say, to the young prince.</p>
      <p>From Basel, as you well know, it is written that the bishop has sent the city the Interim by imperial command and urged them to accept it. What they answered, I do not know; it is not hidden from you.</p>
      <p>The Emperor is completely in, and it is written from a reliable source that he is in serious deliberation about a war, as is his custom, that he holds himself thus when he has a great matter to deliberate. It is also written that no one knows exactly whether it is against the Seestett or the Confederates.</p>
      <p>As they have now sworn again to confirm the government in Konstanz, the churches have been guarded with an upright banner, a sign of great mistrust. The articles have also been read in such a way that no one knows what he has sworn, and one of the small council says he does not know at all what he has sworn. Neither the mayor nor the new city clerk has a copy of the articles.</p>
      <p>The hospital in Konstanz still has its goods pledged in the king's land; also, the imperial ban against Konstanz has not yet been lifted in many places, and yet the commissioners say it is now only about resolving some articles. In summary: no one knows what a strange confused matter it is. The captain Eckle, who is also in Konstanz, is now being demanded by the imperial fiscal for 2000 florins, because he was Württembergian and against the emperor, likewise Herr Felchär von Knöringen for 8000 florins.</p>
      <p>It has been judged by their own judgment that the Interim must be accepted; many attempts were made with the bishop but in vain; they, along with other ministers, will give a response to the senate, etc.</p>
      <p>He intends to move, although he does not know where; he has six children, a decrepit mother-in-law with him, and a wife of not firm health. Calvin's writing on the Interim was enclosed with the letter; however, I could not read it yet; I fear the Emperor may take it as a reason to proceed against the Genevans.</p>
      <p>I send a copy of my letters to the Bernese, furthermore letters to our Haller and Musculus, which I found in a certain book while searching for something else these days. I wanted to include them in the letters sent to you recently; however, as the messenger had to be dispatched, I could not find them anywhere after a long search, because I had imprudently enclosed them in a book. Now, therefore, they will receive them, albeit late, but they will sense my duty in whatever way. Ah, pray for us, my friend and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>It seems like an age since nothing is returned from you in letters. Remind us in a timely manner if perhaps anything adverse to us exiles is being discussed at your next assembly. If you ever wish to write, send it to the innkeeper in Winterthur, whose sign is the Crown; for there Hieronymus Emporus, our pastor here, frequently travels.</p>
      <p>My brother, with my excellent sister and my wife, sends you and your household many greetings in the Lord, commending themselves most diligently to your pious prayers.</p>
      <p>Greetings to all brothers and friends, especially your ministers, in the Lord with our Gervasius and both Englishmen, Butler and Hooper.</p>
      <p>Farewell. February 14, 1549.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In Zurich.</p>
