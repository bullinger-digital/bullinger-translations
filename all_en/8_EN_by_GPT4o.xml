    <p xml:id="regest1">Before Bullinger now stands the announced young couple [Hans Rutishauser and his cousin Dorothea Diethelm known as MÃ¼nchin]. Blarer earnestly requests to assist the two and, among other things, to recommend them to the mayors Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab. Blarer will be grateful for this. He does not know the young couple well, but he has known their esteemed families for a long time. He can be trusted in this matter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">In the last weeks, Blarer entrusted a letter for Bullinger [not received] along with the reply letter from Emperor Charles V to the estates to a coachman from Konstanz [N.N.] for delivery. However, the coachman was not given a reply. Strange! Tomorrow, the coachman will set off again for Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Yesterday, Blarer gave a letter for Bullinger [not received] to a man from Strasbourg [N.N.], in which a letter for forwarding to Bern was enclosed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">There are currently no reliable news. Someone assured that the French King Henry II has taken Genoa. Blarer fears that, in any case, the situation is bad.</p>

      <p>Dearly beloved lord and brother, herewith you have the young couple, about whom I have previously written to you. It is my earnest brotherly request to you, for the sake of God and brotherly love, and also my own will, to make every effort to guide and support them, so that they may bring the matter to a good end. If it becomes necessary, I ask you to earnestly and diligently request my gracious dear lords, both the mayors Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab, to do their best in this matter. I ask this of you in all service and without reservation. It is indeed a respectable friendship on both sides and well known to me, although I do not know this young couple, but I have known their families for a long time. Therefore, I trust you will act as I do not doubt.</p>

      <p>By our coachman, I wrote to you last week with the enclosed reply from Emperor Charles V to the estates, etc. Please inform me whether you have received them. The coachman says he delivered all the letters. However, he was not given any reply, which has greatly surprised me. Tomorrow he will set off again for Zurich. May God truly protect you!</p>

      <p>Yesterday, I also wrote to you through a man from Strasbourg with a letter belonging to Bern.</p>

      <p>Praying to God very faithfully for us. There is nothing new at this time that has a solid basis. It is said that the French King Henry II has taken Genoa. Someone has certainly spread this as a costly truth. But I fear that, in any case, things have not gone well. Dated the 10th of January, 1548.</p>
      <p>A. Bl.</p>
      <p>To the Christian [Master] Heinrich Bullinger, [pastor in Zurich], my dearly beloved lord.</p>
