      <p>Pious, steadfast, honorable, prudent, and wise, gracious, dear lords.</p>
      <p>Since your honorable wisdom has been commanded by our lords (from the council) to inquire which pastors are in evident need and how they might be helped, here you have their names and all their circumstances. I earnestly request that your honorable wisdom kindly consider and regard not only their poverty and need but also the entire church's and the teaching's lack. For when one daily sees the contempt, poverty, and misery of the preachers, especially that they leave nothing behind after their death except that their wives and children must go into misery, no one is willing to educate their children for the teaching. This, however, is to be feared over time as a significant decline in teaching and teachers. Therefore, let this matter be entrusted to your honorable wisdom in faithfulness. The Lord Christ will recognize and accept it as if it were done to Him, what is done to His own. And may God keep you long in His grace.</p>
      <p>18th of May, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your honorable wisdom's humble servant of the word of God of the city of Zürich.</p>
