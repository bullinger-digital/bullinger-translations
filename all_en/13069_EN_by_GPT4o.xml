    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] First, some comments on Myconius' last letter [No. 3009 from September 10]. The Basel councilors have rightly shifted the burden [of any negotiations in favor of an alliance between Strasbourg, France, and the Swiss Confederates] onto the shoulders of King Henry II of France. For if one wanted to achieve something in this matter with the Nine Places, no one could do it better than Henry II. Myconius wants to know what to expect from the people of Zurich. He does not need to be told why they are reluctant to negotiate with France. Moreover, the people of Strasbourg have a very bad reputation. They preferred to listen to Wolfgang Rehlinger and trust him instead of God, even though they have such a well-fortified and wealthy city! They are said to favor many nobles who revere the Emperor like God, while the population is not united. No prudent person would ever trust the people of Strasbourg, especially since they have already rejected the help offered by France and acted questionably. However, if Henry II were to propose something to all the Swiss places in this regard, the people of Zurich will act as decent people would expect.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger would like to know more about Maximilian von Egmont, Count of Buren.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Enclosed is Haller's detailed letter [No. 3005] from September 9 about the situation in Augsburg. Myconius should return the letter with the next reliable messenger.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger could not write earlier. He found no messenger. He is also sending the present letter to Hartmann von Hallwyl [in Brugg] with the request for delivery.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] From a letter dated September 14 by a delegate [Hieronymus Pappus] from a Swabian city [Lindau] at the Imperial Diet in Augsburg, it emerges that the imperial cities and the princes are at odds with each other, while the Catholic clergy stands united. Emperor Charles V is terminally ill. King Ferdinand is also said to be seriously ill. A new uprising has occurred in Bohemia. Memmingen must pay 3000 and Kempten 2000 guilders to avoid the stationing of imperial garrisons.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Now to Myconius' earlier letter from the 23rd [August - No. 2997]. Bullinger no longer knows if he has replied to it. Besides, he wouldn't know what to answer in it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] He is still impatiently waiting for Johannes Murmellius' edition of Persius' Satires, which Johannes Gast is procuring for him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Today he received a letter from Chur [No. 3016 from September 20]. From it, one learns that the imperial troops led by Ferrante Gonzaga, Governor of Milan, have cunningly attacked and taken Parma and Piacenza, killed Duke Pier Luigi Farnese, and thrown his body out of his castle [in Piacenza]. This sodomite completely deserved it, just as the Five Cities [of the Dead Sea] were rightly destroyed by fire! The help [from Farnese's ally], Count Galeotto II Pico della Mirandola, arrived about two hours too late and had to return to Mirandola. Presumably, Gonzaga will now also attack the Count, and it is likely that there will be another battle between the Eagle [Emperor] and the Rooster [King of France]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Greetings, also to Gast, Francisco de Enzinas, and Celio Secondo Curione. In haste.</p>

      <p>S. D. First, I respond to your last letter. The Basel councilors have rightly shifted that burden from their shoulders onto the shoulders of King Henry II of France. For if anything can be achieved with the Swiss Confederates, no one could achieve it faster than the king. You ask what I hope for from our people. They are not willing to negotiate with the French. You know the reasons, so there is no need to recount them. Moreover, the people of Strasbourg have a very bad reputation among the best of us, because they possess the most fortified and wealthy city in Germany by God's grace, yet they have given more faith and ear to Rehlinger than to God. They are said to favor many nobles who worship the Emperor as a god. The populace is divided into many factions, so that the wisest and best do not trust those who first rejected the help of the French and acted quite dubiously. However, if the French king were to propose anything to all the Swiss places regarding this matter, there is no doubt about the people of Zurich. They will undoubtedly do what good men would require.</p>

      <p>I desire to know by all means what is true about Count Maximilian von Egmont of Buren.</p>

      <p>What Haller sent me from Augsburg is here described in detail (Haller's letter is dated September 9). However, you will return it in good faith and by the next reliable messenger.</p>

      <p>I could not write sooner. There were no messengers at hand. Indeed, I am sending this to Hartmann von Hallwyl to ensure it is delivered to you.</p>

      <p>On September 14, a letter was sent from Augsburg by a delegate of a Swabian city to the Imperial Diet, which among other things states: "Things are going badly here. The advice of the princes and the votes of the cities are in discord. The clergy are united. The Emperor is terminally ill. King Ferdinand is also said to be very ill. There is also talk of a new uprising in Bohemia. Memmingen pays 3000 guilders, Kempten 2000 guilders, just so that no soldiers are stationed there," etc.</p>

      <p>Regarding your earlier letter from the 23rd, I doubt whether I have replied, but I find nothing in it that requires a response.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I have not yet seen Persius with Murmellius' commentaries prepared by my Gastius; but I wish to see it!</p>

      <p>Today, that is September 23, I received a letter from Chur, which among other things contained: "A certain post from Italy has arrived here before the Emperor. It brings news that Pier Luigi Farnese was attacked and subdued in Parma and Piacenza by the imperial forces with wonderful cunning and treachery, stabbed to death, and thrown out of the castle" (the most vile sodomite deserved the fate of the Pentapolis). Ferdinand Gonzaga, the governor in Milan, holds both places. "Count of Mirandola arrived about two hours too late. He had to flee back to Mirandola." It is expected that the governor will visit him. It is expected that the Eagle and the Rooster will clash again, etc.</p>

      <p>Farewell, my most esteemed Myconius. In Zurich, in great haste. Greet Gastius, Dryander, Coelius, etc., diligently. September 23, 1547. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, minister of the church in Basel, esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Basel.</p>
