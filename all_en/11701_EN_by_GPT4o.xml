    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommends a religious refugee who preached the evangelical faith in Orléans and was imprisoned for it, as indicated by a letter from the Nuremberg pastors; Musculus and Frecht have also written on his behalf; Bullinger should try to find him a position in the Bernese territory. Schuler's wife and children are healthy, except for his son Gervasius. The campaign against the Turks is not progressing, which is not surprising; God wants us to repent first. The French [King Francis I] has devastated Luxembourg; the Swiss are accused of fueling the war [through mercenary service], which cannot be said of Zurich, Bern, and Basel. [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse, together with Elector [John Frederick] of Saxony and Duke [Ernst] of Lüneburg, defeated Duke Henry of Brunswick within 10 days - Schuler includes a list of the conquered castles and towns -; whether the [Schmalkaldic] troops will be dismissed after the peace promise from Emperor Charles and [King] Ferdinand is still open. The outcome of the city assembly in Ulm is not yet known; the estates in the empire are divided, the cities - except Überlingen - have refused Ferdinand the new tax [at the Nuremberg Imperial Diet], and the princes have deprived the cities of the right to sessions. Inquiry about and greetings to Leo Jud. Greetings from [Balthasar] Funk.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, beloved brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter came to me, a Frenchman by nationality, originating from the royal city of Orléans in France, where he preached Christ for two years and was eventually exiled from the city by the grace of God after imprisonment, as testified by the letters of the Nuremberg brothers. Musculus from Augsburg and Frecht, the minister of the church in Ulm, also wrote to me about this matter. Therefore, receive him as an exile and wanderer for Christ in the Lord, and help him, dear Bullinger, with your piety, so that he may be provided for in the Bernese territory and not be forced to wander so much after long imprisonments.</p>
      <p>As for my affairs, know that everything is well. My wife and children are all healthy except for my eldest son Gervasius, who, as I write this, is very ill, yet I hope he will recover with God's help through the hand of the doctor.</p>
      <p>I have nothing to write about the war against the Turks. Our army lies in a strange manner, silent and sluggish, and it is no wonder; for it is hard, indeed impossible, to avert God's wrath, which we have incurred in many ways, with our efforts before we have repented of our sins, by which we have stirred up God's fury against us. I truly fear we will achieve nothing.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the pseudo-Christian Frenchman has occupied and devastated almost the entire Luxembourg region of Lower Germany with war and fire. What will become of our Germany, the Lord knows. Your Swiss are spoken of very poorly among all pious and good men as those who provide no small fuel to such great wars. It may not be permissible to predict such dire things about the people of Zurich, Bern, and Basel.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, the Prince of Hesse, together with the Elector of Saxony and the Duke of Lüneburg, successfully defeated Duke Henry of Brunswick within ten days. Here you have the number of castles and towns listed in order. With the army gathered, he is still waiting for a lasting peace from the papists; he has obtained it from Emperor Charles and Ferdinand, but not yet from the others. Whether he will dismiss the army after obtaining peace from the Emperor and Ferdinand is unknown; it is risky to trust those among whom everything is full of deceit. The Protestant assembly is now being held in Ulm; I do not yet know what has been decided. In summary: There is no unity in the empire; the princes, prelates, nobility, and cities are not loyal to each other. The king has requested another tax from the cities, but it has been unanimously rejected by all cities except Überlingen. Everyone in the empire does as they please, everything is conducted by force, contrary to right and justice. The imperial cities have been deprived of their session at the imperial diets by the work and unjust industry of the princes. The deceit of merchants has almost swallowed up the king and all the nobles of Germany; everything has been relegated to the last line of defense. Let us pray to the Lord diligently, that either an end may be put to such great calamities immediately or that everything may turn to the glory of the Lord.</p>
      <p>I have not yet heard anything about Lord Leo Jud, my old friend and brother; I eagerly wish to hear about his well-being in body and soul. Greet him in my name and wish him all happiness in my name, as well as his whole family. Consul Funckius sends you many greetings through me.</p>
      <p>Farewell, excellent brother, together with your most faithful wife and children. Given in Memmingen, September 8, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the church in Zurich, much respected brother in Christ.</p>
