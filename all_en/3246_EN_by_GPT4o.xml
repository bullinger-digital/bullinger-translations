      <p>Grace and peace of God, our heavenly Father, be with you through Christ Jesus, the only redeemer of the faithful. Amen.</p>
      <p>The opinion I had formed, which was not good, about my sons, reverend and beloved brother in Jesus Christ, Bullinger, has now been completely removed from my mind, for I have the utmost faith in the writings of your lordships, and your letters have been of great consolation to me. From them, I have learned that our heavenly Lord, through His means, has brought a good end to these disturbances (so to speak) between the reverend Lord Wolfgang, the host of my sons, and Johann Thenaud, their former teacher. Therefore, thanks and eternal praise be to God. I rejoice in the Lord because He has freed me from this care and fear concerning my boys and has appointed in my place such distinguished men who take on the burden of instructing and educating my sons. I pray that He may complete what He has begun and lead it to a good end. Furthermore, I am very grateful for the mutual prayer of your church, redeemed by the blood of Christ, which you do not forget to make for me and for other faithful members of Christ.</p>
      <p>Then, no less delightful is your singular exhortation, in which you encourage me to always continue in piety, faith, love, and all good Christian works. May the Lord increase His blessings upon you here and in the future heavenly and eternal life. Finally, I sincerely wish you well for the praise of the Lord and the glory and consolation of His church.</p>
      <p>Given at Iwanowicze, July 19, in the year of our Lord 1557. Yours most devoted, Agnes Dluska of Mirow.</p>
      <p>To the most adorned with piety, learning, and various gifts of God, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful minister of the word of God, brother united to me through Christ, sincerely beloved.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
