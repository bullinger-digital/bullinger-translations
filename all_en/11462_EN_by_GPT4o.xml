    <p xml:id="regest1">Opponents of the Gospel claim that Philip of Hesse married a second wife with the consent of his theologians; he cannot believe that they would approve of such a thing, and sees no reason why the prince, whom he esteems, should do this. It would be disgraceful if they were to remain silent about such an act, contrary to the teachings of Christ and the Apostle Paul, thereby giving the opponents the right to accuse the Protestants of carnal motives. He urges him to dissuade the prince if he is indeed so out of his mind. Requests a response.</p>

      <p>To Lord Dionysius Melander, preacher to the most illustrious Prince of the Cattians, most esteemed brother.</p>
      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>I always write letters, most learned Dionysius, filled with complaints and lamentations. But such is the command of that love which is concerned for the welfare of the beloved. Some enemies of the evangelical truth have spread among us a rather disastrous rumor about the Prince of Hesse and some of his theologians, that he has taken another wife, Martha von der Saale, and that some of his theologians defend the act as not at all illicit. However, I hope for much better, since I hold the prince's upright character in such regard and am so confident in his faith that I assert it does not seem probable to me that such a new and unchristian thing would be attempted by anyone who has even lightly tasted the evangelical faith, let alone by you.</p>
      <p>The prince has no reasons to take a second wife. For the first princess is an excellent and most pious woman, of full age and beauty, fruitful and distinguished by all conjugal virtues. And if he thought he had any reasons, yet Christ should be heard rather than his affections.</p>
      <p>Christ's saying, repeated from Moses in Matthew 19:5, is great and evident: "The two shall become one flesh." No one is unaware, except those who do not consider what he said in 1 Corinthians 7 and Ephesians 5, that polygamy was displeasing to the most renowned Apostle of Christ, Paul.</p>
      <p>As for the actions of Abraham, Jacob, David, and Solomon, I think no Christian will twist them to satisfy their own lust. Why then are the examples of Adam, Lamech, Noah, Isaac, Joseph, Moses, and others not brought forward? We know what Christ taught and what the apostolic doctrine is. And even if we concede that something is permissible and allowed here, it would have been much more fitting to observe that of Paul: "All things are lawful for me, but not all things are helpful" [1 Corinthians 6:12; 10:23]. The Lord cries out: "Woe to him through whom the offense comes" [Matthew 18:7; Luke 17:1]. Not without reason do the enemies cry out that we seek nothing else in the Gospel but lust and flesh. Allow me, my brother, to speak more freely. You will have branded yourself and the prince with an eternal and indelible stain if you remain silent about such a scandal and consent to it; for I hear that you are his Nathan and Samuel.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I would write to the prince himself if I could bring myself to believe that he is attempting such a thing, so much do I love the excellent prince. At present, however, I remind you of your duty, to be a man and faithful, if he should wish to attempt such a thing through weakness. You will place your life in your hands and do what all good men will praise you for forever, and for which you will be of great esteem with the prince, who will also thank you when he has slept off his madness; for you will appeal from the mad to the sane as he did from the drunken Alexander to the sober. For love makes men mad. But you have been given to the prince as a guardian and healer of diseases.</p>
      <p>Farewell and write what I should believe. For I have not yet been able to believe that you are all so insane. May the Lord Jesus keep you all in His will.</p>
      <p>Zurich, the last day of August, 1540.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
