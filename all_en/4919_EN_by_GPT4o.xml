      <p>Greetings. Enclosed letters have been brought from elsewhere and entrusted to me; I now send them to you, dearest brother. Matters in France are progressing.</p>
      <p>Bishops and prelates have gathered; the evangelical preachers of Paris and the King of Navarre have begun to skirmish with them, seeking assistance from our people. Today, the most honorable council is deliberating on what needs to be done; there are many uncertainties and more difficulties than we would like. Therefore, we must pray to the Lord to inspire us with His will and grant us grace; with Him as our advisor and leader, all will be well. I can say nothing more now.</p>
      <p>Letters from France from the court were delivered by post to Saint-Germain on August 12.</p>
      <p>This is for you alone; I do not wish for you to share it with others. Pray to the Lord for us.</p>
      <p>Farewell. August 22, 1561.</p>
      <p>Mr. Beza has already set out for France, and I believe he is already at the court, if the journey was safe; he was escorted by a certain captain by post. Cardinal Ferrara is expected in France with 300 horses, the Pope's legate; he intends to disrupt everything. May the Lord crush this Satan!</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, his most esteemed and beloved friend and brother.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Ambrosius Blarer in Winterthur.</p>
