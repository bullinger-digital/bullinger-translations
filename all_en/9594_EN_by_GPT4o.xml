      <p>S. Reverend and most esteemed lord whom I hold in the highest regard: I received your letter, dated the last day of July of the previous year, in October. However, the more they delighted me, having been eagerly awaited for a long time, the more they grieved me because I understood from them that disputes are being revived among you by certain turbulent men, indeed younger ones, who are trying to erase the entire face of the church, which was established not without great efforts by the best men, and to introduce a new one composed according to their own pleasure. Everywhere in the world, there are such troublesome men, who, when they cannot bring into effect what they intend, meanwhile disturb and vex many good people with their efforts, offend the simpler ones, raise the hopes of the papists, and greatly hinder the course of the gospel.</p>
      <p>The Reverend Lord of Ely complained about this very matter last year, both to our Gwalther and to me, the Reverend Lord of London. Therefore, he responded to some of his questions, and I have now responded to a few things proposed by him. We are also troubled throughout Germany by such minds. Nor do I see a more salutary counsel in this matter than if we turn to the Lord and diligently pray that He may restrain such turbulent and innovation-prone minds with His grace and preserve the churches in peace: then, that they may be brought back to the way through friendly conferences or colloquies; but those who are obstinate and insolent and cannot be brought back, may be depicted in their true colors, so that they may have less authority among the wise, and thus do less harm. But there is no need for me to instruct you in this matter, since from long experience and the successful governance of the churches so far, you have long since learned what should be done or omitted here.</p>
      <p>There are those in Germany who boast of being Lutherans, but in truth, they are the most shameless brawlers, revilers, and slanderers. They do not cease to attack our churches, us, and our doctrine of the Lord's Supper, which they grievously burden with the hateful name of Zwinglian. And now they have newly published books against us and the people of Heidelberg, which, if we had ignored them, we might have seemed to the pious to be traitors to sound doctrine and our holy churches. Therefore, we have divided the labor or trouble of responding, my beloved son-in-law Josias Simler, a professor of theology in our school, and I; so that he might respond in Latin and somewhat more copiously to the arguments of the adversaries, and I in German, briefly and popularly for the understanding of the common people. I send copies of both books and ask that you kindly accept them from me, your most loving friend, and read them when you have the opportunity. You know that Brentius, with his ardor and zeal for victory and disputation (with whom, while he lived, I had many and long disputes, as the published booklets testify), has mixed many articles of faith into the matter of the Supper, about which his disciples now dispute, and they do not cease to obscure and call into question many things: such as, about the one person and two natures of Christ, about the omnipotence and omnipresence (as they say) of the humanity of Christ, about the ascension to heaven and heaven, etc. Therefore, we have been compelled to respond to these points. But it will be for you and other pious men to judge these our responses. I pray the Lord that we have discussed these things with much fruit for the church.</p>
      <p>We have responded primarily to matters, not to persons, refraining from insults, lest we become like them.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, in our churches, everything is peaceful by the grace of God. The adversaries see that the better part of the people everywhere join our (which is Christ's) doctrine and church; therefore, they rage, etc. May the Lord restrain them! However, we are incessantly vexed by the associates and neighbors adhering to the pope, at the instigation of the pontiff, who is greatly grieved that the doctrine of Christ is preached in the vicinity of Italy, and that it spreads more than he wishes. Therefore, he strives to set us against each other in war. May the Lord keep us from evil!</p>
      <p>Those who come from Italy say that the Venetians are uncertain about the peace made with the Turkish prince, and therefore have sent a fleet to Crete, and are newly arming ships and enlisting soldiers. Meanwhile, they have an ambassador with the Turk, who recently announced that he does not entirely despair; but it would benefit the Venetian republic if they nevertheless take care of their affairs, lest they be overwhelmed unprepared if the hope of peace dissipates. Moreover, it is certain that no Turkish prince has ever been more equipped by land and sea than this Selim, and it is certain that this spring he will bring all his forces into Spain and its allies. Therefore, the Maltese are hastily gathering from all over Germany to Malta. Thus they are preparing in Apulia, Calabria, and Sicily, etc. What will happen, the Lord knows, whom I sincerely pray to have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>But also in Germany, under Mainz and above Cologne, a cavalry and infantry army is being enlisted, which is said to be led by Dukes Christopher of the Palatinate and Louis of Nassau into Lorraine, others think into Belgium, some say into France. However, this is still uncertain.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Anjou passed through Germany into Poland. On the journey, everywhere he was reproached for the murder of Admiral Coligny and the faithful. He was received magnificently by the Poles. Besides this, we have nothing on this matter. And now the rumor is growing that the King of France will request two legions from his allied Swiss. However, I will affirm nothing certain here.</p>
      <p>I ask your excellency to kindly share this, if it pleases you, with Mr. Pilkington of Durham, and to excuse me for not writing individual letters to him privately. I wish him well and to be in good health in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Indeed, unless I knew there was a close connection between you, however much I am overwhelmed with many affairs, I would have sent him some letters. He also has attached here an example of the response of Mr. Josias Simler on presence, etc. For I ordered our Froschauer to send you two copies, so that you may give one to the Bishop of Durham. I sent you only the German copy, none to the Bishop of Durham, because I know he cannot read German writings.</p>
      <p>At the end of your letter, you mention sending a token of remembrance. I truly ask that you do not incur any expenses on my account. What I have contributed to you so far and continue to contribute, I do so willingly, not for any gifts. Meanwhile, the tokens of remembrance from brothers and friends are not unwelcome, as testimonies of mutual friendship, just as I have so far deposited our labors with you, as a testimony that I am entirely yours, and in all things in which I can serve and gratify you, and that I sincerely love you. It is enough for me to have your mutual friendship, and if you write occasionally, as you are accustomed. I also know that friends strive to send gifts to each other, and such can be received by good people: but I have seen the letters of your innovators, in which they indicate that they send gifts to the learned bishops of England, to win them over to their side. These, for their virulence, could defame both us and our ministry.</p>
      <p>Therefore, with the apostle, I say, All things are lawful for me, but not all things are beneficial. He could have received a stipend, but he did not, because of the adversaries. Nevertheless, I give you the greatest thanks I can for that kindness. But also for the poem sent to me, about Scotland being liberated from civil war by the most serene Queen of England, I give thanks to your kindness. It was very pleasing. I pray the Lord to strengthen and preserve the queen.</p>
      <p>May He also bless you and all yours, and keep you from evil. Zurich, March 10, in the year of our Lord 1574.</p>
      <p>I commend our Julius to you.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your reverence, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Lord Edmund Grindal, Archbishop of York.</p>
