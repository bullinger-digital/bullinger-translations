      <p>Although I have nothing of great importance to write to you about at the moment, my dearest and much-esteemed Bullinger, since even the memory of you is most delightful to me, and your most loving letters, in which you so often testify that you remember us, are even more delightful, I did not want to let our fellow citizen, who is traveling there, come to you without my letters, so that I may receive a word or two from you in return, which will pleasantly refresh me when he returns; although I have nothing to cheer you with, I have much that causes us mutual sorrow of the soul. The now escalating unfortunate war between the Genevans and the Bernese torments me beyond measure, especially since I hear no one here who intervenes with the necessary concern, zeal, and diligence. Many anxiously fear that the fate that befell MÃ¼nster in previous years may also befall the Republic of Geneva, as soon as our Calvin is taken from them by death or some other event. For as long as he is alive and present, the monstrous intemperance of some can be restrained, but once he is gone, they will soon erupt and unleash the monster they have long nurtured in one fell swoop, so we must constantly pray to our Prince of Peace, Christ, to take care and patronage of that church. Please do not hide from me what you foresee in this matter, and whether it is true, as is now being rumored here, that the invention of Conrad Zwick and his associates, which is most useful to almost all mortals for the convenient conservation of wood, has already been successfully initiated by your people, and that the people of Strasbourg are also attempting it. The expectation of many regarding this gift from the Lord is great and no less impatient. May the Lord himself mature everything with his own hand.</p>
      <p>The mayor Hans Welser of Augsburg writes that the Turkish campaign has been approved by the Empire at Regensburg; however, the Protestant estates have given the envoy of Passau a dismissal in return, which he promised them, against which the Roman king, along with the pope and their followers, are earnestly opposed. What will come of it, we will soon hear. He also writes about the large number of cavalry and infantry that the French are sending over the mountains to the pope against the King of England, of which you will have better knowledge yourselves.</p>
      <p>He also mentions that Margrave Albrecht died on January 9th, from which he hopes that peace may remain in these lands sooner, unless the Protestant princes intend to undertake something against the Duke of Bavaria, since he is entirely against God's word and yet his subjects would very much like to have it.</p>
      <p>He writes that in a few weeks many intrigues will become apparent. May dear God turn everything to good, lasting peace.</p>
      <p>My dear cousin in Rheinfelden writes to me about how everything is very difficult for your brother-in-law, the pious old city clerk Adelschwyler; she thinks you should help him with a position, as he has nothing to gain. She has nothing more to do, as she has handed over all authority to her relatives and receives an annual payment for it. She gives him a small service fee, more out of friendship and love than because he needs it. Therefore, if it is possible for you, do your best so that the good, pious man can also have his sustenance. Your lordship's territory is wide and broad; there should be some office or position where he could be useful, etc.</p>
      <p>Given on the 8th day of February 1557.</p>
      <p>Greet all the brothers and friends as lovingly and respectfully as you can. I commend myself to your and their pious intercessions before the Lord. Funck greets you.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his incomparable brother and friend. Zurich.</p>
