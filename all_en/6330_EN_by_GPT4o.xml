      <p>Greetings. Your letter, reverend father in Christ, reached me somewhat more untimely than during the summer days; therefore, if my writing is hasty, you will forgive me; for in such a short time, I must either write very quickly or not respond at all; so, accept this brief reply. Your letters were, as always, most welcome to me, but now even more so, because I perceived from them some vigor of your spirit and more abundance than from previous ones. May the Father of mercy fully restore you to us soon, as I hope; our ingratitude threatens us with a great desolation of church teachers; what will happen in the end, only the Lord knows.</p>
      <p>If the good and pious old man Ambrosius Blaurer has also exchanged this troubled life for the heavenly one, we have reason to congratulate him; the church is certainly deprived of an extraordinary light.</p>
      <p>The departure of pious people does not frighten me as much as the obstinacy and misconduct of some servants. The one about whom I once wrote, that he was about to ruin himself, whom the legate painted for you in his colors, has now revealed himself.</p>
      <p>The maid, whom he expelled from the house a few months ago, pregnant and near childbirth, calls him the father.</p>
      <p>The matter is evident to everyone; there is no doubt. Citizens, women, all come to me, indignantly shouting about the deed; the papists triumph over a minister more than sixty years old. I do not know where this matter will erupt.</p>
      <p>Some things about this with the consul and others.</p>
      <p>It would be an epic if I pursued everything.</p>
      <p>He sent her away, but it became known through a gossip that he had been with the whore. He did not want the child; she went around the whole city, once accused him before the mayor and demanded justice. I do not know what advice to give or take (for I do not concern myself with the rabble); he gave her some guilders and sent her away to childbirth. Now you think about the position I am in.</p>
      <p>Although these things are very evident, the magistrate, who knows everything, still murmurs; they would like me to handle it. If I do, they say it is out of envy, and if he has many small children, they say I am the author of driving them into misery. The man is otherwise very frivolous; nothing shames him.</p>
      <p>If I remain silent and preach alongside him, few will say it is one like the other, helping him to cover it up. No one wants to anger the other in this and other matters; it is a misery. - The other, Heinrich Ganter, about whom you once, who met you in Zurich, has now come from Rapperswil, has received the first weeks, would have gladly become a priest; now recalled by his mother, a very pious and honest matron, he aspires again to the ministry, a very bad and inconsistent man.</p>
      <p>Others deal with him more indulgently; I alone am forced to oppose him. All burdens lie on me; no one wants to bite and anger the other.</p>
      <p>Dr. Tscharner, however, helps me quite wisely. I should not have troubled you with these things; but I lay the miserable state still in your bosom; everything is dislocated and corrupted.</p>
      <p>Regarding the one whose letters I sent to you in the Glarus case, which displeased you, know that he is a very learned man, but cannot bear it if anyone disagrees; I, however, do not care, and openly, whenever he calls me to a conversation, I state my opinion. I was glad to hear what you said about the Bernese; but I assure you for certain that the French will not accept any conditions that the Five Cantons do not approve.</p>
      <p>The Five Cantons are very dear to them and yet take from them honestly. But they act as if there are no other fighting men in the Confederation, etc.</p>
      <p>Cursed is he who trusts in princes; the longer I experience it, the more I see it. In these lands, it also happens: those who advise them faithfully and in vain are not worth as much to them as those who speak to please them and thus deceive them, so that they need to take the skin over their ears.</p>
      <p>So it must go and belongs to them.</p>
      <p>As far as the Glarus people are concerned, their council pleases very few sensible people among us, except those who know how things stand in Glarus and how the French are minded. They have been advised faithfully not to act until they have reconciled with the Swiss.</p>
      <p>Gregorius Carli himself, who is very French, advised them this. It would have been much more commendable for them to have made a sea, for all the lords to go idle.</p>
      <p>The French could have endured it better. This is a selfish counsel, and if they insist on it, the French will light a new fire against the Glarus people with the Five Cantons, whom they have previously separated, just to make the Glarus people hated, so that their example does not also come to the other Cantons.</p>
      <p>For the king cannot let the private pensions go; if he does not give, then Philip gives; so it stands, unfortunately. With this, the king would have to give both privately and publicly.</p>
      <p>In Glarus, the Tschudis and others would not want their pension any less, God grant, what they have increased. There are other papists who have so far kept with ours; they will turn around.</p>
      <p>There are among ours the foremost, BÃ¤ldius, Vogelius, and others, the highest pensioners. It will give much unrest; therefore, I do not know if this time some changes can be endured in their divided government. I have faithfully reminded Mr. Fridolin and Balthasar Heren that they should not undertake more than they can well maintain, so that the last does not become worse than the first. I hear wonderful plans of the pensioners; strange practices.</p>
      <p>In the previous union, they also went idle, for all the lords to go idle, but they did not remain there. What can you do where there is such inconstancy? These things in passing. - In the royal cause, nothing has been done here in the meantime.</p>
      <p>I recently sent a writing about the action (presentation) of the Spaniards.</p>
      <p>- Most of those who remained from the Hannibalic soldiers die on the way; here in Chur, several have been buried; scarcely the thirtieth survives. - Give my writing about the plague to Collinus, my father-in-law, to put in the barrel, which he is soon to send to me. Farewell, reverend father in Christ, with all your family, most happily and for a long time.</p>
      <p>Give my most respectful and many greetings to Mr. Lavater, your son-in-law.</p>
      <p>Chur, December 11, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and most reverend father in Christ. Zurich to Mr. Bullinger.</p>
