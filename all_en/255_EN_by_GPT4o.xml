      <p> S. I am still in Griesenberg, where I received letters from our Haller in Constance, which were brought here late last night, along with other letters to which I must respond. Therefore, I cannot write much to you now, my venerable Bullinger. I am anxiously awaiting your letters, very eager to know whether that Swiss courier has returned and what response he brought from the Emperor. </p>
      <p> What is happening with your people at the diet now? Here, I have been so greatly troubled by [Greek] that it has almost completely exhausted me. Pray for us and our city, that if it is possible by any means, all these evils may be recalled by His goodness, and that He may restore us to our former and even better state of Christianity and preserve us in it perpetually. Farewell with all your family. My excellent sister greets you very respectfully. </p>
      <p> Griesenberg, 6th of September, 1548. </p>
      <p> Yours, A[mbrosius] B[larer]. </p>
      <p> The letters you see here, please ensure they are delivered carefully to Marcellus Theodorich at the first opportunity, I ask you greatly. </p>
      <p> To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich. </p>
