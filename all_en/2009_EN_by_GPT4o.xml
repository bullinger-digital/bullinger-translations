      <p>That I am responding later to your letters sent to me on the first of August, do not attribute to my laziness or negligence; for I hold you in high regard and receive your letters with joy. But since there was nothing that required an immediate response, I have delayed until now, as my private and public affairs allow me to write to my distinguished friend. You have done excellently, brother and honorable lord, in abolishing the mass; for I am certain that no greater abomination has come into the world before the Lord.</p>
      <p>For at the beginning, bread or an empty figure is worshipped as God, adorned with gold and silver, as Daniel predicted in chapter 2. Again, it is offered for the sins of the living and the dead, when it cannot be offered again after being offered once, except with great insult to the death of Christ; it is offered by those who are more defiled by fornication, drunkenness, and gluttony, and all impurity than almost dogs. The mass is a direct perversion of the holy institution of Christ in the supper; in it, foreign gods are supplicated, dead men are invoked, idols are worshipped: in short, the mass is a compendium of all impiety. Therefore, you have done well, indeed excellently, in abolishing it; you will do better if you are also the author, so that others may reject what was rightly instituted in the gospel, so that it may not be received anywhere once it has been rejected. - I hear that the apostolic nuncio is preparing in Como to enter Rhaetia with safe conduct accepted by you and to convert those turned away from the apostolic see. These men do not act with the scriptures, they do not desire souls and bodies to be saved; but they pursue their own affairs, they wish to stir up dissensions among you. Therefore, be vigilant and be faithful and strong men; the salvation of souls and bodies is at stake. I send you sermons I have given on the Lord's Supper, as well as the English articles with the catechism.</p>
      <p>You will see here that not only we teach this here, but that the doctrine resounds far away in the very islands of the sea; for both kingdoms are now disturbed because of the king's death. However, the truth is always invincible. Live and farewell and keep me recommended to you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 15th of September, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Travers, of Zuoz in Rhaetia, his most esteemed and dear lord and singular friend.</p>
      <p>Zuoz.</p>
