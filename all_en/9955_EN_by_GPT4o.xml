      <p>S. How my private affairs are going, I believe you have learned from what I have already written before, and you will learn more from what I write to my brother. What I have done, I was forced to do, nor could I have done otherwise without compromising my honor; in this matter, I also followed not only private but also the advice of friends. However, the Lord has arranged things excellently, so that it has been beneficial for me, for others, and, most importantly, for the church itself, about which I now have better hopes than before. I am sending back the letters of Thretius along with the judgments of Mr. Gwalther and Simler about Hasler, and I thank you and them; if Mr. Erastus has responded, I ask that I may also know it. As for French affairs, we have nothing yet, except what I suppose you also have; for the royal orator writes to Salodorum that on the sixth of May our people were finally heard by the king, and on the ninth of that month, a meeting was held at the house of Belliureus, where there was a discussion for four or five whole hours, with our envoys and those of Prince Condé also present. However, he does not write what was decided, except that he adds that the envoys of the prince and other provinces, the Huguenots, were dismissed with certain conditions of peace, which they are to bring to their people, and he believes that your envoys are also on their way back. Thus, they are expected here very soon. Meanwhile, in these days, a large delegation has been sent from here to Valais to renew the treaty with them. I assume you have already seen Calvin's work on letters. Merlin and Gracilis, along with the entire court of the Coligny family, greet you, as do our compatriots, especially Steiger, Diesbach, Zerkintes, Manuel, etc. Gravenriet has set out for the Valais. Above all, my son-in-law Blasius Marcuard greets you warmly, who has been here with me for 15 days now and thanks you for interceding so kindly for him with Steiger and Diesbach.</p>
      <p>He would be transferred here, if not for the burden of the entire school of Lausanne almost resting upon him; but the Lord will free him someday, and our lords also recognize his labors and are very generous towards him. Today we have our synod, which, although I cannot attend due to foot ailments, I still have some other occupations, so I cannot write more now.</p>
      <p>Farewell, therefore, and may the Lord always keep you safe! Greet the friends and brothers, especially those of your household. I thank Mr. Simler for his Aethicus, to whom I will also write, if I can; such journeys are now very convenient for us.</p>
      <p>Bern, May 25, 1575.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, all yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the elder, most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, my esteemed lord and compatriot, with the highest respect always to be honored.</p>
