    <p xml:id="regest1">Awaits the return of a messenger sent to Ambrosius Blarer. The Emperor is said to be planning a naval expedition against the Turks. Desire for the unity of the Church. Greetings. Thanks for Bullinger's "Assertio utriusque in Christo naturae" against the "Arians" and for the preservation of church unity. Ludwig HÃ¤tzer was punished in Konstanz for his godlessness. In his translation of the prophets, he did not attribute the name of God to Christ. Zwick requests the return of his letter No. 435.</p>

      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>I have nothing to report that would be of interest to you. However, a messenger has been sent to Ambrosius Blarer, whom I expect at any moment. If he brings anything worth knowing, you will not remain unaware.</p>
      <p>We have no news about the Emperor's arrival. However, there are those who say that a naval armament is being prepared against the Turks.</p>
      <p>For us, who are engaged in the business of Christ, it is anxiously to be observed that certain insolent affections do not separate our minds, from which dissension in the church may arise, and then, that we do not cease to earnestly cry out to God, lest He abandon us and the flock of our faith entrusted to us in His mercy. Amen.</p>
      <p>I wish Pellican, Leo, and Stainer, along with the other excellent brothers, to be well.</p>
      <p>I thank you for the booklet you recently sent, concerning both natures of Christ. It is worthwhile to exert all efforts, so that the Arians do not emerge, not only because of the error of that article but also so that the holy unity of the church does not perish in new and lamentable discord. But did not that Hetzer play the role of a notable falsifier, who paid the penalty for his impiety among us? For in translating the prophets, he did not attribute the name of God to Christ in either Isaiah or Jeremiah. Such was the nature of that man.</p>
      <p>Return my letter sometime. I do not have a copy and would not want it to fall into anyone's hands.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man, and do not cease to embrace me with the love with which you have begun.</p>
      <p>Konstanz, 22nd October 1534.</p>
      <p>Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, esteemed brother.</p>
