      <p>Greetings and Peace. I have received your letter, venerable father and teacher in Christ, in which you indicate that you dedicated a booklet to my most illustrious prince, Lord Wilhelm, Landgrave of Hesse, last year. I have heard nothing about this matter, except for what Dr. Hyperius told me a few days ago. Therefore, I am completely unaware of how it was received, or even if it was faithfully delivered; for neither time nor opportunity has allowed me to ascertain this from the most illustrious prince, as the time was too short. But an opportunity will arise, indeed I will seek it, so that I may know everything from that time; then, whatever I learn, I will immediately inform you, God willing.</p>
      <p>When your son comes here (whom I have long known by face), I will ensure (if I can conveniently, I promise all my efforts) that he is called by the prince and given some small gift for the book dedicated to the prince, and whatever I can do here for his favor, I will do wholeheartedly.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I give thanks to the Lord God Almighty, who has never forgotten me in such great distress. I have obtained here a sufficiently honorable position with my most illustrious prince, which I have used and will use for a time, until it pleases the Lord to call me elsewhere to my first function, which would be most pleasing to me. Twice now, since I came here, I have been called by the churches to ecclesiastical duty. But my most illustrious prince has never wanted to release me, which forces me to act as a courtier, although court life is not entirely pleasing to me. For the court, however Christian it may be, is nothing other than what the world itself is. Therefore, let him who wishes to be pious avoid the court. There the flesh is fattened, but the strength of the soul is greatly weakened. But I have committed the whole matter to the Lord God. Regarding my departure from Strasbourg, and what was the cause of my dismissal, I write nothing; I prefer that you understand all this from my teacher, Lord Dr. Peter Martyr, rather than from me. The Lord will also grant that I may someday narrate this in person. Indeed, if I ascend to Geneva, I will visit you in passing, if the Lord permits; for I have long been held by a great desire to see you and your church, so that I may draw some consolation and edification from there.</p>
      <p>May God grant that it be as soon as possible, provided it serves His glory. Meanwhile, farewell forever happily. May the Lord God keep you safe for a long time for the glory of His name and the edification of His church, amen.</p>
      <p>Marburg, this 20th of April, 1557.</p>
      <p>I wish to send greetings especially to my father and teacher, Dr. Peter Martyr, then to Dr. Gualther and the other pious brothers in Christ our Lord and Savior.</p>
      <p>You will learn the rest from Dr. Hyperius and the bearer of this letter. Excuse the style and pen; for I am now called, so that I can scarcely read it over.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted, Jean Garnier.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and distinguished doctor of the Christian church, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his teacher and superior in the Lord. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
