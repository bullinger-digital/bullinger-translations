      <p>For the master is quite faint-hearted in this matter.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the lords of Ensisheim, coming here on the 18th of September in the name of the Emperor, ordered that all Anabaptists be expelled from the valley, as they call it, of Albert, which has been done.</p>
      <p>Then, they demanded that I, the worst of all heretics, a Zwinglian and also a Calvinist, be expelled from the town, and finally, that he should not deviate even a finger's breadth from the religion of the ancestors and the so-called Catholic Church. You see, dear Bullinger, or rather you understand, into what situation my affairs have fallen and in what kind of danger I am: either I must emigrate or bring danger to the baron with my presence. He promises defense, but he can hardly do so.</p>
      <p>He has noble advisors, a chancellor, and other lords who are not very devoted to piety, who, being inconsistent, fear that the sky will fall. If I must absolutely emigrate, I will go to Mulhouse, etc.</p>
      <p>Lord Nicholas is still quite ill in Hunawihr, where our Götzius also still remains. They are safer there than I am.</p>
      <p>Here I am alone, and it is almost a matter of my life, nor do my Württemberg enemies cease to seek an opportunity to deprive me of the generosity of the protecting princes, which had provided for my old age. But I am prepared, not troubled, a naked man of exile, I will go under the earth naked.</p>
      <p>And to establish their own, they falsely forge the tale of this dissipation against me, and finally, in my absence, the republic is much more cruelly tumultuous.</p>
      <p>Recently they celebrated the supper, but out of such a large gathering, only eight, who are, however, lords, participated. The matter has now been referred to the guardians by the Swabian preacher; they think that those who are senators and of the highest order, since they have not participated for two years except for one, should be excommunicated or removed from office, etc. Rudolphus Baucus was forced to leave his church by the advice of some, while the common people are appeased. He is a pious man, learned and of honest life with his family.</p>
      <p>Petrus Hoqqerus with his conspirators alone reigns in the fortunate isles, etc., a man wise in his own eyes and of high brow, etc.</p>
      <p>O times, o morals, I see that no counsel can remedy this evil, so much does Satan rage, except that the ears of the most gracious God the Father must be assailed with continuous prayers through Jesus Christ, lest He abandon His cause. The people must be admonished, who live in utmost luxury, to repentance of life.</p>
      <p>But where are those who will undertake this duty? You see, therefore, that all is in despair. These few words to you, most learned Bullinger, so that you may not be ignorant of our calamities, whom I beg for the sake of the Son of God, that you commend us in the public prayers of your church. We are in great danger.</p>
      <p>I pray: "It is enough for me; take, I beseech you, my soul." May the Lord's will be done. Amen. Farewell in Jesus Christ with your family and holy brothers, whom you will greet by name. A pious and holy matron greets you, who is anxious amidst so many dangers, but does not lose heart, etc. Rappoltsweiler, 5th day of October 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>Egenolphus with his wife has been feasting for fourteen days at the wedding of Lord Philipp of Hanau, etc.</p>
      <p>You understand what I mean.</p>
      <p>To the man especially distinguished in piety and learning, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord to be respected.</p>
      <p>Zurich, etc.</p>
