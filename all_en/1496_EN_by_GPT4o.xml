      <p> I have not yet been able, most illustrious man, to respond to your latest letters, nor is it possible today due to countless affairs and the French disturbances. If I knew they would last longer and that the church could not benefit in this cloudy time, I would certainly renounce this legation. For I see that His Majesty not only looks to me for Swiss affairs but almost for all others and wishes to do nothing without consulting me. But I cannot bear such a province, and my shoulders refuse it. When Mavilliacus was the legate at the Emperor's court, things went better for me because he wrote about many things that are now entrusted to me alone, a man certainly very infirm, and I would rather live quietly at home than be overwhelmed by such great and serious affairs. I suppose you have understood from the Zurich legates what has been done in the matter of the Council of Trent; nevertheless, I send a copy of the letters that His Majesty ordered to be offered in this business at the latest assembly; I took care to have them translated into German by the royal interpreters. The King made an effort to respond to the Emperor's slanders about the arrival of the Turk in the Christian world. A booklet was sent to me; but because it is written in French, I do not send it to you; but it will soon be made into German. As for the privilege concerning animals, it is necessary for that doctor to still send a memorandum; for the secretary, who was charged with expediting the privilege, wrote to me upon leaving the court that he could not send it due to the absence of the chancellor, and to prevent the matter from remaining unfinished, he entrusted the care to his son-in-law, who would send it to me at the first opportunity. When I urged this through one of my men, whom I sent to the court, the memorandum could not be found, and I think it is lost among so many papers. Therefore, I ask that it be sent to me immediately, and I will take care of expediting the privilege, as promised to me. Now I am setting out for Chamb√©ry in Savoy for the recruitment of Swiss soldiers by order of His Majesty and will not be able to return before three weeks. If you wish to write anything to me, you can send it to Calvin; for I will be passing through Geneva. Farewell. </p>
      <p> Solothurn, December 4, 1551. </p>
      <p> Yours sincerely, Maurilius Musaeus. </p>
      <p> To the highly learned, pious, noble, wise lord Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the divine word in Zurich, my kind and dear lord. Zurich. </p>
      <p> In December 1551. </p>
