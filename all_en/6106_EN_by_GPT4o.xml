      <p>Greetings. Either everything is very peaceful and calm, which is greatly to be wished for, or friends are not very dutiful, as there is a deep silence about the state of the churches and the republics. However, I have heard that the evangelical imperial orders are wisely and accurately providing for the placement of cavalry troops in certain locations, so that no army can be assembled throughout Germany against their will. Furthermore, the soldiers who have been enlisted in the Netherlands and nearby places are proceeding to fight, some going to Denmark, others to Sweden, because those kings are attacking each other with hostile arms. The Duke of Bavaria has removed Count von Oettingen, a man of rare prudence and piety, from the court and, if I understood correctly, even expelled him from his domain because of religion, which he dared to profess more freely and to admonish and dissuade the prince from undertaking more serious actions against the truth, so that this may be evidence that those devoted to the Antichrist are plotting something sinister. What our confederates are still plotting against the people of Glarus will be revealed by the assemblies; I fear greatly that such fierce spirits cannot be appeased even with unjust conditions. I hear that the people of Bern are inclined to establish peace with the Duke of Savoy; may it be obtained piously and beneficially, so that they do not have, along with the plague threatening the fate of many, also famine, the fruit of wars, especially at this time, when we are barely sustained by the rich harvest of crops, with prices meanwhile decreasing very little, as the Lord withdraws his blessing and punishes our ingratitude and impiety, as we set no limit to gluttony and greed. While I was writing this, I received letters written to the late Castellio by a certain Belgian, stating that Baldwin has completely defected from the profession of the gospel, having gone over to the enemies to such an extent that he can hardly ever return, and this with great scandal, especially in those places where many are weak and there are countless pernicious sects. But this is neither new nor unusual; the Lord will preserve his own. At the same time, I received letters from a friend stating that Mr. Ribittus, a man distinguished in learning and piety, a professor at Orléans, has fallen asleep in the Lord, and that Calvin is also gravely ill. We must pray to the Lord to look upon his church. The plague among us, although not raging violently, continues to take away some here and there. We await the will of the Lord, who may deign to mercifully prepare us for a blessed departure from this mortal life and transfer us to the heavenly homeland, when it shall be seen fit.</p>
      <p>Farewell well, most reverend and dearest brother, with your family and all your colleagues. Written in Basel on the 12th of April in the year 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in doctrine and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the church of Zürich, his most esteemed and dear lord and colleague.</p>
