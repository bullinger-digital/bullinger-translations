      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord through Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Most learned Heinrich, Paulus from Kempten has highly praised your kindness towards him to me upon his recent return, inquiring whether anything had happened in the meantime that would have required him to stay in Zürich, and having found out, he returned to his people on the 21st. Meanwhile, our Johannes, the bearer of this letter, came to me as desired, indicating that he had prepared himself for a journey towards Zürich. Having thus found the opportunity, I did not want to keep from you the troubles we are facing; the Emperor's forces threaten us with siege and the destruction of our city, and for us, the most exquisite tortures are prepared, yet our fellow citizens remain steadfast so far. A twelve-day truce has been set by the Emperor, after which, if we do not consent and submit to his Interim, they say it will be over for us. We pray with the most fervent prayers to our Father in heaven, that He may look upon their threats and hear all the words of Sennacherib blaspheming Him, by whose help we do not care a bit for the papal thunders, lightnings, and flashes. Greater is He who is in us than he who is in the world. I hope, excellent man, that we will not be swayed, but will endure to the end, supported by the prayers of your church, to which we greatly desire to commend our cause. Furthermore, we wish that you may be advised not to be overwhelmed by Spanish tricks and treacherous money, and thus be involved in similar cases. In the watch, good man, believe me, you must stand firm. Snares are being laid for you; I wish you to be warned.</p>
      <p>An army is being prepared against you, and that secretly; you must indeed be vigilant. Consider what is being plotted against you in Innsbruck, what the prince not far from Strasbourg is doing, and what the troops around are doing.</p>
      <p>They say the Emperor's son will bring with him enormous forces. You understand my mind; not everything should be committed to writing.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my Heinrich, and greet on behalf of myself and my wife, your wife and Theodor Bibliander, our compatriot, and each brother in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Jakob Fehr.</p>
      <p>Lindau, 14th of July, in the year 1548.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished lord Heinrich Bullinger, with piety and manifold learning, the Antistes of the church of Zürich, his dearest friend.</p>
