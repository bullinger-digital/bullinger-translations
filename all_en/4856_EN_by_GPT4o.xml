      <p>Grace [...].</p>
      <p>Regarding Velsius, as you write, I was unaware before, as I had read some philosophical works published by him and did not find them objectionable. Certainly, if it had been clear to me that the man's character was as you describe and as I have meanwhile discovered from conversations, I would have avoided him. But because I see it is not unclear to me, that when I discussed certain things with him, I understand it is better this way and that the Lord has arranged it so. Believe me, my esteemed lord and brother, he does not treat scripture in the Aristotelian manner, but sophistically. For Aristotle clearly teaches in the Posterior Analytics (as I have once and again reproachfully pointed out to the theologians of the Antichrist in our dialectics, as it seemed to them) that nothing should be imported from the lower professions into the higher ones, but rather from the higher into the lower. Therefore, from ethics, physics, and mathematics, he does not give us the opportunity to transition into theology, which he specifically calls the master of all, but from these into that. If he were alive, he would not only sardonically ridicule the manner of this Velsius and all the ministers of the Antichrist in disputing sacred matters, but he would also vehemently attack them and stand firmly on our side in this matter. However, he hates the adversaries of truth worse than a dog or a snake, as he has so diligently exposed their evil arts not only in the Elenchus but also in the Topics and other books, that anyone who understands his mind must be astonished. However, the obscurity gravely offends and disturbs many, as is not surprising. And indeed, it seems to me that this Velsius was not a bee in these Aristotelian gardens, but a spider. For he has indeed learned those evil tricks of deception very well, but in other matters, if he has made any progress, he cannot or does not want to use it. I discovered this only in the last conversation. For in the previous ones, he did not reveal himself in this way. And it is very true, as you write, that he does not want to be taught by anyone, but rather to be the master of all. Indeed, he is not even ashamed to lie impudently at times, as long as he can persuade others and confuse them, which Aristotle says is characteristic of sophists. Therefore, I have decided to leave him henceforth and to pray to the Lord to free both him and others from the spirit of error and confusion.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, regarding what was done with the man by the college of theologians and fellow ministers, since I was not present, I could not inform you sooner. I only received yesterday evening that he was heard and his writing was read, and a response was given. Since the academy denied a public disputation, they could not rescind that decree, but for many reasons, they greatly approved it. Therefore, let him take it well, and not interpret it as if they were avoiding the light, but rather the disturbance of the school and church. Although they would have a just cause to accuse him before the magistrate, for he has inflicted so many atrocious injuries on the church and ministry, they nevertheless forgive him for Christ's sake and are ready to confer privately and amicably with him about both the things contained in his writing and other matters, if he would deign to address anyone. Velsius responded to this that he did not come to present his matters in corners, but publicly in theaters, as they pertain to everyone.</p>
      <p>Since he was prohibited from doing so, he did not want to do anything else but shake the dust off his shoes and announce the most severe judgment of God to the enemies of truth and strike them with a terrible anathema. And thus, they parted on both sides.</p>
      <p>The next day, the man returned to a certain member of the ministers' order and delivered a virulent letter full of insults, reproaches, and excessively insolent curses, and asserted that it was written under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. And he soon reported it to the minor senate of the academy with the intention (as the one who told me these things said) to provoke our leaders to bring the man before the magistrate.</p>
      <p>However, they refused and concluded that these things should be forgiven to Velsius as a man not of sound mind and should be dismissed in peace. These are the things I did not hear myself, but learned from other trustworthy men.</p>
      <p>Thus yesterday, if the rumor is true, he set out on a journey towards your city and undoubtedly preceded these letters. You will deal with the man, I am sure, as befits apostolic men, not with the sword of the flesh, but of the spirit. If you also wish to know what I discussed with the man, I will not hesitate to inform you at another time when I have leisure. For now, I cannot give you more due to my occupations, which I ask you to consider with fairness and kindness.</p>
      <p>Grace [...] Basel, June 26, 1561.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Hospinianus.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian, the most humane man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief doctor of the church in Zürich, his lord and brother in Christ, revered and beloved. Zürich.</p>
