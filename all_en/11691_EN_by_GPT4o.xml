    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger does not need to thank, Blarer wishes to always be of service to him. The enclosed letter is from Johannes Welser, who was a good mayor in Augsburg during the implementation of the Reformation [1537], but was not re-elected; Welser wants his sons to be trained as pastors; Bullinger should keep the sending of his letter a secret. Sends back the letter addressed to Joachim [Maler]; about six months ago, to the great regret of all - probably at the wish of his wife - he moved to Lindau; as Blarer expected, this was not a blessed venture, Maler fell ill shortly thereafter and died. Sends back the writing sent by Bullinger [Zurich's against the mercenary service] and wishes success. Recommendations to [Diethelm] Röist and others. Further greetings, especially to [Rudolf] Gwalther, to whom he has not yet been able to write. The promising Melchior Fäselin, recommended by Bullinger, is still with him and sends his regards. If possible, Blarer will send a writing of the Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony] and the [Landgrave Philipp of] Hesse, in which they justify the war against [Duke Heinrich the Younger of] Brunswick[-Wolfenbüttel]; this should then be forwarded to the Bernese. Greetings and thanks for the sent part of the [Matthew] commentary. - [Enclosure:] A widowed citizen of Konstanz [Elsa (Elsbeth) Nithart] was put in the pillory for an hour after an eight-day prison sentence because she wanted to procure a young girl for the Bishop of Konstanz [Johann von Weeze], after he had pretended to her that he needed women to cure his illness according to medical advice; to the city doctor [Johann Menlishofer] he had boasted that he was by nature a "ladies' man," but nevertheless strictly adhered to his vow of chastity; [von Weeze's] reform efforts in Überlingen are not credible.</p>

      <p>And you, in turn, greetings again and again, my dearest and venerable brother. There is absolutely no need for you to thank me so often, either in your name or in the name of others; I am entirely yours, and nothing is more important to me than to serve you with all my strength in whatever matter I can.</p>
      <p>The person who wrote the other letter was elected consul in Augsburg five years ago when things were very disturbed there, and when statues were to be dismantled and other changes were full of hatred and great dangers, which more cunning people avoided with amazing skills; he truly held the office with the highest dexterity and with the praise and applause of all good people. However, after the papal abominations were expelled and things were now calm, others again insinuated themselves into the tribunes and pedarian senators with the same skills, so that they themselves were elected consuls in the past year, not without great loss to that republic, about which I would rather speak much in person than write little. His name is Johann Welser, an excellent man who loves me uniquely and beyond measure, as he has testified in countless letters. He wishes all his sons to be destined for the ministry of the Church of Christ, if he sees them appointed to that office by the Lord's kindness, and this is contrary to the custom of all others who are there, who would be very ashamed if they saw their children as preachers of the poor Christ's gospel, etc. See to it that Welser does not know that his letters to me were sent there; he has often earnestly entreated me that what he writes to me should not be to his detriment.</p>
      <p>I am returning the letters addressed to Joachim; he moved to Lindau about six months ago to take up the office of chief scribe there, to the great regret and protest of all friends and good brothers here, who wished to provide for him and his in every way. The senate offered a generous salary and worthy conditions; but he, persuaded by his wife, as they think, could not be induced by any reasoning to stay with us. I assured him as he was leaving that I had a certain premonition that the Lord would not bless that undertaking, and, alas, Christ the Savior, I was not a false prophet; for soon after he arrived in Lindau, he began to languish, and just four days ago he departed to the heavens (which I wish with all my heart).</p>
      <p>I am returning the writing you sent; I wish that what your people so piously advise, they may also persuade so happily!</p>
      <p>Commend me to the truly excellent men, remarkable for their utmost piety and prudence, to Consul Rösch, etc. I will diligently ensure that you do not find anything lacking in my faithfulness and diligence. Pray to the Lord that He may turn everything for the good and calm this roaring sea with His mighty word, granting us that solid and eternal peace in Him.</p>
      <p>Greet your entire household very lovingly, which mine also diligently greets, and commend us to Christ with your earnest prayers. Greetings to the best brothers and friends Pellicanus, Megander, Fabricius, and especially to Gwalther, that singular friend of mine, whom you should see to it that you excuse my long silence with the grace and authority you have with him. My brother and both Zwickys send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>The young man Melchior Fäselin, whom you recently recommended to me in letters, is still with me, and I hope to keep him longer. I have great hope for a future and immense benefit in him, so I cannot send him away with a clear conscience; he earnestly asks that I commend him to you and your entire household. Farewell.</p>
      <p>If I can, I will send the writing of the Elector and Hesse, in which they justify the war against Brunswick, but in such a way that you also send it to the Bernese; for my brother says that our people have received it and will send it to them. Again and again, farewell, my friend and sweetest head in the Lord. I give great thanks for the sent part of your commentaries. We will pray to the Lord that you may always both conceive and bring forth in this manner.</p>
      <p>In Konstanz, August 6, 1542. Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To Lord H. Bullinger. In Zurich.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, a citizen, who is a widow, was put in the pillory for an hour after an eight-day imprisonment because she wanted to procure a young citizen's daughter for the bishop at his request and desire. And she was shown great mercy; otherwise, she would have been thrown into a sack (drowned). But she has otherwise always been an unblemished woman, and the bishop, whom she was supposed to buy a nightgown for, cunningly deceived her with the pretense that he needed women on the advice of doctors because of his nature and illness, and that he could well justify it before God; therefore, she did not commit a sin, with many other such words, etc. These are the faithful shepherds who tend their sheep so faithfully and boast of great chastity, as then this our bishop has greatly boasted to our city doctor, when he was with him at his request, how he is a sanguine and by nature a ladies' man; but because of his office, he has made a singular vow of chastity above the common priests. "And I live chastely," he says, "the Lord lives," etc. He wanted to reform his priests in Überlingen very eagerly, the choleric the sexton. But now they can laugh in their fists, quod in eadem navi etc. et similes habent labra lactucas. May God improve this unholy unchaste chastity, etc. August 6, 1542.</p>
