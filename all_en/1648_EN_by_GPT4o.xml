      <p>Greetings in the Son of God. Our Johannes from Ulm, about to depart from here to his homeland, strongly urged and even insisted that I write to you, so much so that unless I wish to be considered either forgetful of duty or plainly ungrateful, I cannot refuse this request. Your great kindness towards me was evident during the time I lived there with Mr. Wolf, my most esteemed teacher; in this matter, I feel greatly indebted to you. Now, moreover, because you have so diligently and lovingly assisted my nephew Alexander, from my sister, with your recommendations to the most distinguished men, I am deeply obliged to you. Therefore, I would like you, most learned man, to be convinced that I will never, as long as I live, cease to support or embellish your affairs without any exception of time or place. I would promise this to you in more words if I thought you doubted my loyalty and gratitude, or if I were not more eager to prove these things by deeds rather than words. However, regarding the state of my life and studies, you will learn everything clearly from my Johannes.</p>
      <p>My lord, Dr. Latimer, had intended to write to you: but tomorrow, I swear by God, a difficult and long journey must be undertaken, so at this time the best old man, and your most loving friend, cannot send you any letters; he commands me to write to you in his name the most honorable and loving greetings. Lastly, may you fare well, and always keep us, that is, me and Alexander, recommended to you. May the merciful God, the Father and King of all generosity, faithfully reward you for everything on the last day, whom I pray and beseech with all my heart to keep you safe and sound for a long time. Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Given at Baxterley in England, the day before the calends of June, 1552. Your most devoted to your kindness, Augustin Bernher, Swiss.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief preacher among the Zürichers, his esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
