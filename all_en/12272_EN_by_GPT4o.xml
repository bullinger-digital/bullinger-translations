Additionally, he has tasked the messenger with procuring the flax [as payment] intended for [Anna, née Adlischwyler] and sending it to [Zurich]; however, the flax could become cheaper by the upcoming [12th of November] if the weather remains favorable, allowing for more to be purchased for the same price. - Bullinger is certainly informed about the Diet of Worms and the granted [Second Regensburg Religious Colloquy].

Schuler knows nothing about the papal participants. - The Schwenckfelders are causing many difficulties for the surrounding churches; in Kaufbeuren, they went to the extreme. However, the councils of Augsburg, Ulm, Memmingen, and Kempten sent delegates and, in the presence of Schuler and [Balthasar] Funk, abolished the trade with the masses and the images in the church on August 8th. Schuler knows nothing worse than these Schwenckfelders. - In Memmingen, everything is calm. - Schuler's wife [..., née Lübegger] gave birth to a son three weeks ago, who is, however, struggling with death. The woman in childbed is only somewhat well. She wishes Bullinger and [Anna] well-being. - Greetings from the councilor [Balthasar] Funk and from Bartholomäus Bertlin.</p>

      <p>Greetings. As the bearer of this letter, a patrician, was about to depart for Zurich, I decided to send you my letter through him, so that you may be informed about my affairs, incomparable friend Bullinger. I have received the cheese you sent, which I greatly enjoy, and for this benefit you have bestowed upon me, I express my immense gratitude. As you truly requested that flax be sent to your wife for the money expended, I have arranged for ten pounds of the finest flax to be sent, which the present messenger has ensured will be delivered to you. It might be possible to sell it by the following day of St. Martin the Lesser, if the current weather continues to favor us, by the Lord's grace. If it pleases you, I will not hesitate to provide your wife with greater convenience.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I do not think you are unaware of what was decided, revised, and finally permitted at the Diet of Worms. The papists are raging beyond measure, exerting all their strength against the truth. On our side, it is said that Martin Bucer, Philipp Melanchthon, Caspar Cruciger, and Veit Dietrich, the preacher from Nuremberg, have been appointed for the upcoming colloquy. Whom the papists will select, I do not know. It is hard to kick against the goads.</p>
      <p>The Schwenckfelders are causing significant trouble for the churches surrounding us. They have finally revealed their poison, hidden under the guise of hypocrisy. In Kaufbeuren, they attempted extreme measures, but the Lord prevailed through His truth, so that the entire church there accepted our doctrine in all respects. On the eighth day of August, in my presence, the councils of Augsburg, Ulm, Memmingen, and Kempten sent delegates to cleanse the sacred temple from the trade of masses and idols; I was there with Funk. All of them, in the name of their people, consoled the people of Kaufbeuren, promising assistance so that they would not be deterred by any threats.</p>
      <p>In summary: The Lord was with His own, despite the resistance of the Anabaptists and Schwenckfelders. I have never encountered a more wicked, deceitful people than the Schwenckfelders, full of envy and hatred, who go beyond, despising all sacraments and all external services of the Church of Christ. They boast much of the new birth, yet are entirely dead in the old. What shall I say? It is the true disease of all godliness! The Anabaptists are sleeping! May the Lord deliver His church from this accursed plague.</p>
      <p>With us in Memmingen, everything is calm through the Lord. My wife gave birth to a son three weeks ago. But as I write this, the child is at the brink of life. May the Lord lead him back to the eternal homeland.</p>
      <p>The woman in childbed is moderately well. She especially wishes you and your wife much well-being. Councilor Funk and Bartholomäus Bertlin send their greetings. May the Lord Jesus keep you safe for His church and for us for a long time. Farewell, excellent man, and keep me in your prayers.</p>
      <p>Given in Memmingen, August 25, 1545.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius Schuler.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the Church of Zurich, my lord, teacher, and dearest brother in Christ.</p>
