      <p>In these miserable and oppressive times, I find many different confessions of faith and catechisms. And although your confession is more than sufficient for me, some peculiar opinions from Wittenberg have moved me to create my own catechism for my household, as you will see here. I kindly ask you, in all sincerity, to read through it, amend it, and reform it according to the truth, and subsequently have it printed in 40 copies at my expense, but please omit my name. I will earnestly repay you for this, along with the reimbursement of costs, as a brotherly favor. I am now trying to withdraw myself from the court, where I am being solicited for greater honors or rather labors, especially because of the rage of the Lutherans.</p>
      <p>S. D. Your letters, most kind and distinguished man, were most welcome to me and gave me much courage because of the danger to the Lord. I would gladly write to your kindness about the very sad state of our church; but Gregory will serve as a full letter. Everything here has taken on a new face: the papists, once squalid and sad, now with uplifted spirits, extend their foreheads, running around triumphantly, boasting that the complete extermination of the entire gospel is imminent.</p>
      <p>The Lutherans, few in number, with unhealthy minds, are now curious about how honorably they will receive the deformers of the Noricans.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, the church of Christ is tormented and disturbed day and night, deprived of all human counsel and help, urging everyone with avoidance, groaning, and weeping to beseech the Lord, so that our enemies do not rejoice over us. To these, you, O brothers, join your pious prayers. Agitated by various cares and anxieties, perplexed and distracted, I can neither do nor wish to do more. You will hear much from Gregory, and much more from me, most kind man. This alone, my father, I pray, that while I linger here and await the catastrophe of this tragedy, you may deign to provide for the little church, to which I can serve with my modest ability. In the meantime, I will strive with all my might to ensure that the citizens, as before, remain in their duty, cause no disturbances, and endure everything with a calm and patient spirit until the Lord's goodness grants better times. May Christ, the best and greatest, grant that His church may long rejoice in your well-being and be able to give constant thanks to Christ. My fellow member Fridericus Wagnerus, a good and pious old man, sends his most respectful greetings to your kindness.</p>
      <p>Convey my most respectful greetings to your family in my name. Ravensburg, 21st year 1554.</p>
      <p>Devoted to your kindness, Ioannes Willingus. To the most distinguished man, the most vigilant bishop of the church of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed lord.</p>
