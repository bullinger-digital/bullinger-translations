      <p>My friendly service beforehand.</p>
      <p>Honorable, faithful, dear godfather, at your request I am sending you a calf. I have inquired about it from a neighbor. God willing, it will be convenient for you at this time. However, I have not been able to travel; because (therefore), since they are now rare, I sent it as soon as I received it. Therefore, accept my service in the best way and commend it to God. When I come to you, I will tell you what it costs.</p>
      <p>Dated Tuesday before Catherine's Day 1535.</p>
      <p>Peter Simler.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear lord and godfather.</p>
