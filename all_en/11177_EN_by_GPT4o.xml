In view of the preparations for the council in Vicenza, the rapprochement of the monarchs [Charles V and Francis I], and the Turkish threat, discord would be disastrous.

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord, most esteemed brothers and truly beloved in my heart.</p>
      <p>I hear that you are steadfastly pursuing those things on which we agreed among ourselves; may grace and praise be to the Lord. For indeed, the progress of the Gospel has been hindered too much by the fact that we have fought among ourselves; therefore, it must be most religiously avoided that we pass on this truly most pernicious dross to posterity. What you have given and what you have acknowledged are the doctrines of the Lord, in which the faith of those whom we have endeavored to reconcile with you is no less sincere than you strive to demonstrate; they also seek the glory and kingdom of Christ and the fruit of your ministry. There are those among them who, with untimely zeal, disturb more than they benefit; but neither are such importunate men lacking among you. Let us strengthen peace and agreement among the leaders, among those who have learned how necessary this peace and agreement is for the churches, and the pursuits of the inept will subside of their own accord.</p>
      <p>Nor should we be delayed by those devils: "Once differently, they return to the way, even agreeing with the papists." It is indeed better to falsely testify these things among a few, whether bad or ignorant, than to truly say this throughout the whole world: "These reformers of the churches, defenders of the scriptures, these so full of the spirit of God for so many years cannot jointly determine what their ministry is worth, what is to be attributed to the words and sacraments they administer; they tear each other apart and curse each other." Therefore, stand firm and proceed happily, most esteemed brothers, in that agreement to which the Lord has led us, that is, ensure that your people faithfully teach and are taught according to the Basel Confession. If what you profess in that confession fully prevails in your churches, we will stand firm against that demon who has stirred up so many disturbances in the church of Christ around the sacred ministry for so many years, attempting to take revenge on us who have overthrown the superstition with which he held the world around that very sacred ministry. But Christ the Savior will be present in this and in all other matters, so that the more diligently the antichrist prepares himself against us, the more we may unite our strength in Him, that is, His gifts.</p>
      <p>As it appears, you have heard about their council in Vicenza; Campegius recently came to Vicenza, joined by the other arrangers of the synod, lest they fail to properly adorn the deception through inexperience. The reconciliation of the monarchs also seems to be proceeding for them. A crowd of foot soldiers, whom Duke Christoph of WÃ¼rttemberg was to lead, had still been summoned; I hear today that their military service has been renounced. Many certainly expect the Turks; some doubt, while the Emperor and King Ferdinand themselves thus delay and prefer to endure anything rather than admit the diets of the imperial estates. May the Lord teach us: "Every kingdom divided against itself [...]".</p>
      <p>We would like to learn from you what your delegates have from Ferdinand. May the Lord be with you, and love us in Him; for we certainly both respect and cherish you in Him with our hearts as very dear. All the brothers greet you. Commend us to the best men, the consul, Habio, and others. In Strasbourg, June 3, 1538.</p>
      <p>Your M. Bucer.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and zealous men for the governance of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, Leo Jud, and the other doctors and pastors of the church of Zurich, their venerable and dearest fellow ministers and brothers.</p>
