      <p>Greetings. Not a syllable of your letters (reverend father) has been lost.</p>
      <p>Everything is safe and sound.</p>
      <p>Your great diligence, care, vigilance, piety, and humanity make us more eager, more vigilant, and more ready for everything. My error regarding the day of the assembly is grave, I confess, and I am angry with myself more than once; but this happens when many things press at once, which can hardly be properly managed simultaneously. But since it is a mistake, it is better to have erred in this direction rather than the other; for this mistake can be corrected. Mr. Coignet did write, but so succinctly that I can hardly grasp the gist of the letters, and not a word about what I wanted to know. However, he adds that Mr. Martyr was received very kindly by the queen, with whom he conversed for a long time; there is good hope; Mr. Beza delivered an elegant speech before the king, princes, and bishops. A response was expected on September 16th (for he says: "A response will be given tomorrow," but the letters are dated September 15th). He promises to write to our lords about the outcome. If nothing has reached you, it is certainly strange, and therefore I instruct him about it in my letters, which I ask you again and again to send to him when the opportunity arises. But there is no need to send them by post unless there is an opportunity.</p>
      <p>If things go well in France and Mr. Coignet writes to our people about it, as he promises (which I urge him to do in my letters), it will greatly advance our cause. For as the leaders in the Upper League have now gathered to discuss our matters and some want to wait for the outcome of the council, Cabalzar (who is among the leaders) replied: "It will not depend as much on the council as on France; we want to wait and see what comes from France. If it fails there, it will be a great blow to the pope." This was reported by Mr. Consul, who was told this in secret by someone who was present.</p>
      <p>Thus, even the papists, who are of the French faction, set their sails according to the wind of France. Therefore, it will be most advisable for you to ensure that the most favorable news is recorded and sent to us.</p>
      <p>In all these matters, I finally take refuge in one God; for what you write, alas, is too true. I leave the rest in German and am immensely grateful.</p>
      <p>We read it to the brothers in the synod.</p>
      <p>The bishop also read it, and Mr. de Rozins, but not as if I knew; for these things were presented to them by others as if I were unaware and ignorant. The bishop was much troubled while reading, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>At Chur on the same day as the rest.</p>
      <p>I will send the remaining German parts shortly.</p>
      <p>If there is any news from the fairs and you do not have time to write it down, give it to my relative, who will write it and share it with us, etc. I have not yet seen Marius.</p>
      <p>That Christian, who was recommended by you in previous years, who deserted his wife, is behaving badly, is also drunk, and there is a danger that he may return to the vomit, that is, to papism. It has been arranged with him to take back his wife within 3 weeks or leave the place.</p>
      <p>Yours most observantly, Johannes Fabricius.</p>
