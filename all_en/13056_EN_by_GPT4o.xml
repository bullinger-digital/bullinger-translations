    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Happel does not know what to communicate, as everything is unverified. Sincere efforts are thwarted by the power and intrigues of the devil, and even by one's own fault. Happel therefore does not want to write about the unstable political situation, which has become worse precisely because it was previously good, and often for the same reasons!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] For the inhabitants of Hesse, the war could not have ended better, as the enemy did not invade their territory. Thank God! However, the fortress of Gießen, which was reinforced with such great effort, must be demolished again. It is believed that such fortifications only bring strife, disaster, and danger because one tends to underestimate the danger posed by others when relying on them. What is to happen with the remaining fortresses and artillery is still unclear and not so important. It would have been better, of course, if such fortifications or weapons had never been erected or forged. Then they would not have had to be destroyed. Hopefully, this will not be the downfall of the Hessians (although Happel does not believe this).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The taxes demanded by Emperor Charles V from the Hessians were paid from church revenues and from the contributions the people made for armament. There is enough grain, and at favorable prices! Drinking continues to be excessive. Engagements and weddings are constantly celebrated; people even dance as if nothing had happened and there was no longer any danger! Happel believes, indeed he even knows, that the rich have to pay a lot. And that is also right, as they would have lost a lot (perhaps even their lives) if the enemy had invaded the country.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The school in Marburg still exists and enjoys a good reputation. How long this will last is questionable, as no one knows what the current Reichstag will bring. Happel therefore cannot urge the people of Zurich to send students, which they would hopefully do to their greatest satisfaction otherwise!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] You can also count on Happel not allowing any students entrusted to him to purchase clothing, books, and the like without his knowledge or to incur debts, and that he would also ensure that they lack nothing necessary, but also do not make unnecessary expenses (creditors willing to lend money to Zurich students at high interest rates are easily found). By the way, Happel owns a large house with suitable living quarters. He would not allow his boarders to secretly cause mischief or leave the city to roam in other regions. But not because he knows that the last Zurich students studying in Marburg had done anything dishonest (far from it!), but because he does not really like such wanderings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings, also to Bullinger's family and to his teachers Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, Konrad Gessner, and Otto Werdmüller. Happel does not want to write to each one individually, especially since there is not much to communicate and he does not want to urge anyone to respond.</p>

      <p>What certain news I should now write to you, most distinguished man, I am entirely uncertain, since there is such uncertainty and changeability in our affairs, since, I say, Satan is entirely focused and vigilant in this, to thwart and overturn our efforts, however honest, not so much by his own power, but either by power, or treachery, or even by some fault of ours, as you know indeed. Therefore, I will write nothing about public affairs, as they are uncertain and unstable, which, namely, the higher they rise and are exalted, the harder and more horribly they finally fall and are depressed, and often indeed by the same means by which they were elevated.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Regarding private matters, I have to write at present that we give thanks to the best and greatest God, since the war, which kept the enemy from the borders of our homeland, could not have ended better. With great expense, we constructed the fortification of the town of Gießen, very strong indeed, now we ourselves are again demolishing it (as for the remaining fortifications and artillery and similar defenses, what will happen is not yet known for certain, nor are we very concerned), perhaps thinking that such things are the cause and matter of great dissensions, damages, and dangers for us, while relying on them we do not hesitate to despise others before us (although who would not rather wish that they had never been either constructed or made or cast before, than now to be demolished or taken away with some of our disgrace and pain? - which I do not hope will happen, however).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The tax demanded from us by the Emperor, we paid with our provisions and subsidies received from the fortifications. There is a great abundance and cheapness of grain among us. We drink as vigorously as before, we celebrate either engagements or weddings daily, and we even dance, as if we had suffered no loss and were freed from all dangers. I believe, because we have seen, that those who possess many riches are also forced to pay much (and would have been subject to more losses and inconveniences and dangers to life if the enemy had attacked, therefore it is indeed better to squander those riches).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Our school still hangs and clings, but how firmly I do not know. For, I fear what these assemblies may bring us in terms of loss. Therefore, I cannot now advise you to send some of your young men to us, which otherwise I would hope you would do with greater pleasure.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>For if they were entrusted to me on the condition that they would not acquire any clothes and books, or similar things, without my knowledge and permission, nor contract debts elsewhere, I would indeed ensure that they lack nothing of necessary things, and that they neglect unnecessary and useful things and thus spend much less. It is indeed easy to find creditors who would easily, but at great interest and profit, entrust books, clothes, and similar things to your young men; but it is not truly for their benefit and use, and sometimes not even for their honor. Furthermore, I have a house large enough and accommodations in it not inconvenient for them; whom, if they inhabited, I would certainly not allow to secretly perpetrate anything that would be disgraceful to them, nor to leave here for some time, and wander further to visit other regions. I do not write this because I know that those who have previously been with us have committed anything unworthy of themselves and you (far from it!), but because those kinds of wanderings have somehow displeased me.</p>

      <p>Farewell with your whole family. You will greet most dutifully in my words the other lords and my teachers Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, Konrad Gessner, and Otto Werdmüller. I did not want to write to each one, both because of the lack of material and subject, and also so that I would not seem to want to impose any necessity of replying on them. Given at Marburg, 10th of September in the year 1547. Your devoted Wigand Happel.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant and worthy pastor of the church of Zurich and my reverend teacher.</p>
