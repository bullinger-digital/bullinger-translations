    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks late for the gift and for Bullinger's letter, as he was in Bad Wildbad due to a foot injury - about the cause of which he has written to Vadianus; just as he once did with Vadianus and the people of St. Gallen, he also leaves a token of remembrance to the highly esteemed Bullinger, which, however, cannot compare with the witty little books he has received. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your gift was indeed most welcome to me, most excellent and learned Bullinger, but your letter itself was even more gratifying, as in it you offer freely what I was to seek from you with utmost desire. I acknowledge, therefore, your kindness, which I also experienced firsthand when passing through there, both in you and in the other most learned and candid men, to such an extent that I have often thought to myself that I must consider how I might respond to your philanthropy and hospitality, since I see that, although I am very willing, the opportunity at that time does not allow it. It was my intention to give some sign of a grateful and acknowledging spirit. I would have eagerly done so recently with the one who brought your letter and gift to me, had his arrival not been so inconvenient for us. For I was then by chance at Bad Wildbad for the sake of my health, which had been so undermined by a long illness of six months that I could barely stand on my feet, let alone walk. I wrote about the cause of such a serious illness to our Vadianus long ago, who, after I left you, admitted me to his friendship easily the very next day in St. Gallen and pursued me with a similar kind of generous spirit. Therefore, when departing, I also left a token of my spirit and dedication towards all learned and good men with him. Since you rightfully hold the first place in their ranks, and you have already surpassed me with your kindness and generosity, it seemed fitting to leave with you as well a pledge or monument, which, although it cannot match the symbol of friendship you sent, your most elegant little books, can certainly remind you from time to time how eagerly I have embraced your friendship offered to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell and most dutifully greet the entire literary fellowship there in my name.</p>
      <p>TÃ¼bingen, on the first of July.</p>
      <p>Your Melchior Volmar.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man in doctrine and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of Zurich, his esteemed lord.</p>
