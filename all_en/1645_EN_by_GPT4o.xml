      <p>S. Briefly, some news from Augsburg, May 10: Huberinus and his companions are still preaching, but differently than at the beginning. However, it will not help them; they must leave with their chrism through the gate.</p>
      <p>The council has appointed a preacher in the hospital; he was in Memmingen years ago, named Bartholomeus; the people are following him excellently.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Mecklenburg appointed his preacher at St. Ulrich on May 8; there, many were almost crushed by each other. On the morning of May 9, he preached at St. Anna, dressed Musculus honorably.</p>
      <p>Duke Ottheinrich took Dillingen on May 4; they also had to swear to him. It is the common rumor that he will take the bishopric and make it a principality. On May 5, he entered Augsburg.</p>
      <p>All cities were there except Ulm, Nuremberg, Frankfurt, Strasbourg, Constance, Rottweil. Another day is set for Passau on May 28.</p>
      <p>On May 6, as the priests were singing vespers, some riders came to them and chased them out.</p>
      <p>On May 7, the princes dealt with the priests; no one knows what. But on the same day, they stopped ringing bells and celebrating mass and closed the churches. On this day, Duke Moritz also rode into the camp in the evening.</p>
      <p>Margrave Albrecht won a small town with a strong castle from those of Nuremberg, where 60 cannons were found; it is said to have happened as follows: The commander in the castle sent his son to Nuremberg; he went astray and fell into the hands of the margrave. He immediately brought him before the castle and wanted to hang him before his father's eyes if he did not surrender the castle. So he surrendered it before those of Nuremberg could become aware of the matter.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Augsburg is gone: no one knows where he is. Flinner and Lienhart are back in Augsburg; but because of the oath they took from the empire, they will not be reinstated until they are absolved, and they are negotiating the absolution.</p>
      <p>I hastily compiled or excerpted these from the writings sent to Musculus and me from Augsburg. Consider it well and farewell. May all yours be safe in my name and that of mine. Bern, May 24, 1552.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, his lord and esteemed compatriot.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
