    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The woman [...] delivered Myconius’ letter [No. 2943], and Bullinger fulfilled Myconius’ wish by urging both those affected in the city and in the mountains of the Zurich region to unity.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Myconius sees it quite correctly: The Emperor, this Spanish Jupiter and this half-decayed corpse, will not easily undertake anything against united [Confederates]! There are also disturbances in Italy now. If he does not succeed in settling these, he will soon lose this territory, especially since his typically Spanish greed and arrogance are detested by the Italians.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] In any case, the Confederates must be careful, for he wants to bring them under his yoke. But gradually they are beginning to see through the cunning of this rotten carcass: At the Baden Diet, they got along with each other as well as they have not in over 20 years!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Johann von Weeze, the so-called Bishop of Lund and Constance, also appeared at the Diet, but he soon departed because he did not feel welcome there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The Confederates have addressed a joint letter [dated July 9, 1547] to the Emperor. It concerned Basel, Mulhouse, and Rottweil. They demanded a response (Myconius will have learned more details about this from his authorities). They further swore to help each other as soon as the Emperor would attack a place or city of the Confederation.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The dispute over Rudolf Gwalthers’ “Endtchrist” should now also be settled, as the envoys from Lucerne and Unterwalden [Heinrich Fleckenstein and Hans Bünti] had a friendly conversation about it with the Zurich envoys [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Itelhans Thumysen] on the sidelines of the Diet. But even if they agree, they are dependent on God's grace, as this alone enables genuine and not feigned cohesion. It is only attained through true faith and sincere repentance! Therefore, [the population in our sermons] must be diligently encouraged to do so!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] What the French envoy [Sébastien de L’Aubespine, abbé de Bassefontaine] presented at the Diet on behalf of his King Henry II, Myconius will know better.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Are there any news from the Netherlands and England? In England, the Gospel is said to be flourishing again.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Johannes Gast has not yet confirmed the receipt of the money for the wool. Greetings to him and to Francisco de Enzinas.</p>

      <p>The woman delivered your letters to me. I will do as you advise, and I am diligently and carefully urging not only our fellow citizens but also acquaintances and friends in the mountains towards unity and unanimity.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>You judge correctly that the Spanish Jupiter, that decaying corpse, will not easily attack those who are united. Furthermore, there are disturbances arising in Italy, and unless he quells them, he will not hold Italy for long: the Italians hate the Emperor because of the Spaniards and their greed, arrogance, and intolerable pride.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>However, whatever the case may be, we must be vigilant: A yoke is being prepared for us! The Swiss are beginning to open their eyes and see the deceit of the rotten corpse. At the Baden Diet, they agreed among themselves better than they have in over 20 years.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Bishop of Lund, who is also called the Bishop of Constance, came, but seeing himself as an unwelcome and little-accepted guest, he soon returned to where he came from.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>The Swiss have written a joint letter to the Emperor concerning Basel, Mulhouse, and Rottweil. They demand a response, which you have undoubtedly learned more about from your sources. They have conspired among themselves so that there is no doubt that whoever harms one of the cities or regions harms them all.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The dispute, which began to spread because of Rudolf Gwalthers’ "Endtchrist," is believed to be settled, as only the Lucerne and Unterwalden representatives spoke amicably with our envoys and inquired, promising that once the complaint was set aside, everything would be happy and friendly. However, even if we are in agreement, we still need above all the favor of the divine and the grace of the Holy Spirit, which binds us together more closely and not hypocritically, but truly. We will obtain this through true faith and faithful repentance, which unless we urge ourselves and all to receive and demonstrate piously, we will be handed over to the hands of our enemies. Let us therefore be diligent here!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>You know better what the French envoy has done and what he has proposed in the name of his king.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>If you have any certain news from the Netherlands and England, where it is said that Christ and evangelical piety are flourishing again, let me know.</p>

      <p>Farewell together with all yours.</p>

      <p>Johannes Gast has not yet responded whether he has received the money sent for the wool. Greet him together with Francisco de Enzinas. Zurich, July 16, 1547. Your Bullinger.</p>
