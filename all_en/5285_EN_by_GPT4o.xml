      <p>Greetings. The envoy from Solothurn is doing everything possible to prevent the Swiss from sending soldiers to kill, but rather to send peacemakers to establish peace. However, since he is ordered in the king's name to request soldiers from the Swiss envoys, who will meet on April 26th, he cannot suppress the king's letters, especially since Frölich, sent from the court, is remarkably eager and sends messages through the cantons urging them to hurry. Therefore, since I absolutely think that soldiers should be sent by the Swiss who are in alliance with France, it is worthwhile to inform Prince Condé and the faithful, so that they may act quickly before the opposing side unites all their forces.</p>
      <p>There is a remarkable scarcity of all things among the Swiss, therefore countless soldiers will enlist. If Condé had some captains among the Swiss, there is no doubt that he would have many more soldiers than the others. I took care to have his letter translated into German and presented it to the council.</p>
      <p>He was unaware of all this.</p>
      <p>It affected many greatly.</p>
      <p>I also sent a copy to the Rhaetians, to hinder the plans of the adversaries there as well. There is no doubt that shameless lies are being presented to the Swiss envoys from whom soldiers are requested.</p>
      <p>Coignet is not suspected by me in this matter. They have others who claim that Condé is a seditious disturber of the kingdom, and therefore should be suppressed along with his followers: that the queen and king, out of hatred for the new religion and because of the disturbances caused, have defected to the Guise, etc. I wanted to inform you of this in time so that you may consider what is needed.</p>
      <p>Let us pray without ceasing to the Lord that He may be with us and scatter the bloody plans of the impious. Farewell together with the brothers, fellow ministers, and all friends.</p>
      <p>Yesterday I also wrote to you through Solothurn. I pray that you continue to share all matters concerning France that are brought to you from there.</p>
      <p>For we are in pain and anxiety and in great expectation. May the Lord be with us.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 20, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yours whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Calvin, most faithful pastor of the church of Geneva and his most esteemed and dear brother.</p>
