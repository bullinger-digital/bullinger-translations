    <p xml:id="regest1">In response to Bullinger's complaint about too infrequent news, Gast replies that he does not want to disturb the overworked Bullinger with trivial matters.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Gast has not received Bullinger's letter to Gilbert Cousin, which was entrusted to his brother Antoine for further delivery. The letter should have arrived at Gilbert in Nozeroy by now.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Emperor Charles V is likely planning something against the Swiss Confederation, as he has moved cavalry to Besançon and is recruiting a massive army. However, Bullinger is better informed about this than Gast. Some believe that Charles V wants to subdue the Swiss, while others think he will abandon this endeavor to his disgrace. Undoubtedly, he will want to attempt this, even if all soothsayers predict disaster for him. Gast fears that the Swiss deserve a severe punishment. May it be paternal. The Swiss should have been punished long ago, especially since they have often been called to repentance. Even the prophets did not point out people's errors and proclaim God's punishment in vain, but they even had to pay with their lives for it!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">The Basel council has ordered a weapons inspection to be held in the coming week [January 29 to February 4] due to the high number of new citizens.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Philipp Melanchthon is giving lectures again in Wittenberg, feeling downcast, and is trying to gather the scattered professors and students. Many do not want to serve Duke Maurice of Saxony and refuse to support the rebuilding of the University of Wittenberg.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Magdeburg is under imperial ban and is preparing for defense. Count Christoph of Oldenburg, who lost his entire inheritance and had to go into exile because of the Gospel, serves as their military leader. Meanwhile, Duke Maurice, together with the arsonist Heinrich the Younger of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, is raising an army against Magdeburg. How well they complement each other!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">The three sons of the imprisoned Johann Friedrich I of Saxony, Johann Friedrich II the Middle, Johann Wilhelm I, and Johann Friedrich III the Younger, are near Erfurt in Weimar with their mother, Sibylle of Jülich-Cleves-Berg. After their forced departure from their homeland [Albertine] Saxony, they anxiously await the release of their father. However, there is no reliable news about this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">The Council of Trent will completely stifle the seed of the Gospel unless God intervenes.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">Greetings. Gast will write when he has more reliable news.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[P.S.:] Martin Bucer has been summoned by the Emperor to a new religious discussion [in Augsburg]. Philipp Melanchthon will also come with Johannes Brenz. This will be something! Bucer set out on January 24 [1548] [to Ulm].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">Gast asks Bullinger for a copy of the article on the separation of lepers, which the Zurich marriage court follows.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. You complain about my infrequent writing and negligence. However, since there is no subject worthy of your studies and our friendship, I consider it better to remain silent than to burden you, already overwhelmed with other matters, with trivialities.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Gilbert has letters sent to me, which I have given to his brother to deliver.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>You know better than we do about the Emperor's plans. He is plotting something against Switzerland. For he has sent several cavalry to Besançon and is recruiting a massive army. The common and widespread rumor is that the Emperor wants to bring the Swiss under the yoke or disgracefully abandon the endeavor he has begun. He will undoubtedly try his luck, even if all soothsayers predict extreme misfortune for him. Our sins are a severe scourge, but we hope it is paternal. They should have suffered long ago, often called to repentance. But the pious prophets labored in vain, who even testified with their own blood that we err greatly and that God will pour out His wrath against the impenitent.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Our senate has decided to inspect the citizens' arms in the coming week due to the large number of new citizens.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Melanchthon is lecturing again in Wittenberg with a sad heart, gathering the scattered school. Many of the learned do not want to serve Maurice and refuse to contribute to the rebuilding of the school.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Magdeburg is under the Emperor's excommunication and is preparing to resist. They have a leader, Baron of Oldenburg, who, stripped of all paternal goods, is in exile because of the Gospel. Duke Maurice, lest I say anything harsher, is preparing an army against the Magdeburgers, to which the incendiary of Brunswick will join; a fitting pot for the kettle.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>The Dukes of Saxony, the sons of the captured Duke, live in Weimar with their mother. The estate is not far from Erfurt. They were forced to leave Saxony, their native land, and thus await with anxious hearts the liberation of their father, about which we hear nothing certain.</p>

      <p>The Council of Trent will completely suffocate the scattered seed of the Gospel unless the Lord's power resists.</p>

      <p>Farewell. More and more certain news soon. Basel, January 25, 1548. Yours, Gast.</p>

    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Martin Bucer has been summoned by the Emperor to a new religious colloquy. Melanchthon will also come with Brenz. We will see wonders. Bucer left on Tuesday, January 24.</p>

      <p>I also ask you to send me a copy of the article on the separation of lepers, which you observe in the matrimonial consistory.</p>

      <p>What has happened in Steckborn with the youths? These will undoubtedly be the beginnings of the Swiss war!</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my dear benefactor. Zurich.</p>
