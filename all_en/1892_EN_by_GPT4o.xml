      <p>Greetings. All the brothers who were gathered here at our fair gave you immense thanks for having deigned to read our proposals and for having so kindly advised us on them. You are doing what befits a humane and pious man. I did not want to write to you until it had first been accepted again by everyone; now I have begun to write it down and will send it shortly. All the Italians accepted it, although they seemed to accept it with less enthusiasm. However, they openly objected to three articles: unleavened bread, godparents in baptism, and that the father of the child should not baptize him himself; they did not want to accept these. We advised the people to follow what leads to peace and edification, and not to resist those who wish to accept godparents; to use common bread if they do not want unleavened bread; and finally, that the article stating that the father should not baptize his own children was not placed by us without reason, especially in this age. We dismissed them more favorably, except that they say your form of baptism is longer, while ours is even longer. However, they will remain in office; for they promised us this in good spirits as they departed. - The envoy, who is here in the name of the King of France, invited Father Comander and me to dinner; we went, dined, listened to the man speak quite a lot, and noticed that he is a very learned man and also skilled in Greek. He reads our books and holds them very precisely: he speaks of faith modestly and cautiously. Once, as a young man, he lived for some time in Wittenberg, very familiar with Luther and Melanchthon, and always testifies that they are good men. I know courtiers to be cunning and deceitful; yet I cannot be persuaded that this one fights against the gospel. When we know more, we will write more. I hear that on May 16, the King of France burned four Christians in Lyon for their faith; they said they were from Bern. Farewell, most esteemed man. Comander and friends greet you. Traversus excuses himself for having been unwell for a long time; certainly, we have not seen him here for a long time, nor does he appear anywhere. From Chur, June 6, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Philipp.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
