      <p>Greetings. You could hardly have cheered me more than with your recent letter, in which you briefly, yet thoroughly, respond to everything I desired to know. You write about the completion of the fourth Decade, about the Prussians, about the removal of gout, and about other matters, which I read with pleasure.</p>
      <p>I do not strongly approve of the nine articles to be proposed at the assembly; they are either antichristian or tyrannical; let them be dismissed. I hear that Bishop Vergerius is with you, who himself also wrote certain things about the Augsburgers to Mr. Wissenburg, among which are also the nine articles you sent; I am surprised that he does not even greet me.</p>
      <p>The document enclosed with my letter is horrendous concerning the god of the papists; I had it copied and translated into German under the name Rischach. He is going to send this picture to certain nobles, so that the Roman god may become known to as many as possible. At the end, I subscribed: "From Italy," so that the good man who sent the writing may not be suspected. What do you think will happen to monarchs, princes, bishops, monks, and all who set their mouths against heaven in this time? May the Lord therefore grant this one thing, that we may prevail in the word and patiently endure and bear what will be imposed on us for that very reason.</p>
      <p>It was thought by many that there would be no assembly, because the arrival of the princes was so delayed. Now we hear that they are arriving in sufficient numbers, except for those who are involved in wars. Indeed, I fear a very severe famine, unless the Lord prevents it by a miracle. Some of our people were in Augsburg, only to see the Emperor (although they did not see him; for he had gone to Bavaria); they said that for one small meal, 7 florins had to be paid. How long do you think this assembly will last if a multitude gathers? But concerning all these things, let the Lord see to it.</p>
      <p>A certain heretical inquisitor came to Leuven, who, while trying to impose destruction on the students, stirred up a very great tumult; for the citizens sided with the students. A similar report is told about Antwerp.</p>
      <p>Schertli's son added this: all the English merchants, along with their goods, have departed; if true, Antwerp is nothing.</p>
      <p>This happened in Strasbourg: some counts, along with their servants, were walking through the streets; the servants, craftsmen, stood staring at them with grim looks, for they were canons, with no reverence shown. While this matter displeased one of the servants, he said: "You disgrace the box of Mars; should you not reach for a little hat." One of the servants replied: "Hey, that disgraces you," etc.</p>
      <p>Then the servant, having drawn his sword, began to cause a commotion; the craftsmen chased them with stones and hands, so that their shoes fell off. What will happen, I do not know.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with yours. May Gwalther, Pellican, Otho, etc., be safe.</p>
      <p>Basel, August 13, 1550.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>Write about Augsburg either you or Gwalther henceforth. May the Lord be present with his church.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most learned theologian, in his Lord. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
