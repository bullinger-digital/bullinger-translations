    <p xml:id="regest1">The letters from May 7 [No. 1267f] only came to light at Grynaeus on June 6. After initial skepticism towards the mediators and the concessions [of the Schmalkaldic League], Myconius now hopes for advantages from the Nuremberg Religious Discussion, as it will become apparent, independent of the opponents' behavior, on whose side the right is. He fears that Karlstadt's hatred against him has been further intensified by a letter from Theodor [Bibliander]; after [the theologians] have expressed themselves in writing [against the new university statutes], there are now new discussions. His earlier communications about Duke George [of Saxony] are based on the statements of a messenger [George of Württemberg], who also reported that a large part of the University of Wittenberg has already been relocated to Leipzig. Johannes [Lüthard] has made a copy of the submission [of the theologians] and will also report orally. Birth of [Samuel] Grynaeus.</p>

      <p>Greetings. The letters you sent us on May 7 were finally found by chance on June 6 in the house of Mr. Grynaeus; for while he was tearing up a piece of paper, the letters fell out of it.</p>
      <p>Therefore, do not be surprised that there has been neither a response to them nor a return of Doctor Vadianus's letter.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Nuremberg assembly, at first, when I heard about it, I was greatly disturbed; for many and various thoughts came to mind, especially because I had heard that some unknown arbitrators were to be appointed by the Emperor and Ferdinand, who were supposed to be the peacemakers of the dispute. There was also the complaint of some who were involved in the Frankfurt delegation, who were very grieved by the negligence with which they had conducted whatever belonged to the Lord. However, just as this pain, so too the joy in Christ's mercy, who, not considering human negligence but his own cause, had brought the matter to the articles you know, although even here it was not otherwise satisfied than while we are compelled to consider what happened with fairness. In those articles, especially those pertaining to the assembly, much was certainly allowed to the princes as mediators, such that Joachim would entirely incline towards the gospel, and the Palatine would approach more and more each day. In the assembly, they thought it would happen that, however the matter fell, equity would stand with us; for if they eluded this, there is a reason why the enemies could not bear a free council; if they transgressed anything present, they would again be manifest. If, as agreed, it succeeded, there would be hope that God's cause would be better heard among many from the number of adversaries, even if the rest would be more vehemently moved by fury and would institute the most cruel persecution; for then indeed what Christ truly promised to his faithful would happen, and he will undoubtedly give constancy and perseverance to the end. However, the hearts of the pious will be made much more solid, whatever happens, after they have done everything among the enemies that was fitting, to win them over to the common Lord, even if in vain. Add to this that it was also very carefully considered with what extreme difficulty those could be united, to whom nothing could be more separate. We call the Pope the Antichrist and all his supporters the servants of the Antichrist; he, on the other hand, calls us heretics and schismatics and deserters of the church. What kind of union, I ask, could there be, by which such separate, indeed truly contrary things could be joined? I say freely: It will not be. We know the Pope will not leave his place; we know ours will not yield from the sentence of salvation. To what end, then, the assembly? So that what has been published in books hitherto in vain, may be heard, discussed, and debated in person, and compel the adversaries to defend their own against the truth and conscience or to yield, then so that the world may know how the truth does not fear the light.</p>
      <p>For it is known how badly we have been heard so far about the flight from the council. Therefore, after I heard these things and considered them according to my weakness, the disturbance was so diminished that I, with many, begin to fear that the enemies may not come to Nuremberg. I do not know what hope holds me, that when the parties have opened their minds to each other, everything will be more fortunate for us, whether we are compelled to endure persecution or obtain peace in truth. Thus indeed I pour these things out to you, as I see you have also done, [for?] I commit those great things to the Lord; he will preserve his own, whatever we meanwhile lose through negligence.</p>
      <p>As for the rest: Theodor did not please me by writing to Karlstadt; for it greatly aggravated the man's hatred against me. He suspects that I incited Theodor. Whatever is done against him, he suspects has come from me. While he is with me, he is flattering, smiles, venerates; when he is absent, it is amazing how gravely he accuses me, especially wishing himself expelled. I speak of these things to you.</p>
      <p>What you teach, with which you console and strengthen, know that it is most pleasing and delightful to me, indeed and will bring, when the time comes, utility. We have once given an account of why we fight against the established laws, to the lords and the choice of the university. They asked us to offer them a written response; we complied. Now therefore they think, consult, dispute, write, and try to defend what they nevertheless publicly denied having established, namely the laws. What kind of people do you judge such men to be? More about these things after we see with what arms they will defend their own.</p>
      <p>Regarding Duke George, I recently asked the notary, who had come to my house, sent by his prince to Basel, everything I wrote to you. He asserted everything with this addition that his prince, out of great joy, feared that things had turned out this way, and a large part of the University of Wittenberg has already been transferred to Leipzig and everything is going well.</p>
      <p>I gave to Brother Johannes to copy what we offered to our masters. They are excerpts from a very long writing that we compiled so that, if necessary, the senate would have a way to defend our own. He will narrate with a full mouth how miserably we are vexed because we lack titles and resist.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your household and vigorously pursue the way of the Lord. Basel, June 8, year 39.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>The night before, Mr. Grynaeus received a son from his wife, with what joy you can imagine! etc.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful and learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Zurichers, his venerable brother in the Lord.</p>
