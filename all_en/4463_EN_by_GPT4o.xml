      <p>Reverend and highly learned, especially gracious, dear sir and good friend, I have now received several letters from you, the last one given in Zurich on the 8th of August, and with it a booklet on Christian doctrine, and since I was at home at that time, I did not fail to immediately respond to you through the young bearer of that letter; however, I was at that time in Mittelstetten, on my late father's estate. Therefore, I kindly ask you not to hold it against me, and I thank you for your honor.</p>
      <p>I would like to know how I might reciprocate. For I have also read with pleasure the book you wrote against the Anabaptists. I would also like to repay your news; however, during my stay in Augsburg, it has been very quiet. As you write, there is a strong effort to convene a council; this current pope would gladly make his cousin, the one from Ems, the bishop of Constance (despite the fact that the current one has not yet died).</p>
      <p>As for the events, they are not seen as good; for that city is a good pass to come into our land. However, I assume that whatever they intend, God will also have his part in the game. As for a meeting of some princes with the imperial majesty around Vienna, I have heard nothing; although it is said that a new Reichstag is to be proclaimed; what follows, we will soon find out.</p>
      <p>You may already know that the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg is holding a shooting in Stuttgart; much is being discussed about it, and it is said that the Duke of Saxony will soon hold one as well, etc. I hear in these lands that things are going quite well in France; from there I can inform you of the situation, and if you write to me, address your letter to Lyon; make sure to know that if it is opened by the authorities, it will not cause me any disadvantage.</p>
      <p>I might stay there for 3 months, unless the circumstances become too difficult. With that, I now commend you to the almighty God.</p>
      <p>In Baden, the 22nd of September 1560.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant, Philipp Welser.</p>
      <p>To the reverend and highly learned Heinrich Bullinger, leader of the church in Zurich, my dear sir and good friend. Zurich.</p>
