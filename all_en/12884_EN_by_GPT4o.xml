    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Good that Myconius is feeling better again! May the Lord keep him in His church for a long time. He should fully dedicate himself to it!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The Zurich envoys [Johannes Haab and Itelhans Thumysen], who are still at the Baden Diet, have not conveyed any news. Therefore, Bullinger has not heard anything about the letter from Emperor Charles V mentioned by Myconius.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Strasbourg will hardly be pardoned under different conditions than the other cities, which were dazzled by the Emperor with fine promises. In the end, it will be seen from whom [these promises originated]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Great things are reported about Augsburg's pardon. However, credible people report that the city was badly deceived. On February 21, it had to take in six imperial banners. Six more are to follow. Soon it will be seen what this scum dares once it feels superior!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Ulm and the other miserable cities are already a good example of this. Why did they have to surrender, take in foreign garrisons, and give up their freedom? Surely God punishes the unrepentant people for their ingratitude in this way.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] The Emperor will only pardon the city of Strasbourg if it takes in troops. He wants to display his victory and the subjugation of Germany in the most important German cities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] May Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony be victorious! However, it is likely that he too will be abandoned by his allies, unless God intervenes. In Hegau, landsknechts who have returned wounded from a lost battle are telling that the Elector has won and about 3000 imperial troops have fallen. Charles V is said to have left Ulm on February 26 and is marching against the Elector.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Myconius' assessment of the Emperor and the Pope [Paul III] is accurate. Both only cover up their machinations to better lead people by the nose. It is all the more important to continue proclaiming the Gospel of Christ, the true priest and faithful king, who will soon judge all! Greetings, also to the colleagues. Written around nine o'clock in the morning.</p>

      <p>S. I congratulate you, my honorable Myconius, on your regained health, which may the Lord make long-lasting, so that you may continue to be useful to His church for a long time; to which you should also direct all your efforts!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>We have no certain news from the Baden Diet even at this hour. For our envoys have neither returned nor written any letter about anything. Therefore, I can write nothing about the Emperor's letter, which you write about, nor about any other matters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Strasbourg will hardly be received back into favor under different conditions than other cities, which he blinds with sweet words and a certain storm of promises; in the end, it will be seen from whom.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Splendid things are said about the reception of Augsburg. I understand from trustworthy people that the miserable have been shamefully deceived by flattery. On February 21, six imperial banners were received into the city. They say six more are expected. When he considers himself superior in number and strength, you will see what this scum of men is going to attempt.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Ulm and the other miserable cities provide an example. Why do the pitiful (miserable) people have to surrender like this? Why do they take in the devil's people? Why do they not keep their cities unblemished and independent? But this is the hand of the Lord striking us for our ingratitude and our life that does not know how to repent.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>The Emperor will not reconcile with Strasbourg unless some banners are received into the city. For he wants everywhere and in all the most powerful cities of Germany to have clear signs of his victory and the most shameful submission of the Germans to be displayed and shine forth.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Would that the Saxon wins to the glory of God's name and the consolation of the afflicted! Yet I fear that he too will be deserted by his allies in due time. But perhaps the Lord has seen otherwise. In Hegau, I hear it is being spread by soldiers returning with bloody heads from an unfortunate battle that the Saxon has won and about 3000 of the Emperor's men have fallen. Whether this is said to be true or false, I do not know and I doubt. They say the Emperor moved from Ulm against the Saxon on February 26.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>You judge rightly about the concord and discord of the Emperor and the Pope. I think it is the bitterness of the cuttlefish. It is trickery with which they deal with people. May the devil indeed trust them! Rather, let us proclaim the kingdom of God and the saving gospel of the Son of God, our priest and king, who acts sincerely, deceives no one, and is soon to come in justice, to judge the living and the dead. Let us strive to please Him in all things! Farewell in Him with all good people. Zurich, March 4, around 9 in the morning, 1547. Greet the brothers. Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Basel.</p>
