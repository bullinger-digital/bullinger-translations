      <p>Greetings. The reason you did not receive sooner, most illustrious man, what was communicated to me, is due to many causes; for firstly, the rains hindered our locals, so that almost no one traveled to you during these three or four weeks. Secondly, those who were going did not want to take those writings from me, nor did I dare to entrust them safely, fearing they could not be protected well enough from the rains and thus the writings would perish or at least not be returned intact. Furthermore, what was more serious, from that time I fell into a more severe illness for some time, during which I was unable to write or read anything at all, and I did not want to share with others to copy, but as soon as I was recovering, I completed everything. Additionally, I always awaited a faithful and certain messenger, as I now have.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I do not think that delay should be attributed to either my levity or negligence, nor should you doubt anything, for you will soon (God willing) receive it. If you send the confession of Beza and Varelli with your declaration, I would also wish, if you have received any response from them, to be added to the confession.</p>
      <p>Recently, I compiled all these things, so that they might be better preserved from the rain and more easily carried. My fellow ministers and I express immense thanks to your kindness for those Italian and Picardian novelties; for we could gather nothing certain from anywhere; all or most who knew something of this were cautious not to communicate it to us; for the papists and the French fear a worthy reproach. Now the same has also been brought by merchants from Lyon.</p>
      <p>We have no news of new matters, except those about which you perhaps have more certain and more information for us.</p>
      <p>The cavalry of Bolvileri, 2000 strong, and 20 companies of infantry have settled in the valley called das Speichinger Thal, which is perhaps 7 miles from here, more or less, and they still remain there. Therefore, here there is very serious and careful watch and great custody day and night, with much annoyance to the citizens and senators. It is rumored that they will pass through Alsace, cross the Rhine, and head for Burgundy. Others say they might perhaps go to Konstanz, so that the Swiss soldiers are prevented from aiding the French, etc.</p>
      <p>But time will reveal all things.</p>
      <p>May you always, for your ancient and customary kindness towards us, deign to communicate what you have for the reasons recited before, and as you have been accustomed to do until now, keep us and our church commended. My fellow ministers all greet you and all your collaborators and express the highest thanks for that excessive kindness and beneficence with which you recently received us; for we cannot repay in kind. Farewell in the Lord, who may keep you long surviving for us.</p>
      <p>Schaffhausen, 9th of September, 1557.</p>
      <p>Jakob Rüeger, most devoted to your kindness.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in learning and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful ecclesiast of Zürich, his most esteemed lord and brother in Christ.</p>
