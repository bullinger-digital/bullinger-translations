      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I have nothing at this time to write; what was being circulated among us, I wrote about in those days, and I believe you have received my letters from a certain citizen of Zurich. What is happening in Saxony, you can inquire about most diligently from the courier.</p>
      <p>Magdeburg is being besieged very severely; so writes someone to me; the letters are dated May 29: "Three days ago, they fought fiercely; skirmishes are held almost daily.</p>
      <p>The army is seen again near LÃ¼neburg; against whom, it is unknown. Saxony will be greatly disturbed this year.</p>
      <p>Many omens are seen; there is great despair among people, many hang themselves, stab themselves, drown in the waters.</p>
      <p>All the devils are raging in our places. Bishop Sodomus of Merseburg, while visiting the churches to preach, was suddenly struck by dysentery and is gravely ill."</p>
      <p>You will learn more from the courier, who will tell various stories about that siege. The pious men resist bravely.</p>
      <p>What is happening at the Diet in Baden? Gumpenberg will undoubtedly disturb our people, and the ecclesiastical goods will eventually, God forbid, bring us great harm.</p>
      <p>I also wish to know whether you will publish anything this summer and what thoughts you currently have that you intend to make public. Farewell. Basel, June 20, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius.</p>
      <p>Greet D. Theodor in my name, to whom I will write shortly, as soon as I receive letters from Strasbourg, which I am expecting at any moment about various matters.</p>
      <p>In Hesse, not to overlook this, the preaching of the Gospel is still heard very clearly, and scarcely 8 can be found in that entire region who would be sent. The prince is still held in very harsh captivity.</p>
      <p>To the honorable master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in Zurich, my gracious lord, to his hands. Zurich.</p>
