    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Vadian thanks for Bullinger's letter [not received]. He will advocate in writing for the pious Hans Muntprat with the people of Augsburg this coming Friday [April 8]. There is no lack of money; if only there were good sense as well! Horace rightly said that wealth and stupidity get along! Enclosed is a letter from Muntprat's son [...] from Spain. Perhaps it contains good news.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Vadian sends along [a report] about the debate that took place last winter in the city council of Augsburg [when the submission of the city to Emperor Charles V was debated], where there was a clash between human reason and the spirit of Christ. It was once again shown how little man is inclined to suffer for Christ's sake, or how quickly he can abandon the teachings of Christ he has acknowledged! In this discussion, the situation was completely misunderstood! They could have helped themselves, but no one was brave enough to prevent the decision [to pay homage to the Emperor]. Vadian suspects that the patricians along with the merchants of the [southern German] imperial cities were willing from the beginning of the war, when the Emperor wrote to these cities, to listen to him and defect from the [Schmalkaldic] League. But it was the pious councils who remained steadfast and showed greater willingness to repent than those moneybags and rich money changers. The pious man was thus betrayed by these rich people, who enjoy a good reputation at the imperial court! Now they are trying to restrict the powers of the guilds and expand those of the rich. The Emperor has promised them much, so that their betrayal and machinations are to blame for the imperial occupation troops entering the cities. Through unilateral exercise of power, the oligarchy will shape everything according to their will and oppress the people! This monstrous situation is due to the excessive wealth of a few, which was rightly abhorred by the old, strong Germany. It would be good if the Zurich mayors Johannes Haab and Hans Rudolf Lavater, indeed the entire council, were informed of the aforementioned report. The people of Zurich should then also send a copy of this report to the people of Bern and the other [Protestant places].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The Emperor arrived in Nuremberg in a litter on March 22 and made an appearance. 2000 foot soldiers and 1000 cavalrymen were relocated to the city. During the day, the imperial forces guard the city gates, which are opened by the council in the morning and closed in the evening. The night watch is held by two imperial companies. It is assumed that the Emperor will not stay long in Nuremberg. An epidemic is rampant among his mercenaries, and he himself is in poor health. However, Elector Johann Friedrich I of Saxony is armed. Given the strength of his opponent, he will have to rely on God's help.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] After the issuance of a tyrannical mandate by King Ferdinand I, the Bohemians have formed a league among themselves and rebelled against the king. In Nuremberg, there is a rumor that they no longer want to recognize him as king. Perhaps they will help the Elector.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Frightening letters have arrived from Hungary about the plans of Sultan Suleiman I. There is particular concern in Transylvania. Last winter, Turkish bands are said to have roamed Hungary, advancing as far as the mining towns and capturing and selling over 12,000 Christians of all ages.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] It is confirmed that Duke Maurice of Saxony is besieged in Dresden by the Elector and that he has taken the important mines of King Ferdinand (Marienberg and Joachimsthal).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Strasbourg is said to have paid homage to the Emperor and shown itself very submissive in doing so. The Emperor knows how to make friends in order to then seize the heads [of the Schmalkaldic League: Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony and Landgrave Philip of Hesse] unhindered! But once he has achieved his goal, he will adhere to his promises only at his discretion and pursue his goal with further promises or with force, to deliver all of Germany (if God does not prevent it) to the Spaniards and Italians. Hopefully, the Swiss Confederation and France will not have to bear the brunt of it. That could be bad! But these are only concerns that pertain to this world, which must not be placed before the pursuit of the hereafter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Greetings.</p>

      <p>My willing service always beforehand. Especially gracious dear sir, your recent letter has reached me well, and as far as the pious Hans Muntprat is concerned, I will diligently advocate for him this coming Friday in Augsburg, with the intention that the good man should be helped; for there is no lack of means, if only there were sound judgment. But it is true what Horace mentions: Wealth endures foolishness, etc. Herewith I send you a little letter, coming from Hans Muntprat's son from Spain; it might also contain some good news.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Send your honor along with it a remarkable conflict between human reason and the spirit of Christ, which took place last winter at the council in Augsburg, etc., in which one learns how difficult it is for the flesh to suffer for the sake of Christ's teachings. Conversely, it is seen how lamentable it is to abandon or surrender those teachings once they have been embraced. O God, how poorly these people have understood it! They could have acted with good counsel themselves; but there was no true resolute seriousness involved. I finally suspect that the rich and influential of all these cities were initially, as the Emperor wrote to them, willing to defect from the League and fall away; but the pious communities held firm and had more seriousness in their repentance than the priests and rich money changers. Consequently, the pious common man (I would like to say) was betrayed and subdued, while the rich are well at court, and it is being arranged that the power of the guilds is weakened and the rich are helped to extend their splendor and power. The Emperor has promised them much, and therefore garrisons are admitted through the betrayal and machinations of the magnates, and there will be no end to tyranny until everything is finished according to their pleasure with the oppressed populace. These monstrosities are nourished by excessive wealth, from which old and strong Germany rightly recoiled, etc. I would like my gracious lords, the mayors, to hear it too, and if it seemed appropriate, even the senate should hear it, and an example should be sent to the people of Bern and other cities. For unless I am mistaken, everything will serve our cause and the common business.</p>

      <p>The Emperor entered Nuremberg on March 22 in a litter; he made a public appearance and showed himself as the rightful Emperor. He has stationed 2000 foot soldiers and 1000 cavalry in the city and the imperial forces keep watch during the day under the gates; the council, however, opens and closes in the morning and evening; the Emperor has the night watch held with two companies of foot soldiers. It is thought he will not stay long there. The plague is rampant among his people, and he himself is not strong. Meanwhile, the Elector is in strong armor; he will, however, have to rely solely on the help and grace of God, for the enemy is strong.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The Bohemians have risen with great power, having made a league against a tyrannical mandate of King Ferdinand, and it is said in Nuremberg that they no longer want to recognize him as king; therefore, it is thought that Bohemia will be decisive for the Elector. Time will reveal this.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>From Hungary, there are terrible writings about the coming of the Turk; it is feared that everything will go to ruin. Transylvania is in great concern, and it is written that last winter, through the marauding bands of the Turk, over 12,000 Christians, young and old, were taken away and sold in the best places of the land of Hungary up to the mining towns, etc.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>It is certain that the Elector has besieged Duke Maurice in Dresden and has taken two strong mines from Ferdinand, namely at Marienberg and Joachimsthal.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Strasbourg is said to have paid homage to the Emperor, yet with great assurance of their will and pleasure; for, as it is said, the Emperor makes friends wherever he can, so that he may subdue the prominent leaders with less delay. But once he achieves the greatest, he will accommodate everyone as much as is convenient and pleasing to him; for the rest, he will take further counsel with promises or force according to the necessity, and it is thought that if God does not particularly intervene, the German nation will be overpowered and ruled by Spaniards and Italians. God grant that France and we do not have to expect the last bath! I fear it will only become too hot for us. Yet it is only about temporal matters; one should not rightly place that before the eternal. God preserve us! Amen.</p>

    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Farewell happily.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, the 5th day of March in the year of our Lord 1547.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Joachim Vadian.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the most illustrious city of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
