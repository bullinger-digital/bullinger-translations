      <p>S. D. You know, most esteemed brother, how great the dissensions are among the Lutherans throughout Saxony, Prussia, Pomerania, and neighboring peoples. Therefore, good men from those regions and from Denmark have repeatedly urged me with prayers to set aside the names of the various teachers, to omit quarrels and insults, and to simply and in a just or methodical order address this matter of justification by faith and works. Above all, they asked me to conceal, so that it may not appear that these writings were made because of these dissensions, but because of the papists, our common enemies. I should also preface it with an apology, which I have prefixed to the most serene King of Denmark.</p>
      <p>I have complied with their requests and have treated this cause quite calmly, I believe. Pray to the Lord that He may bless my labors and establish peace in the churches.</p>
      <p>Since you are among the first whom I love singularly and have always made a participant in my counsels and labors, I am sending this example to you again. I hope it will not displease you or other pious people. At the same time, I ask you to pray to the Lord for me, and to keep me and mine commended to you. Wish all happiness to Mr. Fuchs. My brother's illness progresses almost in its usual manner, although sometimes the pains ease, and sometimes they return. May Jacob Funck, Wittenbach, Mr. Valerius, and all good men be well. Live and farewell eternally. It is a troublesome road, bringing difficult news. Gallus is diligently gathering soldiers in Italy to lift the siege of the sanctuary of St. Florentius in Corsica. Everything in Germany is so disrupted that I almost despair. Zurich, February 5, 1554.</p>

      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, faithful pastor of the church in Biel/Bienne, his esteemed lord and brother.</p>
