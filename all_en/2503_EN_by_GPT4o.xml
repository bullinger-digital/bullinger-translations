      <p>Greetings, most humane Bullinger. I read and reread the letters you sent to us through our Peregrinus, and I was grieved and almost wished that the earth would swallow me up; I took this consultation of our people on the miseries of the church of Locarno so bitterly.</p>
      <p>For with what face, with what mouth, my Bullinger, do we dare to admit the assembly of pious doctors and proven brothers, who will surely accuse us of either treachery or notable negligence, from whose churches such consolations come forth. Although I do not doubt that you have long known what kind of stone we are rolling, more troublesome than Sisyphus's. I want to weep blood. All these things were done without our knowledge; for our people do not easily share their plans with us, indeed they take care that we know nothing (indeed) by which we might pour cold water (as they think) on their plans. I truly fear that I have been more of a prophet to our people than is true, who long ago said: "When Pilate or Herod rides in, Christ must go to the cross; they attack the tree at its lowest point." With the cock admitted, the scoundrels promoted, Christ is exiled among his own, and I do not see milder, but indeed far more cruel plans, and from which I can sufficiently conjecture that our entire country is about to collapse. So far, great scoundrels have been liberated; if one begins to become pious, one must go into misery. Oh, for the faith of God and men. I can write nothing peaceful, since everything at first glance indeed promises peace, but behind it drags a swamp and a collection of all evils. Our people are striving for peace, and would that God would make it firm; I truly see nothing peaceful. It is said: Give peace, O Lord, not: Let us polish an old idol.</p>
      <p>The people of Lendrina see our inconstancy; this will be the first step to expelling Christ from our country by Herod's counsel. The second will be, since things have not turned out as we wished, to bring back the papacy to all of Switzerland. We want peace and no war, and we will make so many little peaces until we have no nails left on our fingers. The advice of your most honorable council pleases us so that we say: We do what we can, because what we want is not allowed. Joseph did not consent to the death of Christ; the Jews did not bear it unpunished that Manasseh was the worst. Woe, that horrific thing Christ threatens to those who close the kingdom of heaven before men and do not enter themselves nor allow those who would enter to do so.</p>
      <p>We are all unworthy. Everything is deplored. Now about the one who is imprisoned for roughly handling the idol of the Theotokos, it seems to me that there was a much freer opportunity for the prophets to inveigh against idolatry than in the peace of the land. The letter of Jeremiah in Baruch will testify; the remaining prophets will almost all testify.</p>
      <p>I fear that our unanimous schism will go to ruin. For it is not enough that we have relegated Christ to exile, to whom the princes ought to have opened the gates, not blocked them, unless we also defile our hands in his blood. You, if there is any counsel, assist the desolate church; for our authority among our people is none, and to the impious dragon, who plots ambushes for the woman fleeing into the wilderness through the waters, throw some hindrance. O my Bullinger, how painfully we bear the fall of our people. May the Lord finally raise them to a heartfelt confession. But enough of this; for I will remain silent, since we can promote nothing at all; so exasperated are the minds of some, so imprudent the others. May that good shepherd be present to his desolate church and lead it into his fold. Amen.</p>
      <p>I return what I received from you, with thanks. That legate, our standard-bearer, is not entirely without sense, he has done more for the peace of the Alpine churches than was entrusted to him.</p>
      <p>Your authority with him will be very strong. I leave the rest to Christ the Savior to be preserved; for so far it is sufficiently deplored.</p>
      <p>We now desire your work on the Apocalypse; for it is uniquely commended by the listeners.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep you safe for his church. You will greet for me Mr. Theodor, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Gwalther, Wolf, Frisius, all the pious. Sebastian Gr√ºbelius, Jacob Rogerius, and others greet you.</p>
      <p>In haste (as the writing itself will testify) Schaffhausen, December 16, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours most devoted in humanity, Simprecht Vogt. To the distinguished man in doctrine, candor, and piety, Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and brother to be respected, in Zurich.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
