      <p>Our messengers, who are riding around the communities, have not come as I expected. The Two Leagues are engaging fiercely, having left 12 men here, who are supposed to insist with ours that the messengers be recalled; if not, they should recall them themselves. Our people are strongly opposing; they sent off a courier with letters last night, urging ours by their oaths not to come, even if they are recalled by the Two Leagues; because they do not have the authority, as the alliance does not concern them, since the messengers here at the meeting do not have orders from their communities. Now you understand the seriousness; the matter has just begun.</p>
      <p>Ours, as I suspect, will also ride from community to community in the other Two Leagues. This may surprise you; but this is the way of this land; if one wants to accomplish something decisive, one must take the matter out of the hands of the big houses. At this hour, the consul gives me letters, ordering me to write down what I think should be sent to you.</p>
      <p>Junker Gugelberg, the magistrate, - in short, now I am pressed by the notary, I cannot do what I want -, he has kept his good speech in Milan, writes how the Savoyard is arming 3000 men, how a large sum of money is lying in Milan, waiting for the Five Places. How the Bishop of Chur was on his way there, a courier came to him and he turned back. This suddenly; the letters contain many other things about Navarro and the Spaniards.</p>
      <p>In Chur, 2 companies of Spaniards are stationed.</p>
      <p>The messenger is in a hurry.</p>
      <p>Petrus Schorsch, a man of great standing among his people, brings letters; encourage him. To the clear and great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
