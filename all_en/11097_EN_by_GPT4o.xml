      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>It pleased the church of Geneva to send the confession of the Eucharist and the clear explanation of the word Adonai, which had already been presented to the visitors Capito and Bucer in Bern, so that it may be apparent what these good and most learned men think about these matters. I hope to be with you in Zurich on the 20th of this month, just after nightfall. The Lord be with you. Bern, 13th of October, the year 1537.</p>
      <p>Megander, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed lords and brothers in the Lord, Bullinger and Leo of Zurich, preachers. Zurich.</p>
