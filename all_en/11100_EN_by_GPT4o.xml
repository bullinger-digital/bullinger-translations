    <p xml:id="regest1">Could not respond immediately when he received Bullinger's letter along with the records of the Bern [Special Synod] on October 9; is very surprised by the fickleness of people. Is glad that Bullinger is taking care of [Johannes] Pontisellas; will send him a Lucian edition and some money after the grape harvest. A Turkish attack on Corfu has failed. Greetings to Leo [Jud] and [Konrad] Pellikan.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ. I received your letter along with the records of the Bern Synod, most learned Heinrich, on Tuesday before Gallus at noon, when all the merchants had already left, so I could not send a reply on the same day. I cannot sufficiently marvel at the fickleness of people: they admit everything at once, however contradictory. I firmly believe that all of us who are now living are unworthy of clear truth; may the most gracious God deign to assist us with His help! You promised to support the young Pontisellas, for which I am very grateful, so that he is not forced to abandon his studies. Here he has no one but his twice-wretched mother. However, I will faithfully fulfill what I promised him; after the grape harvest, I will send him a Lucian edition and some money, as much as I can scrape together. The Turks had invaded Corfu, which is commonly called Corfu, a noble port of the Venetians, and had taken the suburbs, but after driving away many people, they left again. Horrors threaten us from all sides; but they scare us little, so that we may turn away from our sins. Farewell, honest man. From Chur in Rhaetia, October 16, 1537. During the grape harvest.</p>
