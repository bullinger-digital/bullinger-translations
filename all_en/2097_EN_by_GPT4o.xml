      <p>Greetings. I do not usually religiously consider the order in which I write to friends or they to me; I measure it by each one's opportunity and spirit, so that, whether they write first or later, immediately or after an interval, I think it makes no difference. From my occupations and various other troubles that continually arise, I can well imagine that you are not so free in spirit that you can have the leisure to write letters. But enough about this. I have nothing truly new that I think you have not already understood. But so that I do not fail to satisfy you in this matter, I will briefly touch upon both recent and old events: When the Genoese arrived, they ordered some of their men to make incursions into our fortifications, so that from that skirmish and some light battle, they might judge with what spirit our men would receive them. Fortune immediately decided this, with almost all the enemies being slain. I see them still wavering, whether to besiege the towns held by our men or to bring back under their control the inland areas that have defected from them. The Duke of Florence, through some circumlocutions, has passed over to the side of the Genoese; but the matter has become so known that he should rightly be considered an enemy by us. Pietro Strozzi will be for the King in Siena. How much his faction prevails in Florence and what can be inferred from it, you can better judge for yourself. You have heard that the Pope has fallen into a very serious illness; although he seems to have recovered a little, there are still some clear signs of his failing health, so that they do not hope he will live long. The Turk ordered the throat of his son Mustafa to be strangled with a cord and his grandsons, Mustafa's children, to be killed by dashing their bodies against a wall. The reports about peace in Hungary, which you wrote had been sent to you, are false; he has given no hope of even a truce unless Transylvania is restored, where new disturbances arise daily. The Persian seeks peace, and what was sought in that expedition has been accomplished. Some princes of Germany indeed raise their heads and pretend to be planning something great by sending embassies back and forth to France; but, as Cato used to say, they move like shadows. Duke Augustus and the Margrave have their envoys in Vienna. The Emperor has completely lost the hope he had promised himself from the alliance with the English; I see that war will be waged in the early spring. Financial matters delay; but all machines will be employed so that the course of such a pious undertaking is not impeded. I know you have understood what is happening here from others.</p>
      <p>My secretary has not yet returned; therefore, I have nothing to write to Mr. Vererius.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me. Chur, December 2nd. Your Johannes Fraxineus, Bishop of Bayonne.</p>
      <p>May it be well with the hands of Jakob Sturm; I loved him greatly and afterwards did not so much hate as despise him. They have taken Vercelli as Rebulus did the consulship. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, dearest friend. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
