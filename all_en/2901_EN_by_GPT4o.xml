      <p>Hello, brother. I received your letters along with the books, which you had sent long before. I will ensure that the prince receives his, and perhaps I will give it myself, I solemnly promise. I thank you for those you sent to me. I am sending the Actions of the Secretary and the Catalogue of Heretics, in which, unlike in another, your name is not omitted and most deservedly; you will soon see my annotations on it. The execution of the Archbishop of Canterbury gave me the occasion for another book; he was certainly worthy of being written about. My Elector Palatine invited Martyr to teach in Heidelberg. My nephew Ludwig is alive. The school here is beginning to thrive. If you heard what I hear about those three who attacked Westphalus; the conflict has completely flared up again, with inflamed spirits. I do not approve of what our Trinitarian does, especially in that he is so slippery and does not allow himself to be grasped; for now, now this. You wisely advise me to be cautious; I will be cautious, now that I have recognized the disease previously unknown to me; I say again that I do not approve at all, indeed I abhor it with all my heart and I wish you would be my witness sometime (if necessary) that I favored him as long as I was unaware of his nature, and ceased to favor him once I knew the man better. I am tormented by the fact that such doctrines are being introduced into the Kingdom of Poland, which was to be nourished with the purest milk at least in these beginnings. Alas, is there such innate arrogance in anyone, that, disregarding the judgments of the good churches, he would want to publish such poisons. I know he does not reside in Z端rich, I know the book was not printed by you, and you have also condemned it. But it seemed to me that your church ought to do something more, namely to warn the neighboring and allied church not to allow such plagues to spread further from it. But act as you please, and whether by this or another way, ensure that no one is infected; as Brentius often says, the book is indeed bad.</p>
      <p>A day has been set for the assembly, namely the first of June; the king will be present, the princes will be present. Whatever rumors may spread, I do not fear war from the Antichrist nor from the Emperor, much less from the French. I know they will not attack this province by attempting war on Germany. The princes will also live in peace among themselves (as far as can be seen so far). It would remain for us to be diligent and united, and then we would soon completely overthrow the tyranny of the Antichrist. I would like to converse with you longer in writing; but there is no leisure now, and Edward the Englishman is about to depart. Farewell and be well. Greet for me the whole family and all the brothers, and help me with your prayers.</p>
      <p>T端bingen, April 27, 1556.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>Brother, as much as I can, I commend to you the bundle for the king's envoy, that is, to ensure it is given to the host at the Stork, but with great commendation, I beg and beseech you.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Z端rich, honorable brother. In Z端rich.</p>
