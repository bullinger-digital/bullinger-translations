      <p>The inquisitor himself dared last winter to seize my nephew, Mr. Johann Anton von Piro, who was conducting his business in Bologna, and kept him captured and bound for several months, despite him being innocent, as he neither said nor did anything in that city against the decrees of the pope. In those chains, besides the very harsh treatment he suffered from those most impure Dominicans, he incurred a loss of two thousand three hundred crowns:</p>
      <p>... besides what is commonly said about the soldier sent by the pope to France.</p>
      <p>In Chiavenna, on the 6th of June, 1569.</p>
