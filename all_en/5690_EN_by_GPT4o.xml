      <p>As soon as the end of our tragedy was somehow reached, most reverend father, do not be surprised that I did not immediately write to you about what it was like.</p>
      <p>For since I had long ago decided in my mind that at this time, whether our disagreement was resolved or not, I would go to these baths, and from there to you, then to my wife's homeland, both for the sake of health and to restore my rather troubled spirit, I preferred to explain the whole matter to you in person rather than by letter.</p>
      <p>Which I will accomplish when I come to you (I will come, God willing, within 10 or 12 days).</p>
      <p>Now, just take the conclusion: The controversial doctrine was neither judged (for the mediators explicitly said they did not come to judge the doctrine, for this is the duty of some synod), nor was it resolved (for how can contradictions be reconciled?), yet a certain reconciliation of minds was made, with injuries and insults forgiven on both sides: then there was agreement on a certain formula of doctrine, both concerning the Lord's Supper and predestination, to prevent such disputes from occurring in the future, agreed upon by others simply, but by me with protestation and cautious subscription.</p>
      <p>In summary: everything was aimed at removing the scandal, which was not small in the city due to this disagreement, in some way, to consult public peace, to restore the school to its full state, and indeed also to preserve the ministry in its dignity among the people, albeit with some errors covered up.</p>
      <p>The rest in person.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Baden, April 16, 1563.</p>
