      <p> Greetings. Although I scarcely have enough strength in my hands to write to you, as I am entirely covered with pustules erupting from washing, I did not want to send this without my words to you, so that you may see I have more will than ability. Yesterday, I received your letter dated May 3rd, in which you first write about Erasmus Fabritius, who is lying ill here. I sent him a letter from his mother, inquiring at the same time about his health, which I understand is not too bad. He promised to write to his mother himself; but if I see any necessity arise, I will not fail to assist him even with money, which I would like you to promise his mother on my behalf. </p>
      <p> Today, I received a very lengthy letter from Mr. Jacob Zorn, formerly the pastor of Regenstorf; he also wishes to be promoted among our people here, claiming some reasons for his rejection, which I do not trust much unless I first learn from you how his affairs stand; for they are unknown to me. Therefore, you can inform me; until then, I will not respond to him, until I know from you what kind of person he is or what should be believed about him. </p>
      <p> My lords, both Schultheiß Nägeli and Treasurer Haller, have gone to Solothurn, but only to give a negative answer. Yesterday, Fenner in the Hag told me that Uri is not there; they want to completely reject it, also insisting to other places that they do not get involved; in Valais, five of the ten districts have also rejected it, only two have agreed. The Count of Gruyères has also forbidden his people under penalty of beheading, so that no one thinks of it; however, those from Saanen have some delegation to Solothurn. In France, Viret writes to me, the persecution rages beyond measure; there is no end. Bucer and Fagius are in England. That's all for now. May God be with you and all yours; they greet you from me and all my people. Fenner in the Hag greets you back. </p>
      <p> Bern, May 13, 1549. </p>
      <p> Yours, whom you know. </p>
      <p> To the most faithful servant of our Lord Jesus Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his esteemed lord. In Zurich. </p>
