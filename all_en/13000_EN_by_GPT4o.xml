    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] What is happening in Augsburg can be thoroughly recounted by the esteemed colleague Thoman Ruman, who has rightfully earned the goodwill of the people of Augsburg, upon his return.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Musculus wished to be released in these calamitous times in the same manner, but he is forced to endure in Augsburg, which is dangerous not only for him but also for the rest of the family. The unsettled situation, the desecration of piety, and the daily blasphemies that he hears and must endure cause him unspeakable heartache.</p>

    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The Emperor is expected within the next two days. If only no harm comes to the Church because of it! Germany is being urged towards improvement by the rod of the Lord.

    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] In light of the events in Germany, Bullinger should consider what awaits the Swiss Confederates and accordingly call for repentance.

      <p>Greetings. What is happening here in Augsburg, dearest Bullinger, can be thoroughly recounted by our beloved brother and colleague in the Lord, Johannes Rumann, who is now returning to you with the goodwill of our people, which he rightfully requested and obtained.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I wish that I could be given the opportunity to request and the goodwill of our people to obtain a release in these calamitous times; but I am forced to remain here, not only with danger to myself and my family, but also with incredible torment of my heart due to the disturbance of all things and the desecration of true piety and the blasphemies of the malevolent, which we are compelled to hear and endure daily.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Haller, fearing a stumbling block for the church, intends to remain for a while, until he is either recalled by you or receives some other sufficient reason to leave.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>The arrival of the Emperor is expected within two days, and I hope he brings no harm to our church! Germany is being urged by the Lord's scourge to repentance. If only we would recognize the hand of the one who strikes and threatens more severely. But I fear that we will remain in our usual obstinacy.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Consider there what also awaits your people by our example, and turn yourselves entirely to the preaching of repentance. We here hardly dare to whisper. Please, diligently commend us to the prayers of your church. Augsburg, July 14, 1547. Entirely yours, W. M., whom you know.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Greetings in my words to Rudolf Gwalther and all the other brothers.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, a lord and brother in Christ, much to be honored and loved.</p>
