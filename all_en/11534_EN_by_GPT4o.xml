There is a rumor that Emperor [Charles V] wants to have his brother Ferdinand appointed as his successor. In Regensburg, there is a famine, with some believing that it was deliberately brought about to expedite the negotiations; furthermore, some think that the Imperial Diet of Regensburg will be moved to Augsburg. The Imperial Estates are being urged to provide aid against the Turks to [King] Ferdinand; if this is approved before the religious question is settled, the Protestants have labored in vain, even if it is true that Pope Paul [III] has been invited to the Imperial Diet by the Emperor; nothing more precise can be learned about these rumors, it is only certain that Hungary is strongly threatened by the Turks. Greetings and a request to return the copies.</p>

      <p>Greetings. A friend from the town of Leipzig recently sent me copies of the letters of safe conduct, which Emperor Charles V issued in the name of our Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave of Hesse, as well as the suspension of the execution of the ban against the two imperial cities, which I have taken care to send to you, so that you are not unaware of this seemingly unobjectionable matter. If only the cause of religion were to be handled under such fair conditions as those friendly ones invite, who wish for the true religion to be preserved for us. Meanwhile, there is a rumor that he is making great efforts to appoint his brother Ferdinand as his successor, which is thought to be very difficult to achieve. The cost of living in Regensburg is so high that the envoys of some cities have sent back their horses to make the expenses more bearable. Therefore, some say that the Imperial Diet will be moved to Augsburg, as this city has a very ready and transportable supply, which Regensburg lacks for many reasons. Some believe that the high cost of living was deliberately allowed, so that the Emperor can sooner dissolve the Diet. His sole aim is for the Estates to provide aid to Ferdinand against the Turks. If this were granted before the religious matter is settled, there is no doubt that our efforts would be in vain, even if it is true that Pope Paul III has been specifically invited to the Diet by the Emperor. But we have no certainty about these rumors, except that it is certain that the Turks are posing a severe threat to Hungary. Farewell and please return the copies when possible.</p>
      <p>Very quickly. St. Gallen, on the fourth day of April, in the year 1541.</p>
      <p>Your Vadianus.</p>
