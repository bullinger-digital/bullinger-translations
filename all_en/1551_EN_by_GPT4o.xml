      <p>God's grace beforehand. The bearer of this letter, Master Johannes Thomas Hausinger, a native of Strasbourg and citizen of Magdeburg, is an envoy from those of Magdeburg to the evangelical cities in a confederation, as his credentials and letter indicate. He requests 1. a loan of several thousand guilders, as they are in a bad situation, 2. also a contribution from the common citizens, so that they can recover and resume their trade and crafts.</p>
      <p>He was first in Basel, found goodwill, but regarding the loan, the matter was postponed to the assembly of the four cities of Zürich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen; in other respects, he was promised to act according to ability and to prepare the money for the next fair in Frankfurt. The decision was also made here. Be aware, they will not be able to lend much; but everyone is willing to give an honorable contribution. Here, too, special persons, from all guilds and societies, will collect contributions for the comfort and benefit of the poor people.</p>
      <p>Basel also gave the messenger 20 guilders, my lords 20 crowns for his expenses and sustenance, and something for the servant as well.</p>
      <p>Now he comes to you, also has a letter to the honorable council in Zürich; do your best for him, as I know you are inclined to do. I have only wanted to inform you of good intentions, what he has achieved here, in case it might be useful to you there. Besides, his request is that the four cities, now coming together, also write to the other confederates who have the gospel, to see if they might also contribute and help. He has no credentials beyond the foremost cities of the confederation. My lords here, I think, will recommend him to their messenger; I am also asked to write to you, so that it would also be entrusted to your messenger. That is all. What else there is, you will be informed by him personally. Our schoolmaster, Master Benedictus, knows him well otherwise, having studied with him. Theobaldus Nigri from Strasbourg also writes to Musculus on his behalf, as do all the brothers from Basel to us in general, so that there can be no deceit in this matter. I ask you to speak with him, if perhaps the Dutch churches unjustly condemn us, which the Magdeburgers have also used in their writings. I have also spoken with him and hope that if they feel our love and friendship, it will bring good. What else is new, he will also inform you. There are various rumors; some say Maurice is French, some imperial. The emperor is said to have assured him (thus it has come from the emperor's court): if he does not act rightly, he will release the bear (i.e., captured John Frederick) and make his case well. The pope has sent a legate to France to negotiate the income of benefices, which has been reserved for the pope for a time; he was received in Paris with great triumph and pomp, but achieved nothing with the king, receiving such an answer: if the pope removes his camp from Mirandola, dismisses his troops, and also persuades the emperor to dismiss his troops and cease all armament, then he will allow the benefices to follow, otherwise not. The legate nevertheless brought 30,000 francs from there. Otherwise, I have nothing special from France, except that the German merchants and students all have to leave; they are passing through here daily in droves.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the king still burns the believers. Today, however, someone is here before the council for a letter of protection concerning his brother, who is imprisoned, and another brother was previously burned for the sake of the gospel, because my lords' letter of protection came too late.</p>
      <p>We have dealt with Dr. Caspar, whom you recommended to us, as best we could; he is an intimate advisor to Archduke Maximilian and well known to our Mecardo; he openly communicated with the Augsburg church at the last diet, a very distinguished and prudent man. He asserted that the collection of soldiers in Thuringia is not against the emperor, but for the emperor.</p>
      <p>For the Acts of the Council, I thank you greatly. I will send them to Geneva as soon as I can, as you instructed, and I will advise Calvin to prepare a proper antidote against this poison. As for Jerome, who was captured in Geneva, he came here and secretly met with our council, thanking us for the intercession made with the Genevans, asserting that it benefited him greatly, and asking at the same time to be allowed to act under the authority of our lords, promising at the same time everything that contributes to peace and tranquility. This was granted to him under the condition of tranquility. However, as I understood, he left here without greeting anyone, leaving behind letters with the prothonotary that were given to him by the council. He did not meet with any of us, nor did any of us know he was here until he had already left after handling his affairs. I suspect he has gone to you. I wanted to inform you of this, so that if these letters find him with you, you may observe the man more diligently. Certainly, our French province is very troubled, and many complaints reach us. May the Lord calm all these things.</p>
      <p>This is what I had to say, which I ask you to consider kindly. All of ours greet you, as does my family. Greet yours from me, and all the lords and brothers. Tell Otto, please, that I could not find copies of the Antidote for the Tridentine sessions here.</p>
      <p>Calvin's. I wrote to Lausanne, but it is not there either. Viret wrote to Geneva and, as I hope, will send it to me soon: I will send it to him afterwards. Farewell in the Lord Jesus, who may keep and preserve you forever. Amen.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 30, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>This good man also wishes to be recommended to the people of Schaffhausen through you.</p>
