      <p>The Lord Jesus Christ, the only savior of the world, bless you, most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>Christian charity is always solicitous, even when there is no need, just as I do not think there is need now for my admonition, which nevertheless I present to you at this time and continue to urge you, most noble man, to persevere in the true orthodox and catholic faith and to reject and, as much as you can, suppress the doctrine spread against this faith.</p>
      <p>Nor do I think there is a need to recount at length what is the true, solid, and sincere doctrine about the unity of God and the worship of the Trinity and the coeternal Son of God the Father.</p>
      <p>There are illustrious testimonies of divine scripture about these things, from which were composed more than twelve hundred years ago the creeds called the Apostles', Nicene, Athanasian, and Constantinopolitan.</p>
      <p>But now certain petty and ill-disposed men arise, indeed men of depraved and corrupt faith, who do not hesitate to drag all these into quarrels and to cast them into doubt.</p>
      <p>For they alone seem to themselves to be wiser than all others and dare to call it sophistry and papal corruption, which is certainly known to have been handed down from the scriptures before anyone had heard a word about the Roman pope and his antichristian corruption.</p>
      <p>We hear with sorrow that due to the rash and impious importunity of these men, the Polish churches, torn by dissensions, are less successfully able to resist otherwise strong adversaries, that the simpler ones are gravely offended, and that the adversaries finally have something to reproach us with, and the course of the gospel is hindered, the glory of God is obscured, and the salvation of the people is endangered.</p>
      <p>Therefore, your piety sees, and other prudent and pious men see, what needs to be done, that these things can no longer be ignored, but all good men must uniquely intend with united forces that these men are not allowed to proceed and disturb the churches and teach against the truth handed down in the scriptures and creeds.</p>
      <p>The distinguished man, Mr. Christ.</p>
      <p>T[h]retius, a pious and learned man, has written some brief writings on this matter, more sketched than written, which he will not disdain to share with pious men.</p>
      <p>We commend him to your piety as an orthodox man, and we also commend the studious young man, pious and learned Laurentius Zemlinus, the most faithful tutor of the noble children of the most noble man, Mr. Stanislaus Cikouski.</p>
      <p>We have the best hopes for these persons as someday most useful in the church.</p>
      <p>I ask your excellent piety, most excellent man, to consider this brief admonition of mine, which indeed proceeds from the best intention, favorably.</p>
      <p>If ever I can serve your piety in any way, I will always show myself most ready to you.</p>
      <p>May the Lord Jesus keep you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 3, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, Minister of the Church of Zurich, etc.</p>
      <p>To the magnificent lord, Mr. Stanislaus Myszkowski of Mirow, captain of Malbork, my most esteemed lord.</p>
