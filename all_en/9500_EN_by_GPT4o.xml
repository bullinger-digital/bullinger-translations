      <p>Greetings. I am indeed so distracted that I can hardly manage this.</p>
      <p>What I have received from elsewhere, I have included here; let it be trusted by you. I communicate to you what I receive and as I receive it; whether everything is as it seems, let it be. There is fear of an impending war because of Speyer and Worms; but this matter is written to me so covertly and obscurely that I cannot reveal anything certain and clear. It is said that the King of Poland is turning back from his journey to France, because the Pope promises a great amount of gold if he does not go to Poland, and because the king is said to be suffering from a serious and deadly illness, not without suspicion of poison. The situation is complex; but God will overcome all these things. Nor do I write these things as certainties, but I narrate what has been told. I experience daily that there is the utmost freedom to lie. Several good men among us, suddenly and with a deadly illness of the head, have departed to the Lord, and some are still bedridden.</p>
      <p>Indeed, I am now called to Mr. Johann MÃ¼ller, a senator, who is said to be at the point of death.</p>
      <p>I therefore break off this writing, which I have hastily and therefore very poorly drafted.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all our friends and your family. Zurich, 20th November 1573.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear lord and good friend Mr. Tobias Egli, pastor at St. Martin in Chur.</p>
