    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] The news is currently so contradictory that Blarer is very reluctant to write. He can hardly listen to it anymore.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Now the Augsburg envoys [from the imperial camp] report that there is still no peace agreement between Emperor Charles V and Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony! The Elector (who is being watched by a Spanish military judge in an open tent) has been given a red hat. The Elector shows bravery. He does not want to cede either the electoral dignity or his most important fortresses. The young Johann Friedrich II the Middle of Saxony and his allies are armed in Wittenberg. Landgrave Philip of Hesse, Count Albrecht of Mansfeld, and Wilhelm of Thumshirn are said to have united their armies. It will still get rough!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] It is confirmed that the Ravensburg envoys wrote to their authorities from Nuremberg: They could not reach the Emperor because the roads were blocked.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Friends from Ulm and Augsburg indicate that the Emperor plans to send cavalry and foot soldiers against Konstanz. He has demanded hundreds of horses from the Hegau [knighthood]. The advance is intended to test the reaction of the Confederates. If they were to rush to the aid of the people of Konstanz, he would have a good reason to attack and subjugate them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] In Venice, news arrived from Constantinople, which was conveyed to Augsburg by public post with a letter dated May 23. Sultan Suleiman is preparing a large army, which will soon set out [against the empire] without him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] This note should be given to [Thomas Blarer or Konrad Zwick] for Bullinger in Zurich by the Augustinian [...]. Blarer cannot write to him now.</p>

      <p>I can hardly write any news right now - things are being reported so incredibly contradictorily! It seems as if I have heard nothing at all.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Now the envoys from Augsburg report that their representatives have written that the Elector is still not reconciled; he is being watched in an open tent by a Spanish military judge. They have put a red hat on him. Everyone can see him, but he is very brave. He does not want to accept what is being demanded of him, that he should cede the electoral dignity and hand over the best fortresses to the Emperor, etc. Also, the young Elector and those with him in Wittenberg are very brave. They do not want to surrender. It is also said that the Landgrave and Count Albrecht of Mansfeld and Wilhelm of Thumshirn have come together with their troops. And it is believed that things will still get rough.</p>

    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The envoys from Ravensburg wrote back to their lords from Nuremberg. They could not get any further and could not reach the Emperor because the Saxons have blocked the passes and roads everywhere so that no one can come to or from the Emperor. It is certain that those from Ravensburg have been written to by their own, whom they sent to the Emperor. I do not know how things will turn out.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Warnings are coming from Ulm and Augsburg from good people who wish us well, that the Emperor intends to send some cavalry up here with some companies of foot soldiers. He has also demanded that the Hegauers equip several hundred horses, etc. And it is generally believed that he wants to provoke Konstanz and see whether the Confederates will take them in or not. For if they take them in, he will have a good pretext to attack them and will then also undertake to subjugate them.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>From Constantinople to Venice and from there to Augsburg, it was written by post on May 23 that the Turk is finally preparing to march with a great army, although not in person for several important reasons.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Give this note to the Augustinian as well, so that he can take it with him to Zurich and hand it over to Bullinger, because I am so overwhelmed that I cannot write him a single word right now.</p>
