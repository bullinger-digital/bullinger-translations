      <p>S. P. D. Favorable lord and brother.</p>
      <p>I have understood and received your letter with joy, in which I always feel the love and friendship you have for me, for which I thank you most highly, etc. Furthermore, favorable lord and brother, I have understood from your letter how my supplication to my lords of Zurich has been heard by the mayor and the councilors, etc. Consequently, it has been decided to entrust the matter to four men from the council, who shall deliberate on how to help me in the most discreet manner possible, so that no disadvantage arises for me. This opinion has also been written to me by my godfather and brother M. Werner Steiner, etc.</p>
      <p>Upon such writing and action, I have thought to myself: Well then, nothing remains hidden; should something be arranged to be given to me and done secretly, and it comes out over time, it would bring me more harm and disadvantage against my lords than if it were done with their knowledge, considering that my lords have also dealt with the matter and claim (demand) at the days in Baden, as well as through their embassy before the mayor and councilors, etc. And to prevent any slander and not to hinder me from steadfastly holding and proceeding in my office, I have taken the matter into my own hands and have gone to Zug and have shown my supplication, as I have sent it to you and my lords of Zurich, to my lord bailiff, the governor along with the other councilors, and asked them if there was anything in the supplication that they found objectionable, they should inform me of the same, I would change it (although I sent my supplication to you before and before I showed it to my lords of Zug, as it was then heard before the mayor and the councilors); they have recognized my supplication as just, appropriate, and well-placed and have found no objection to it.</p>
      <p>I have told Master Haben in Zug about this matter in troubled days, what caused me to do so, only that it seemed better and more appropriate to me to show such to my lords themselves, rather than that they should learn of it otherwise; it would bring me less disadvantage, etc. Which Master Haben has approved, and advised me hereupon: since I have shown all dealings to my lords of Zug, I should ask them for a recommendation (letter of recommendation) to the mayor and councilors (of); it would not harm me, but rather promote. I have followed this and asked my lords for a recommendation, which has been willingly granted to me, as is found with the recommendation. Hereupon is my friendly request, you should further do the best and handle the matter as you think most appropriate; for I give you all authority herein to act according to your pleasure, etc.</p>
      <p>Tell M. Werner Steiner, he should not worry about the 3 crowns for the window; my lord bailiff To√ü will settle it for him.</p>
      <p>With this, entrusted to God. Greet our brothers for me. With this, entrusted to God.</p>
      <p>To the worthy, well-learned, and highly esteemed M. H. Bullinger, servant of the gospel of the church of Zurich, his especially trusted and beloved.</p>
