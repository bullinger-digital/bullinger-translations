      <p>To my gracious dear lord and father, there has been some tension between our gracious lords of the Seven Cantons of the Confederates and some of our citizens here in Chur, concerning a tithe that the Abbot of Pfäfers claims here in Chur. Our citizens believe they owe nothing to the abbot, for reasons explained in the attached document. Since our gracious lords of Zurich are primarily driving this matter and Lord Spross has expressed himself sharply at the last held assembly, some good-hearted people are quite concerned. They believe that if the honorable council of the city of Zurich were better informed about the matter and understood where it leads, they would act somewhat differently. Therefore, my lord Tscharner, the mayor, has secretly and confidentially revealed the entire matter to me and has made me sufficiently aware that the city of Chur is not concerned with the tithe, but with something much greater. The clergy openly indicate that if the abbot is granted his tithe, they intend to seek the same treatment from the Confederates or, if they do not find support there, to reclaim their outstanding tithes with the help of their fellow believers in the Five Cantons. If this happens, as the clergy have been working on it for years, the foundation, which is in decline, could be revived, which would result in significant harm to the entire church. My lord Tscharner has therefore asked me to write to you, my lord and father, in complete secrecy, and to request that you inform some good-hearted members of the council and also admonish them to act more mildly in this matter, considering the aforementioned reasons. And so that you can better counter some objections, he has entrusted me with this attached document and has also instructed me to write that our citizens, who are concerned with this matter, are willing, if they can find the council's advice, to inform the honorable council of the city of Zurich, in the hope that they, their dear confederates and allies, and faithful fathers of the city of Zurich, will act paternally and at least give them faithful paternal advice, not opposing them. Therefore, my lord mayor again asks you: if you find that these arguments are useful, to kindly request the honorable council of your city of Zurich, you should not hide this from him, but write to me in secret; you can be sure that you will never be betrayed. He expects nothing else from you than that you let me know if you think it necessary to inform the honorable council of the city of Zurich in writing according to the content of the document; his request to you is also that you keep this document in your hands. This is the summary of the mandate. Therefore, I have taken the liberty to write to you, my lord and father, so that our gracious lords of Zurich may be better served by this tithe. However, since it is solely a matter of the clergy and I perceive that significant harm may arise to our church from this, I believe I am obliged and duty-bound before God, in my office, to advise and help to the best of my ability, so that the kingdom of the devil is destroyed and God's kingdom is opened. Now, in our Five Cantons, there is such a situation that this bishopric here in Chur cannot be better overthrown than by withholding the income, a large part of which the city of Chur has taken into its hands. For if the canonries were not so completely abolished, the families would have sent their children there as in the past and helped to maintain the bishopric, which they now do not care much about because the income is too small. And so that you understand it fundamentally, the God's House Canton has eleven courts, among which the city of Chur is no more than one court, but the foremost; some of the courts are still papist, and the bishopric will be divided into eleven parts.</p>
      <p>Therefore, there is not much hope here that the schools and church can be maintained; one must now only seek ways to overthrow it. But if the Abbot of Pfäfers maintains the matter, it is to be feared that the remaining papist courts will seek and find help and advice from the Five Cantons or also from their fellow believers in the Five Cantons to restore the God's House, that is, the bishop, which has been torn away, although they have not understood to seek it from us according to our land rights until now.</p>
      <p>For they claim that they are not obliged to give the tithes for which they have no letter and seal, which is why for 30 whole years no tithe has been given to the Abbot of Pfäfers. But if he were to maintain this, the remaining clergy would have a handle; for they also publicly rejoice and say that the city of Zurich is most actively striving and working in this matter (as it is true). They also threaten: if these citizens of the city of Chur lose the tithe, they will bring the whole city to its feet.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I truly think it is necessary to speak best to the matter; for one must not imitate what a city of Zurich concedes to the clergy. God have mercy, that they have so well nested in Zurich. Therefore, one should not help them to become more powerful elsewhere.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my request is also on behalf of the church, that you inform some of our gracious lords of all the matters in detail. I have no doubt: if they understand fundamentally where the matter leads, they will let the honor of God be of concern to them above all things.</p>
      <p>This I have written to you, my gracious lord and father, in great haste, for which you must forgive me; for I intended to write only after eight days. But as we have been informed that no one is traveling from here, we feared the matter would be delayed too long, which is why I did not want to delay writing etc.</p>
      <p>I have also written something about the matter to Lord Rudolf Gwalter. Therefore, you can well communicate this to him and inform him of all the matters, so that if you do not have so much time, he can relieve you of some burden. With this, I commend you to God the Lord; may He keep you and your entire people in long-lasting health. Amen.</p>
      <p>Chur, January 17, 1558.</p>
      <p>Johannes Fabricius, your most observant.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly and well-learned lord, Lord Bullinger, pastor of the church of Zurich at the Great Minster, his gracious lord and father, to respond. Zurich.</p>
