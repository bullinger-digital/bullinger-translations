      <p>Greetings. As I was about to seal the letters addressed to you around 2 o'clock in the afternoon, behold, the man from Locarno is here and offers me your latest along with the decrees of the 6th session and the speech of Lotteringen, which I am returning because I had previously received it in print.</p>
      <p>And I give you my greatest thanks.</p>
      <p>Work for the 7th session, so that we may see what the disorderly men have ordained about order.</p>
      <p>The things they have decreed about the mass are most ridiculous; a lid worthy of the pot.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
