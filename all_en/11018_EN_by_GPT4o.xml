    <p xml:id="regest1">The University of Basel is surprised that [Johannes] Fries is to be hindered from continuing his legal studies by being appointed to the teaching service, and asks Bullinger to persuade the Zurich council to change its mind, as Zurich could also benefit from it in the future. Furthermore, Basel urgently relies on him for the development of the newly founded Pedagogium, of which Fries is the head.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Our university is surprised that some people there do not support good and honest talents in such a way that, after they have already overcome the harder and more difficult parts and have now begun to pass through the pleasant ones, they attempt to stop them from advancing, as if they do not favor literature or the learned, so that they may not enjoy a healthier pleasure. Fries has already progressed to the point where he can acquire what is lacking without effort and with great delight, and if he wishes to attempt something new, he can quickly go through it with great benefit both to himself and to his country. Meanwhile, they want to drag him back to the grindstone, where he will partly lose and partly wear away what he has so far acquired of good disciplines, not to the great benefit of the students. I remain silent about the fact that in the meantime, through the labors of the alphabet and the most harmful tedium, he will lose his talent, harm his memory, and prepare a life of ill health. Moreover, it will be entirely cut off that he cannot accomplish what he had set his mind on, indeed not even begin it. From this, your republic will lack no small benefit. It is certain that in these times, the prudence of civil law is so beneficial to cities that theology has no closer ally. For what theology teaches according to the will of God, civil law pursues and thus not a little helps to make the appearance of the church at least better and more beautiful, and we are less compelled to hear evil because the gospel has not been so well preserved until now. You know how much authority one can gain and how much benefit one can bring to the people by using that prudence rightly among those who have nothing but perhaps some plebiscites and counsels taken on the spur of the moment, especially if he applies divine wisdom to it. We have heard that Fries is entirely devoted to this, so that whatever time he can obtain, he will devote to the laws, after he has enough of the arts and philosophy and, as much as is appropriate for living well, of sacred doctrine, although he will not otherwise cease from this, as much as is permissible for the necessary study of civil law. Thus, wise and learned men among us feel that you, above all, should, for your prudence, especially while others neglect it, consider and persuade the senate how advantageous it would be for the republic if Fries were to remain in Basel for a few more years, but not otherwise than that he could return to his own more learned and useful and repay much more happily whatever benefits they have ever conferred. There are those to whom this task could be entrusted no less usefully than to Fries. For I do not know if there is any city today that overflows equally with learned young men. And they know how to teach, as those to whom the duty of teaching has been partly entrusted until now. Moreover, they are bound to wives, for which reason that scholastic labor will be more justly imposed on them than on a free man. There is no need for me to point out this or that person to you with a finger. Make a selection; for there is, as you are able, a multitude. You will find those through whom it will happen that Fries will one day return to his country with a great treasure of letters and sacred laws, and with the honor of the gospel as well.</p>
      <p>Moreover, lest I pass over what is among the first for us: You can hardly believe how much his departure would harm the studies of our youth. For the Pedagogium was begun by Mr. Grynaeus together with Amorbach, Oporinus, and the other learned men of our university as the writer. And after Fries was commendably appointed to this, the young men have now become accustomed to his voice, to his language, to his teaching method, so that it cannot be taken away and another substituted, than a master to young horses, who has formed their step for some time and taught them to endure a rider. For with another coming in, everything will be new, from which what else but ruin will follow? Therefore, since Fries can remain here with such great benefit to himself, to our country and our young men, indeed to the whole academy, the senate of our university asks you to persuade them that it would be more useful and praiseworthy if, with their good permission, he were sent back to us, so that he may be able to return to them someday more enriched with many goods and in the meantime lay the foundations of our restored academy in such a way that praise to them, honor and benefit to us, and both to you may finally come abundantly. As for us, if you comply, you will impose nothing that we would not be most ready to bear.</p>
      <p>Farewell always with yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 27, 1537.</p>
      <p>Oswald Myconius by the command of the academy, yours.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant bishop of Zurich, lord and brother in Christ, to be greatly respected by him.</p>
