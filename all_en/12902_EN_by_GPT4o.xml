    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Blarer hopes that Bullinger has received his letter [No. 2849] from last Friday [March 18]. Since then, there have been no news except for the report from an Ulm resident who arrived the previous evening at his brother's house in Konstanz. He reported that in Ulm, the confirmed news of the capture of Leipzig by Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony had arrived. The Elector is also said to have negotiated with the enemy (about what, is unknown).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] The Ulm resident also reported that all the pious people there wish the best for the people of Konstanz and hope that they do not agree to such peace terms as they did, as they would not fare worse without a peace agreement. He further mentioned that there would be an uprising in Ulm if the foreign troops were to withdraw, and the people would strangle those responsible for the situation. However, a strong imperial garrison will likely remain in the city. A new garrison has just replaced the old one and is even worse than the first. Additionally, Emperor Charles V (who is staying in Nördlingen) has let the people of Ulm know that he will soon return.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] On the previous evening, the city clerk of Memmingen [Georg Maurer] arrived for negotiations with Sebastian Schertlin. He reported that three imperial companies are being relocated to the city. The Emperor is said to be recruiting soldiers in the vicinity of Kempten, Biberach, Isny, and Memmingen, but no more than four have gathered! Obviously, people are tired of him and would gladly be rid of him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger should report on Joachim Schwarz [correct: Gachnang, known as Gachlinger], who was a pastor in Wangen [an der Aare] in the Bern region and is known to Bullinger. He is said to be a frivolous and wicked fellow who has fathered an illegitimate child. He now wants to become a pastor in Kempten!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Through the mediation of Hans Vogel [von Altnau], the steward of the Konstanz cathedral chapter, Johannes Gisling was appointed as pastor in [Lang]rickenbach. The local church wardens have approached Blarer and complained about Gisling's youth and lifestyle. He is said to have once received a scholarship in Zurich before studying in Freiburg [i.Br.]. He can play music and often plays for the young people to dance late into the night. If Bullinger knows anything about him, he should report and advise on how to handle the situation. Gisling is a good poet. It would be appropriate if the newly recruited pastors [in Thurgau] were first examined in Zurich and a certificate of conduct was required from there, otherwise things will soon go badly in Thurgau.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Bullinger should pray that the people of Konstanz do not fall into temptation. Greetings, especially to Bullinger's household.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Sebastian Münster in Basel wants to send [Erasmus] Oswald Schreckenfuchs 50 guilders. However, there is no direct, reliable way to deliver it. If a Zurich resident has something to do in Basel, Bullinger should give him the enclosed letter for Münster, and the Zurich resident should bring the money received from Münster back to Zurich, from where Bullinger can send it to Blarer at a good opportunity, who will then ensure it is forwarded to Memmingen. Bullinger should forgive this inconvenience. Schreckenfuchs is such a good man that Blarer is happy to do him this service.</p>

      <p>Dear lord and brother, I wrote to you last Friday. I hope you have received it. Since then, we have heard nothing new except that last night a citizen from Ulm arrived here. He has a brother here. He says that certain news has come to Ulm that Leipzig has been completely captured by the Elector and that something new has been negotiated with the enemy; however, he does not know what. We hope to hear more soon.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>He also says that all the pious people in Ulm always wish well for our city of Konstanz, praying for us, saying: "Oh, may God protect them, may they look to us, and not also come to such a peace where they could fare worse in all unrest." He also says that if all foreign troops were to leave, there would certainly be an uprising, and the common people would kill all those responsible for this matter; but there will always be a strong garrison there. Fresh troops have just arrived, many of the old ones have left, and the current ones are behaving worse than the first. Also, the Emperor, who is still in Nördlingen, has informed them that he will soon be with them again.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The city clerk of Memmingen came last night because Lord Sebastian Schertlin has something to negotiate with him. He says that they now also want to station 3 companies of soldiers in the city. He complains greatly about this. The Emperor has been recruiting in Kempten, Biberach, Isny, Memmingen, etc. He would like to take on many soldiers, but has not been able to gather more than four. He feels the goodwill! In summary: The situation is such that everyone is tired and weary of the Emperor, and they would gladly be rid of him, if they could.</p>

      <p>Dear lord and brother, please inform me what kind of man Joachim Schwarz is. He is said to have been in the Bern area at Wangen and is well known to you. It is said that he is a frivolous and wicked man. He has had a child outside of marriage, etc. He is now in Kempten. He is supposed to be a preacher there!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Also, someone has now come to Rickenbach in Thurgau and become a pastor there (through Hans Vogel, who is the steward or manager of the cathedral chapter). He is supposed to preach the gospel, as God's word has always been preached in Rickenbach until now. The church wardens have been to see me. They say they are burdened by him; he is very young. He calls himself Hans Gyslinger. He is said to have had a scholarship in Zurich and then moved to Freiburg in the papal territory and studied further there. He can play music. And it is said that he makes the young fellows and daughters dance late into the night, etc. If you know anything about him, let me know, and how to deal with him. He is also supposed to be a poet and make carmina. The good pious people do not know how they should deal with him. I think it would be appropriate for someone to have to be examined in Zurich beforehand and bring a certificate of conduct with knowledge of his well-brought-up nature and life. Otherwise, it will soon be a miserable affair in Thurgau!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Oh, pray to God earnestly and with all faithfulness for us, that He does not let us fall into temptation! Greet all people, especially your household. Monday after Laetare.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Also, Münster in Basel is supposed to send Oswald Schreckenfuchs in Memmingen 50 guilders. However, there is no reliable way to have a message from Basel to Memmingen. It is my diligent request that if someone from your area is dealing in Basel, you bind the enclosed letter to Münster, so that he brings the money to you. After that, you could easily send it to me every day, and then I to Memmingen. Please do not be angry that I trouble you with such matters. This Oswald is such a good man that I would gladly serve him with all my heart.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly learned lord Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich, my especially trusted dear lord and brother.</p>
