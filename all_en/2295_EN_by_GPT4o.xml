      <p>The Church of Locarno, which is in Christ, to the most pious and venerable men, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger and the other ministers of the Church of Zürich, grace and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, the only Savior.</p>
      <p>We have no doubt (most learned and faithful interpreters and ministers of the word of God) that our cause concerning religion, which was sent to you in letters a few days ago, is well known to you, and we doubt even less that this cause is dear to your hearts and that you strive with all your might to ensure that the Gospel of Christ is both proclaimed and flourishes among us.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, as we daily hear new rumors and innovations, which our lords of the Seven Angles are plotting, and the terrors with which they disturb our afflicted church, we are often compelled to flee to you, imploring help and assistance. Indeed, we are subject to great disturbances, so much so that there is a danger, due to the horrible terrors, that many of the weaker ones may relapse into papistic heresy.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since we perceive that the Lord offers us no other means besides yours, from which we may hope for tranquility, peace, and consolation in such great miseries and such a sea of distress, we implore help through God's goodness and mercy with our families and children; otherwise, the enemies of Christ will be at hand, deliver us to death, deprive us of our possessions, or send us into cruel exile.</p>
      <p>Wherefore, we beseech you by the mercy of God, most pious men, that, as much as is in you, you may rescue us poor wretches from such a depth of distress and give your efforts so that our church may finally be united under some pastor and receive spiritual nourishment, so that, having abandoned the errors and vices of human flesh, it may obey the spirit, lest such an occasion for slander be continually offered to our adversaries; for they study nothing else but how to speak ill of us and slander us for any trivial reason, although, as much as possible, we do not give them any occasion for slander. Therefore, we are not surprised that it has reached your ears (as has been indicated to us by letters) that we are Anabaptists; for this has originated from no other source than the slanderer himself, that is, the devil, who is entirely intent on preventing the Gospel of Christ from being preached both here and elsewhere.</p>
      <p>God is our witness, together with Christ our Savior and the Holy Spirit, the only God, that none of us favors Anabaptist dreams, but rather each one of us vigorously contradicts and opposes them. We embrace the same doctrines and the same Christian confession as our lords, to whom we flee, imploring help. May it be far from us to adhere to the Catabaptists. Would that one of you were here, who could most thoroughly examine our church; for he would recognize in reality that we are not only not infected with such heresy, but have not even tasted it with the slightest lips. We know indeed and trust that our most illustrious lords will not so easily believe a matter of such importance without some reason, indeed we ask you, if in the future you hear anything bad about us, that you will wish to ascertain the truth. For we are not unaware of how cunning Satan is; who, when he sees that some foundations of the church have already been laid here, fears lest our most illustrious lords should so favor the Gospel that, with all heresy expelled, a Christian church may be built upon it, and his kingdom be overthrown. Concerning these matters, may you deign to make our lords more certain, lest they suspect any evil of us or delay in executing what is necessary for this business. Our enemies perhaps call us Catabaptists because we have baptized our infants at home in the presence of the church in a Christian rite, thinking that they are not baptized because they were not baptized in the papistic manner. But we assert and believe that they are baptized, since they have been baptized according to the Lord's institution. Therefore, dearest brothers, help us in our misery, assist so many Christian women, favor so many poor little children, and make mention of our church in your prayers, we pray. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Locarno, the sixth day before the calends of June, 1554.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and venerable men, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger and the other ministers of the Church of Zürich, our most esteemed. In Zürich.</p>
