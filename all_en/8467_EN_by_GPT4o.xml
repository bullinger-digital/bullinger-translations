      <p>May Christ grant that this year has dawned most happily for you and yours, and may the Lord continue to bless you, increase you with His gifts, and protect you from all evil! For almost a month now, I have not sent you any letters due to various matters that oppress me, and indeed, for your benefit and that of the church, I have been entirely focused on ensuring that my relative and son-in-law, Gwalther, dedicates those six sermons of his to the most honorable council and addresses in the preliminary and dedicatory the matter that is being disputed among you. May Christ grant that this has been done with much fruit!</p>
      <p>I congratulate your church on having been given Capellum; for I hope that through him, it will be well advised, which I also pray to the Lord for. You will greet him and congratulate him. It will become more willing with time and much unwillingness will pass away.</p>
      <p>The presence of a learned man and a pious life will mitigate much. If Ganthner digs a pit, let him see that he does not fall into it himself. You will continue to defend the truth and refute falsehood both in the synod and outside the synod. If my book is still necessary for you, keep it until you have used it abundantly; if you return it after one or two months, it will be soon enough. I send back the episcopal wolfish business. Nothing else can be expected from them. May the Lord overthrow them!</p>
      <p>Whatever you can do for the preservation of the faithful, you will do by assisting with the nobles. May the Lord bless the matter. We must labor and pray as long as we live. I have enclosed a paper containing various news, some of which are written to me and some to Gwalther. Beza has returned safely and unharmed to Geneva from France. Churches are beginning to be restored in France. There will be a general synod there within a short time; Beza is also called there; for the evangelicals will consult among themselves in that synod about the restoration of the churches. Many other things should be written to you; but I am excluded by time. I pray you consider these things favorably, and may you and your household fare well.</p>
      <p>ZÃ¼rich, January 12, 1571.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Greet the councilors, Pontasella, Mr. Gregor, Bonet, etc., and our other friends.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, my honorable and beloved lord and brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
