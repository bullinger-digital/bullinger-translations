      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus. Most illustrious doctor and pastor of the church, I received the news that you have received my letters dated the third of September, and on the 13th of this month, I entered Stuttgart with the illustrious Count Georg entering through another gate. For the reasons I wrote to you, I requested a release and silently expressed the odious cause of schism, the deficiency of my own house, which not only forces me to lose good hours but also endangers my health in winter, and then the effort to rescue my family, which would not so easily come to such a remote place. Lord Vergerius, whom I found there, dissuaded me, as he often did, from doing so, and indeed prudently advised that everything should be done in due time. But the reasons I prescribed to you did not allow for delay. Therefore, I persisted and obtained what was very easy, not only because I was not obligated by a given house, but because the princes themselves (even if they were silent about this) desired me to go; the Montbéliardians, through their advocates and procurators from Dole and counselors from Montbéliard, acted in their interest with me so that I would move to Montbéliard, so that all the acts of the Dole cases would be examined by me before they were completed, as I later learned. But listen to what happened soon after. Returning to Tübingen, I gave the academy the letters from the prince's chancellery about my dismissal, which were opened by them on the same day and read the next day, the 20th of this month, in the general senate of the school, before I had entered it. Upon my entrance, the rector said that a mandate or letters from the chancellor (namely that papist Ambrosius) had come, by which he delegated his duties to Lord Martin Fraech, a licensed professor of theology, since the other professor was absent. When first asked for my opinion, I said that the papal authority should not be used in any way, but rather the authority of the prince and the school; it is better to lose life and everything than to have anything in common with the detected antichrist. While I expected everyone's contradiction, after the older doctor of decrees, who immediately contradicted, I easily repressed the rest, and they all agreed with my opinion; I was filled with great joy and, after the senate ended, I congratulated them and said that if I had known of such a holy reformation, I would not have pursued the dismissal to my great detriment; but I was more joyful that I was leaving not sadly, but happily. To which none of them responded with a word, so much did they desire my departure, that they did not dare even for the sake of honor to say they would intercede with the prince to retain me. Nor did I say this because I regretted the decision; it was entirely in my power to change, and everything was intact, but to explore their minds. When the duke came here the following Saturday, I congratulated him on that reformation of the academy and said that I could now remain in the profession with a good conscience and peace and was still prepared, if he wished. The prince began to speak of a new cause, the instruments of which were in Montbéliard. I understood that he wanted to send me to Montbéliard. On the 14th of this month, in Stuttgart, I spoke honorably of you to both princes, and the duke explained it in German to his father, and both listened kindly; they are not affected by schism, nor would the duke remove anything for the time being, as I fully realized when called by them to Chambach, where I conversed with them for two hours, and the duke praised the piety and doctrine of Lord Peter Toussaint, asking if I knew him. I replied that I had learned of the communion of churches from his letters to Lord Wilhelm Farel and to me while I was in Neuchâtel. He added that it would be expedient for my book on abuse to be made in German and that I would find someone in Montbéliard to do it. I write this gladly so that you may understand that the prince's mind is not alien. Whoever advised me to stay here sought only the benefits of the stipends, at least here they primarily regard them. It was not useless for the church that I came here; it seems to me less useless to move to Montbéliard, even if I am reduced from a whole to a quarter of the stipends, which is more than double what I retain here; but I will scarcely be in Montbéliard for half a year before consultants flock to me, and perhaps there a refuge can be established for pious Frenchmen if the Spanish Inquisition creeps in. Ten days ago, I received letters from Lyon that Matthew Horris had gone to Rome to bring back those bulls. There will be no lack of prompt scribes there, and what I began in the French language against the papacy will soon be reduced to the world and prepared for publication, which I could not do here. I prefer smaller stipends with greater fruit for the Lord's vineyard, although, as I said, they can be increased with legal advice. What if, as I offered to the princes, a school is begun to be established; if I begin to teach, they will flock, so that I will have four times as many listeners as I have here, and they will come not for the sake of vanity or doctoral titles, but for the sake of doctrine. My name is not obliterated in Burgundy, Lorraine, Flanders.</p>
      <p>If it happens, there will not be a school more common and useful to the French and Germans, besides other things that you will understand from previous letters! From these bearers, I learned the reasons, which they can report to you, why I had no response from Casellis. For when I wrote again in July, asking them to request a Frenchman for the family's exit, I offered my services in Marburg; however, with the consent of this prince, who could not refuse, when he replied that he could not give a house. After sending those letters, I yielded to the opportunity of having a house to Lord Vergerius and Dr. Laurentius, and with the matter delayed, I struggled much with the deficiency of buildings. Many (as Vergerius says) will laugh at my actions, but those who either do not know my plans or, if they know, would despise them more, which is the greater part. I am so accustomed to being contrary to the majority. Farewell. I wish to greet Lord Pelican, Lord Bibliander, Lord Zwingli, Lavater, and others. In Tübingen (from where I will no longer write to you) on the 27th of September 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours forever, Charles du Moulin.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned doctor of the church, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
