      <p> Greetings. Having completed the labors of the holidays, I indeed ought to make up for the gap in writing with the frequency of letters; but I hope that the peace agreement is so certain and true that it will greatly reduce the occasion for us to write. May God, the best and greatest, make it so. I received your booklets, most esteemed lord, with great joy and am now reading them and absorbing them into my own understanding. At the same time, some works of Schwenckfeld have been obtained from our bookseller, from the comparison of which I will perceive whatever poison is contained and, as soon as possible, I will safely return them. Trustworthy men report the articles of peace as follows: 1. Religion is free throughout the entire kingdom; 2. Seven illustrious cities have been handed over to the Condé; 3. 18,000 men are to be maintained by the king for the Condé until the king comes of age. The royalists have been driven to this servile condition, especially due to the vigor of Duke Wilhelm of Saxony, who came to the king's aid, but upon discovering the true cause of the war, withdrew and, having made a protestation that he did not wish to be injurious to his profession, advised the king himself to accept the conditions, however they might present themselves, from the Condé. - Nothing certain from Italy. Our Bader is in a hurry. Count Hannibal today, through President Dietägium, is trying to coax the process of the business and the case of Ascanio from our magistrate. </p>
      <p> What he has achieved, I do not yet know; however, he requested in the name of the neighborhood, etc. </p>
      <p> Farewell. </p>
      <p> Quickly from Chur, April 21, 1568. </p>
      <p> All of ours greet you. </p>
      <p> Your most devoted servant, Tobias Egli. </p>
      <p> I will write to Mr. Haller another time; now I could barely steal this time. To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of the Church of Zurich, his most gracious and eternally esteemed lord. Zurich. </p>
