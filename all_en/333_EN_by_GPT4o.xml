      <p>Greetings. I can do nothing more than inform you that your letters, along with those of Gaster, have been delivered to me by our Froschauer. Then pray to the Lord that everything turns out well. Things are going well with us; I am hopeful; the consultation is succeeding; I see unanimity. First, indeed, our eight deputies consulted on the 30th of the previous month and concluded that they want to convene a diet. Today, the Bernese write very friendly letters and request the same, that a diet be convened. Therefore, it is being convened for the four cities in Zürich on the 25th of November, so that a unanimous response can be concluded to be given to the seven cantons. Therefore, the messenger is here. Let us pray to the Lord. This also to Gaster, whom I greet. Constance is three times miserable. The first storm from 100 12 guilders. Farewell. Pray that we may be preserved in the truth of Christ and peace. Musculus is with us, my neighbor.</p>
      <p>In Zürich, very hastily, 7th of November 1548.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Oswald Myconius, his dearest brother.</p>
