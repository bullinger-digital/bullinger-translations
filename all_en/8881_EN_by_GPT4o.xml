      <p>Greetings. As the noble young man Hohesaxio, our fellow and old friend, writes to you, I certainly did not want to miss the opportunity to greet you; for as I hold you in high regard, I also love you, men who have served the Christian republic excellently and are most loving of concord, even though I had asked Hohesaxio to write and include my greetings in my name as well. I came here to Wittenberg last year with the son of the Voivode of Władysław, one of those whom your son-in-law mentioned in his book about the eternal son of God. We have enjoyed great prosperity so far, a benefit we owe solely to God, although we saw that Pharaoh in Brussels up close. In our Poland, God is showing His wrath through the high price of grain, various diseases, and pestilence. The same God had sent more than a hundred thousand Tartars into Russia; and in His mercy towards His own, He drove them back again, afflicted by pestilence and fear instilled by our people, who awaited them armed at the borders.</p>
      <p>It is reported that the Turk has occupied Wallachia, having sent his Pasha there, while the Voivode himself, a prince 18 years old, seeks a wife in Russia. We now have a not good neighbor, with whom we will undoubtedly have to fight soon. But who can successfully contend with this beast, says John in the Apocalypse. Indeed, as in the past, so now God wants to bring His people back to those remnants of Isaiah.</p>
      <p>The very busy Threcius has gone with Gilovius, a minister of God, to Warsaw for the diet, where the main topic will be the tithes, that is, the agreement between the laity and the clergy, besides the war. For the Muscovite broke the truce, offended by us because the Tartars reached him through the borders of Podolia and devastated his regions far and wide with fire and sword last year, perhaps with our king somewhat conniving. For indeed, our envoys were badly received by him.</p>
      <p>Barsi, the Voivode of Kraków, an enemy of the evangelicals, has died. In Kraków, there are 600 Germans in the evangelical assembly, who usually hold meetings in a tall house bought by the church. In Moravia and Bohemia, several distinguished men (about 20) of the Bohemian Brethren's communion have passed away.</p>
      <p>Blahosinus and Herbertus were the main ones, and it is amazing how all that pious church mourns them. In Poland, too, many nobles have died, yet more have been killed by drunkenness. May the Lord keep us all for the glory of His name. Amen. I wish to know from you whether your son-in-law, Mr. Simler, received the fur coat from Froschauer, which my lord, the Voivode, had sent him as a gift.</p>
      <p>I instructed Hohesaxio on what he should write to you about France. Please, my father, ensure that these letters quickly reach those to whom they are addressed. I hear quietly that war is being prepared at sea. But since the English are now allied with the French by treaty, whatever is being done secretly, I think it is against that most Catholic one. The rest, which is not safe to write, will be revealed in due time. We live safely and quietly. Envoys from Scotland have come to the king, and soon they will come from England too; the king will also send his own to England. The people of La Rochelle are said to be carefully watching the gates; if so, they fear something. Let us truly fear our Lord God from the heart.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man.</p>
      <p>Paris, 1572, April 26, from the house of Amariton, the lawyer, near Vaesalum.</p>
      <p>Your loving and respectful in Christ as a father, Johannes a Lasco, Pole.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zurich, his... honorable or Mr. Johann Wolf.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
