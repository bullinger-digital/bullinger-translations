      <p>Greetings. I write to you, my dearest brother, only to let you know that I have received all the letters you sent in good faith. Initially, those you entrusted to Johann Itel, and then those I received today..., who had shared yours with me a little earlier. I am amazed at how you manage all these tasks alone. But with God's blessing, everything turns out well; I pray that He blesses you and grants a most fortunate outcome to this crowd. I expect a happy conclusion.</p>
      <p>We have no news from France. It is written from Antwerp on April 12: The Huguenots have taken the city of Brielle in Holland; soon they destroyed all the temples and filled the summit as a fortification. However, Alba sent his Spaniards to more fortified places. But the more famous cities did not want to let these garrisons in, namely Dordrecht, Delft, Utrecht (called Traiectum), and Vlissingen. However, Rotterdam let them in; the Spanish garrison soldiers soon stabbed over 200 citizens and wounded many more. Therefore, other cities see what they can expect from such reinforcements. The rumors about these events are varied, as the reports are different; but these are written as the most certain.</p>
      <p>I am as well as I can be, but quite well by God's grace; I praise the Lord, as He provides me with the strength to teach in the church according to my duty. Let us diligently pray to the Lord to help us and His endangered church and to strengthen us in faith against the deceits of the Antichrist. In France, a synod will be held by the evangelicals in NÃ®mes this May; may the Lord bless it and keep you with your family.</p>
      <p>Zurich, May 2, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I have no acquaintance in Ulm; for Dominus Rabus is rabid against us Lutherans.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the church in Chur, my dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
