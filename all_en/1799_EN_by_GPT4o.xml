      <p>Greetings. Philippus Galitius, the minister of Chur, sent me your letters, most excellent Bullinger, a few days ago, along with those you had written to Mr. Vergerius. I immediately ensured that they were delivered to Vergerius, who is now residing in the Valtellina, through a trustworthy messenger, as you had requested of me, so that I believe you can easily infer from his response. If there is any other way I can be of service to you and the other esteemed fathers there, my most revered lords, here I am, ready to do so willingly and sincerely. Farewell in the Lord for now, and continue to love us as you do. Chiavenna, January 26, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, whatever I am, Francesco Negri.</p>
      <p>You will forward my letters to our Coelius in Basel at your convenience; for in this matter, I seek not the speed of the messenger, but only fidelity. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the word of God, my most esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
