    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Even though Poullain has nothing special to report, he still wants to write to the Zurich pastors before his journey home [Lille in Flanders] and sincerely thank them for their hospitality. Should he return safely from his journey (the Zurichers should pray for this), he would very much like to be admitted to the Zurich church, especially since he has long appreciated it for its scholars (whom he finally got to see) and their publications. In hindsight, he does not understand why he postponed this visit for so long! The Zurich church surpasses all the churches he has been able to get to know before! However, he wishes he had not been so troubled during his visit. It will probably be years, not days, before he can return to Zurich, and if his journey ends happily, he wishes to obtain a position in Zurich! The Zurichers should remember him in their prayers.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] There is nothing to report on the political situation that the Zurichers do not already know. Yesterday, the imperial envoy [Jean Mouchet] (a son-in-law of Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle) left Basel quite dissatisfied, to go to Schaffhausen and from there perhaps to Constance. In Basel, he did nothing different than in Zurich. He spoke well and promised much. But not for nothing did [Horace] say that many promises are suspect. May the Helvetians beware of the Spaniard's [Emperor Charles V's] cunning, learn from the misfortune of others, hold on to their freedom, and be content to admire these princes from afar! This is not to be taken as advice, as the Zurichers are rather his advisors. He merely wants to express that he feels comfortable in their presence and gladly shares his thoughts with them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Poullain greatly fears that Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony has fallen into the hands of a merciless enemy. May the Lord comfort the Elector! His children are said to have survived. Moreover, the Hanseatic cities and also Christian III of Denmark are reportedly rushing to his aid. God Zebaoth will not abandon his church and will soon free it from this tyrant, whom he will banish to the wild beasts. But first, God's people must repent and do penance. May the Lord have mercy on all and spur everyone to a better life!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] It is said that King Henry II is recruiting mercenaries near Basel and Strasbourg. The Zurichers will already know this and also be better informed about the king's intentions than the people of Basel. The war campaign planned by the king is probably the reason why he postponed his coronation by a year. He will want to finance the campaign with the money saved. Moreover, he seems to be one of those people who do not want to participate in festivities when they are planning a war. But perhaps there is also a ruse hidden there. May the Lord turn everything to good!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The day before yesterday, a nobleman from Brabant named Nicolas Micault left Basel. Together with his brother-in-law [Gilles de Nobili] and his sister [Adrienne], he was on a journey from Italy to the Netherlands. Had he been alone, he would have made a detour to Zurich. He commends himself to the prayers of the Zurichers. They should ask the Lord to give him the strength to leave Babylon. He entrusted Poullain with the letters enclosed with this letter [No. 2874 and No. 2900] for forwarding to Zurich.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Poullain sends a sheet to John Hooper, on which Bucer's latest remarks on the Lord's Supper [which he wrote in June 1544 at József Macarius' request] are recorded. Should the Zurichers be interested in the text, they can ask Hooper for it. However, Poullain had made this copy in great haste. The Zurichers should therefore forgive the poorly legible handwriting. He came across it while reviewing his papers, as he was revising his writing [Traicte tres utile du s. sacrement de la cene] written a few months ago for the [French-speaking Protestants]. Now it will be published. May the Lord bless Poullain's first treatise!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings. The Zurich pastors should count him among their disciples. May the Lord bless them and their wives, their school, as well as the whole church!</p>

      <p>S. P. E. Although I have nothing at this time worthy of your wisdom and dignity, yet, when I consider your singular kindness towards me, I have judged it worthwhile, now as I am setting out for my homeland, to greet you all with a brief letter and thus at least to make known to you that my mind is neither forgetful of you nor thinks so humbly of you, but rather pursues you with all love, zeal, and veneration, as is fitting. Therefore, nothing is more in my prayers now, if God by your prayers grants me a prosperous journey, than to be received into the bosom of this church, which I have always pursued with singular love and reverence, both for the outstanding learning of its scholars combined with equal piety, and for its polity, which easily surpasses all others I have seen or heard of. Nor do I know what genius has hitherto prevented me from visiting it, although I judged it alone, above all others, worthy of the name of a church. At last, it has been granted to me to see such dear heads and to speak with them in person with no less pleasure and profit than I was accustomed to delight and be instructed by the monuments of the absent while I was absent. I wish indeed that this had happened at another time when I was not so full of troubles. Yet I am greatly rejoiced that it has at some time been granted to me by God to see your faces. Therefore, believe me, it is years, not days, that I count before I return to you with my business completed. May Christ grant that, however, with the happy success of this journey, I may obtain some leisure or rather business among you. I ask you all to remember this wish of mine in your prayers.</p>

      <p>There is nothing to report here about public affairs that you do not already know. For you know the same things. The emperor's envoy, the son-in-law of Granvelle, was present, who left for Schaffhausen yesterday not very cheerful. From there I hear he is thinking of Constance. You ask what he did. The same as with you. What did he report? The same as he brought: words for words. May Christ grant the Swiss the wisdom to hold on to it steadfastly, so that they do not easily allow themselves to be deceived by the Spaniard. He has the appearance of friendship and favor, nor is he lacking in great skill in promising. But what does he say? "Many promises (he says) lighten faith." And this ambition of his for your friendship is very suspicious to me! May the Lord Jesus always grant you wisdom and constancy, so that, taught by the danger of others, you may rather keep all these princes and rulers in some admiration of your virtue, rather than rashly give yourselves into servitude by betraying your liberty. These are my prayers, which I make daily to God for you. For I do not write these things as advice (for who would be a counselor here?), but because it pleases me to abuse your humanity in this way and to converse more familiarly.</p>

      <p>Concerning the Elector of Saxony, I fear it is too true that he has fallen into the hands of a most merciless enemy. May the Lord Jesus comfort him! However, they say his sons are surviving and that the maritime cities are sending aid with the Dane and the Dacian. But the Lord of Hosts will not forsake his church and will soon come to overthrow this tyrant, who is boasting with such success, and cast him among the wild beasts! But one thing must happen first: For the people of God have not yet returned to their hearts to repent of their past life. May the Lord Jesus look kindly upon us all and call us back to the pursuit of a purer life!</p>

      <p>Here and everywhere, even in Strasbourg, soldiers are being recruited for the French. You know the same and perhaps more certainly what he intends than we do. This is the reason for the postponement of the coronation for a year. For I hear that his affairs are well provided for. Therefore, if he had this war in mind, he preferred to spend those expenses, which would have been made in that inauguration, on soldiers. And it is perhaps of a noble mind not to have wanted, when he bears a hostile mind, to be present at such great joy. Yet I fear there may be some evil plan hidden. May the Lord Jesus turn everything to his glory and the salvation of his own!</p>

      <p>The day before yesterday, a certain nobleman from Brabant, having returned from Italy, left here, a truly pious and learned man, Nicolas Micault. He was held in great longing for you all. For his brother-in-law, who with his wife is seeking Lower Germany, was an impediment to his turning aside to you. He ordered me to greet you most dutifully, also asking to be helped by your prayers to the Lord, that he may someday be able to leave Babylon. He gave letters enclosed with this to be sent to you, which he would have preferred to deliver himself.</p>

      <p>I am sending to Mr. Hooper a sheet on which the latest commentary of Bucer on the supper is contained. If you please, you will ask him for it, but excuse the errors of the writing; for it perhaps fell into my hands while I was gathering papers, nor is there time to transcribe it anew. For I am now very busy revising some of my writing, which I wrote a few months ago for the sake of our people, which (because we tried to deliver everything simply and plainly there) we are now publishing, commending the first fruits of our studies to the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Therefore, farewell in Christ, most excellent men, and count me among your disciples. Pray to the Lord for me; I in turn for you. May the Lord Jesus support and guide you and your wives, your dearest children, your school, and the whole church with his spirit in obedience to his will. In Basel, standing almost on one foot. On the third day before the Nones of June in the year 1547. Your most loving and devoted disciple and brother in Christ, Valérand Poullain.</p>
