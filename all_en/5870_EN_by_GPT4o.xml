      <p>Greetings. Most distinguished man, I am sending you this letter addressed to your kindness; I received one from our Threcius in Marburg, and another from the governor of the most illustrious Prince Nikolaus Radziwiłł, Duke in Olyka's son. For your information, he recently came to Strasbourg for the sake of his studies, a very handsome and modest 14-year-old boy, to whom you, if you ever wish to write to the Duke himself, can conveniently send letters; for he will transmit them without difficulty to his parent in Lithuania. When I inquired about him from the governor himself, whether he had been led astray by our tritheists or not, he plainly denied it, affirming that he either ignores these matters or frequently and sharply rebukes those who introduce a new doctrine about the Trinity. He favored Blandrata before he understood what kind of man he was, whom he now neglects. It is said that Blandrata has gone to Moldavia to the despot. I know that Threcius is soon to return to his homeland; he was waiting for the fair and lived for some time with Mr. Hipperius. Not all ministers have yet acquiesced to that pious and learned admonition of both Calvin and your Simler; certainly, the more modest ones have been abundantly satisfied. Recently, Paulus Gregorius, the creator of that table about the Trinity, wrote to me, asserting the same error as before; he always distinguishes, never admitting that the three are one. I immediately sent your letters, which you brought to me, to the Cikovios in Leipzig. However, the fact that these reach you late is certainly not my fault, but theirs, who retain them for a long time before delivering them, some of which I brought here with me from Heidelberg. For several of us Poles came here to avoid the plague, which was already appearing quite clearly in Heidelberg, and now Mr. Wenceslaus von Ostrorog, who was recently with you, along with his brother. Felix Cruciger, the superintendent, when he was attacking the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity in a sermon, suddenly almost collapsed and died. What remains, I commend you, my father in the Lord, to God and pray that you may be happy for a long time and assist our church with your strength. Mr. von Ostrorog sends you his regards. Farewell and know that I am devoted to your excellence.</p>
      <p>Basel, September 5, 1563.</p>
      <p>Johannes a Lasco, the most devoted to your dignity.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the chief pastor of the Church of Zurich, to be honored with singular respect in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Johannes a Lasco, the Pole.</p>
