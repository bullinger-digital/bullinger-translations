    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer sends a letter from Georg Frölich [No. 2453] and is surprised that Bullinger did not respond through [Barbara Winzürn, known as Schriber], the wife of the Konstanz tailor Thomas, who had come to Zurich because of the inheritance that was allocated to her by [Agathe] Studler. He had given her letters for Bullinger, [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Konrad] Hofherr, and [Jakob] Ruf, which he had written on May 24. Since only Ruf has responded, Blarer believes that the others did not receive the letters. He now writes to Ruf again and asks Bullinger to deliver his letter to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Regarding the Imperial Diet [at Regensburg], Frölich will have written the same to Bullinger as [to Konstanz]; apart from a loss of money and time, nothing is to be expected from it. Some fear the dissolution of the [Schmalkaldic League], but Frölich hopes for better. In view of the negligence of the [Protestants], their successes will be attributable to God alone.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The Reformation carried out in Ravensburg has retained quite a bit of superstition. The council did not want to appoint pastors from Swabia, as they suspected them of fanaticism. Against the wishes of many citizens, they followed the example of Wittenberg and Nuremberg. Furthermore, the city was admitted to the Schmalkaldic League, the extension of which is to be negotiated at the Imperial Diet.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Greetings.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- [P.S.:] From Strasbourg, Blarer learned that Emperor [Charles V] has summoned the Rhenish nobility and informed them that he does not intend to force them into servitude. Additionally, he extracted money from them under the pretext of wanting to free them from illegal taxation by the princes. This will surely lead to discord!</p>

      <p>S. I am sending here the letters of our Georg Frölich, which I received four days ago, and I am very surprised that you did not respond through the wife of our tailor Thomas, who wanted to claim the inheritance of Studler along with some others. Through her, I had written to you, as well as to Gwalther and Curio, neither of whom have replied, so I suspect that you received nothing from her. I am very eager to be informed by you about this matter. Our letters were dated May 24. I also wrote to your surgeon Ruf, but he was the only one who responded through her; I am writing to him again now, and I am asking you to ensure that our letter is delivered to him.</p>

      <p>We have nothing new that is worth writing to you about. I have no doubt that Frölich has written to you about the Imperial Diet the same as he has to us. We expect nothing from it but expense and a waste of precious time. Some fear that our alliance will dissolve into disarray. I hope for better, although our people should have acted differently than they have. However, whatever good comes to us from this negligence will be attributed entirely to the Lord's kindness, and there will be nothing left for human wisdom to boast about.</p>

      <p>The church in Ravensburg is being established quite superstitiously. The council did not want to involve any of the other ministers from the Swabian and neighboring churches in this reformation, as they suspect them all of being infected with fanaticism. Therefore, they are modeling everything after the example of Wittenberg and Nuremberg, although many there would gladly follow more solid teachings. However, the majority (as is often the case) prevailed not by judgment but by numbers. They have been admitted to our league, the extension of which is now being discussed at the Imperial Diet. Let us pray to the Lord that all may come to know and embrace better things everywhere.</p>

      <p>The emperor has summoned the Rhenish nobility and justified himself, saying that he is not the one who intends to force them into servitude, as he has been portrayed to them. He has promised them much good, etc., and at the same time extracted a sum of money from them under the pretext that he wants to free them so that they will not be taxed by the princes. However, this will become a new source of discord and serve too much division. This is written to me from Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
