    <p xml:id="regest1">Would not bother Bullinger if it were not important for the common cause of faith. Recently, Gervasius Schuler bitterly complained to Euander about Bullinger's silence, to whom he had written three times without success, as he fears he has been maligned in connection with the [Wittenberg] Concord; however, he assured that he and the people of Memmingen have not deviated an inch from Zwingli's teachings. Euander was able to appease him, but asks Bullinger to break his silence so that the friendship can continue and Schuler can be kept away from Lutheranism.</p>

      <p>I had certainly resolved with myself, most learned man, never to trouble you with my letters again, unless some issue arose that, if passed over in silence, would be a great detriment to you and indeed to our common profession of faith. I know you are so wholly devoted to serious and sacred matters that you scarcely have time to read my letters (in which I have so often lamented the importunity and insolence of certain foolish people, and complained about my impatience in this matter), let alone respond to them in full.</p>
      <p>However, recently Gervasius Schuler, your acquaintance, was here. After I had discussed many things seriously with him about the matter of the Eucharist, he began to complain to me familiarly and with great agitation about your long silence towards him, and that you have not yet responded to his three letters, not even a jot. He said he feared that some slanderer had accused him to you in connection with the recently forged concord, but he was glad that this was falsely done, if it was done at all; for he could swear solemnly that he has not deviated a finger's breadth from the teachings of our Zwingli, which you still hold, nor would the people of Memmingen allow it if he varied even slightly from this holy man's and indeed your doctrine, so devoted are they to Zwingli.</p>
      <p>And when I excused your adamantine affairs and holy occupations, asserting that you are more candid and cordial than to harbor grudges, and more generous than not to amicably address any injury (if any had occurred), and that friendship should not be judged solely by the duty of writing or replying, which even common friends could perform, but by the matter itself and the spirit, with this somewhat clumsy speech of mine, he became a little more mild and accepted the excuse, yet he promised that he would remain your brother and friend perpetually, but also threatened that he would temper his writing in the future.</p>
      <p>Hence, most humane man, I consider it my duty to present my untimely disturbances to you, even now occupied, while I ask and urge you to break this epistolary silence towards him at the earliest opportunity, lest charity and mutual friendship between you cool and fade away over such a trivial occasion; for as far as I understand from him, he still fully agrees with us or at least does not (as far as I know) oppose, as our foolish, stupid, and unlearned preachers do; or if he did oppose a little (which I swear by Jupiter I do not think), he seems to be able to be recalled from that Lutheran madness.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I consider that this man should be supported by your letters in every way, thus you will absolve yourself from great suspicion with him, relieve him of great annoyance, and greatly assist our cause, which you yourself can more easily estimate with your singular prudence.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>In Kempten, February 17.</p>
      <p>What is happening to me now would be troublesome for you to read. Benedikt Euander, your most devoted.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, a pious and learned man, chief preacher of Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
