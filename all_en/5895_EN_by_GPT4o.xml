      <p>Greetings. Behold, once again, the good men whom I had previously recommended to you have prevailed upon me to trouble you on their behalf.</p>
      <p>They have experienced how beneficial your support has been, because the authority of your most honorable council has prevailed so much among the Rhaetians that they easily obtained what they wanted.</p>
      <p>You remember, however, what the main point of their request was; namely, because they were unjustly deprived of their goods, that they might recover the price from the revenue, which the Milanese priests still collect in Valtellina or the Tellina Valley.</p>
      <p>This was decreed with great consensus; it remains for them to take action, because the execution has been suspended until now.</p>
      <p>If your most honorable council encourages the Rhaetians, they do not doubt that the matter will soon be settled.</p>
      <p>Moreover, it will not be difficult to persuade them, because unless the Rhaetians actually carry out what they have declared, they will expose themselves to ridicule, as if they had rashly and frivolously made threats.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is in their interest to consistently complete what was decreed in their public assembly, and indeed it would not be honorable to disappoint the hopes of good men.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, it is almost necessary for them to defend their benefit, and perhaps this matter will be prolonged, because the contention will bring about some change.</p>
      <p>Therefore, you will forgive me, venerable brother, if I trouble you again, and then you will not deny me a second recommendation.</p>
      <p>The affairs of France are always in confusion.</p>
      <p>The Parisians have somewhat relaxed their obstinacy.</p>
      <p>The King, however, who had approached near the walls, turned back his course.</p>
      <p>The Queen Mother, when she fell from her horse, severely injured her skull, yet she seems to have escaped danger; although she pretends to be neutral, many signs of her treachery are noted.</p>
      <p>The Chancellor is liberal in his edicts as usual; but many do not obey.</p>
      <p>Unless the Queen soon defects from the Guise, fearful disturbances will break out anew.</p>
      <p>What plan the Admiral is contemplating, I do not know; in the letters I received yesterday, he shows great security.</p>
      <p>Among many edicts, one is memorable, that the King orders all priesthoods to be relinquished by those who have professed the pure religion.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most illustrious and highly esteemed brother. I pray for much health to all your colleagues and your family.</p>
      <p>May God keep you safe!</p>
      <p>Geneva, the day before the calends of October 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>Your Ionville greets you reverently and sincerely.</p>
