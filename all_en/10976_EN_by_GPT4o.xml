    <p xml:id="regest1">Confidentially presents him with a list of questions that were sent [from Strasbourg] to Basel to hear the opinion of the scholars there. The debate concerns the stance of the Protestants towards the announced council, which is to be negotiated in Schmalkalden from February 7. He anticipates that Zurich might also be consulted and asks Bullinger for a prompt response. Assures him that there is no threat of Basel becoming alienated from Zurich [in the matter of concord]. Requests assistance in trying to prevent Theodor [Bibliander] from drafting a justification against Bucer. Inquires about Utinger's description of the Swabian War. The letter to Luther was sent on January 12. He, along with Grynäus, responds to the above questions to the council today.</p>

      <p>Greetings. What I send to you, my Bullinger, I send in such a way that you do not speak a word to anyone; for the same was sent to our senate, yet so that they may seek the advice of their scholars. And I am forbidden to say anything to other brothers, individually, but only from the friendly prohibition of the lords, indeed the princes and friends, who have recommended the same silence to us.</p>
      <p>The Dukes of Saxony and Hesse have called a meeting of the evangelical princes and cities along with their scholars, whom they must bring with them to Schmalkalden on the seventh of February to consult on the following articles concerning the future council of the pope. Now hear the articles in order. Since the council is convened to eradicate heresies, not for any Christian business, what should the evangelical princes do here, indeed all of us together. And whether it is likely that the pope will allow a conference or debate on matters of faith or that he will allow the articles, which he has condemned so far, to be declared. Then, if he permits these, whether it can be conveniently requested from the emperor and the king, his brother, that the location be changed from Mantua to Germany for the imperial letters given at the last diet in Augsburg. So that in this council, matters are conducted and judged by gentle, pious, learned, and intelligent men, not by passionate, anointed prelates, as was done in the Council of Constance. Whether indeed a delegation to the emperor and his brother should be made before or after the council is convened. By chance, if nothing is obtained from the said matters and the princes of the empire, who stand with us, are not called to the Mantuan council, or if they are called with the others, whether they should comply or use an appropriate protest or writing. The same if they are summoned or warned by penalty to abandon their doctrine and adhere to the pope, what should be given to the envoys in their instructions. How to obtain clear security for the envoys and their free speech and their bodies. Through which persons the council should be sought. And since it is to be feared that the adversaries will try to separate the princes and preachers, so that they alone are in defending their cause, how this should be prevented. And that all remain together as in Augsburg. If mandates summoning our party and preachers to court by the pope or council are insinuated, under what conditions they should be received. If the pope commands under penalty to restore temples, ordinances, anointed ones, and monks, what should be done? Since it is clear that the pope is attempting evil through this council (and is practicing), when things have already been determined that are against the word, and the pope wishes to pursue them with his members, what should be done against it? And if there is anything else that seems to pertain to this council.</p>
      <p>These things, behold my Bullinger, I write impelled by brotherly charity - although forbidden to do so -, so that you may secretly consider what should be done if something similar comes to you in the future. It is being consulted here, I know, how these things may also be sent to you. And the matter needs consultation, since the same have been sent to us secretly and without the knowledge of the leaders of the business. What will happen, however, I do not know at all. When you have considered everything, be careful not to respond soon, thus the work is done. And if anything seems to be added, please write to me likewise. For although they have been carefully thought out, it seems to me that some things have been omitted, which should not be considered last. So far about these things.</p>
      <p>You recently wrote about some defection of ours from you. Nothing of the sort is to be feared. For what we have responded, they are such that they stand with you.</p>
      <p>I would like you to diligently dissuade Theodor from writing an apology against Bucer. For it cannot be Christian, whatever time he expects. Indeed, I will shortly write to him myself, what seems to me here.</p>
      <p>The Swabian War was left written by Utinger. I wish to know if it is at hand.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily with all yours.</p>
      <p>Basel, hastily, January 16, 1537.</p>
      <p>Yours, Os. Myconius.</p>
      <p>The common writings were finally sent to Luther on January 12. Grynäus and I responded to the proposed articles to the senate today.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Bishop of the Zurichers, his esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
