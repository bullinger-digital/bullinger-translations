      <p>The grace of Christ be with you. The messenger was in a great hurry to leave; hence it happened, esteemed patron and brother in Christ, that I was unable to write what I wanted. The prince is expected daily, I wish he would not change his customs and ceremonies, which he uses in the duchy,... bears. I have business with M.</p>
      <p>Caspar Greter, the court preacher, who insists on revising our catechism to the form of Württemberg, about which, if I had time, I would say more. Privately, he wishes to impose upon us an examination before the meal and a greater explanation of the presence of Christ, etc., and I do not know what else. I have with me a booklet published by the Duke of Prussia on justification, about which Osiander and others have been raving for almost three years; if you do not have it, I would send it along with the Württemberg Confession. Farewell, farewell, and as you are accustomed, pray for me. Greet everyone. May 16, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Erb.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, always to be esteemed as a brother in Christ.</p>
