      <p>Here is for you again a new task. The discipline of the church, which is moderate here, has been attacked for a full seven years now by all who wish to live without restraint. But the dissolute people from the common folk would not cause us so much trouble if they did not have leaders who seek power for themselves from their license. It has now come to the point that whatever ecclesiastical order has prevailed until now is being undermined, unless a remedy is brought from there. And for this reason, our excellent brother, Lord Budaeus, did not hesitate to undertake a journey to you in this harsh time of the year, to inform you of the whole matter. The brief summary, however, is that the most honorable council should respond that the form we have followed until now is consistent with the word of God, and then reject novelty. You will understand the rest from the common letters, which I wrote with the condition that, if it is not expedient to spread them further, you communicate them specifically to Mr. Gwalther. I leave this entirely to your judgment. If I obtain those two points from you, that your council confirms our laws with its vote, cutting off all ambition and deterring our people from the pursuit of novelty, this church will have peace for a long time. I trust that my letters, which I sent to you earlier, have been delivered, in which I thanked you all in my and my brothers' name for the faithful and holy response you gave in the Servetus case. That excellent commendation with which you honored us had its weight among the good, but it could not yet restrain the unbridled and the lost, as you see. However, I hope for better things soon, if we are helped from there. A citizen of yours brought the book of Servetus and that medley you requested to you. You will know more about the miserable devastation of England than is expedient. Therefore, I refrain from writing. Farewell, most distinguished man and venerable brother. Many greetings to Mr. Gwalther, your wife, your sons-in-law, and the faithful. May the Lord protect you all with His defense and guide you with His spirit. Geneva, 26th of November, 1553.</p>
