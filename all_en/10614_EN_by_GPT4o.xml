      <p>Greetings. On the penultimate day of April, Megander will attend the synod in Brugg, dearest Heinrich. I wanted to inform you of this all the more willingly, so that I may not seem to neglect your request in any way.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, let it not be hidden from you the calamity of our city, which we suffered on the morning of the 19th of this month after the second hour. A very fierce fire, aided by a favorable wind, burned 25 houses besides barns and granaries in the upper part of the city, which they call "an der Spittelgasse." No Bernese has seen such a fire before, as one could not approach the fire until the wind changed, and if it had not changed, the entire city would have been in danger. On the same day at night, very close to the city, 2 farms with houses, barns, and granaries were burned. I did not want to keep this from you, as we were in great concern.</p>
      <p>The messenger informed me too late, yet I know nothing further. Dear friend, please write. I have not received any letters since Zofingen. The messenger is very reliable, one of the May family, Jakob May's brother, who is bringing back two brothers from Enoch [Metzger], who has passed away.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>April 22, in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Your Berchtold H.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
