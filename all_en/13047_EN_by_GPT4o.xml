    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Since Bullinger has a reliable person available in Hieronymus Hürus, he now entrusts this person (and not another, as planned) with the enclosed letter [not received], in which he shares something that has been troubling him for some time. May the people of Constance beware of the Iberian cunning of Emperor Charles V! He sends people to all cities who are thought to be his enemies, but who are actually his friends and agents. Just think of Wolfgang Rehlinger in Strasbourg, who is a friend of the one whose name Bullinger [subsequently] mentions with the secret alphabet: In Constance, [Sebastian] Schertlin [the name was written using the secret alphabet] could indeed be such an agent! Bullinger knows nothing for certain and even finds this man likable; but who knows what the Emperor is plotting! May God forgive Bullinger if he is mistaken. His love and care for the people of Constance drive him to present these perhaps devil-inspired concerns to Blarer. They are intended only for him, and he should immediately destroy the present letter!</p>

      <p>S. D. Hieronymus Hürus brought these letters, which I had intended for another. And the ulcer has long been hidden in my heart, which, as I now reveal it, was advised by the fidelity of the messenger. No one else knows anything about this matter yet! You see the Spanish arts of Emperor Charles. He sends people everywhere into cities who seem to be enemies of the Emperor, but are actually friends and conciliators. See what Wolfgang Rehlinger has done in Strasbourg. He is a friend of the one I write about here in foreign letters: See that perhaps such a one is not among you as Schertlin. I have nothing certain. I also like the man, but the heart of the Emperor is inscrutable. May the Lord forgive me if I am mistaken here. But the love with which I embrace you and the anxiety that troubles me and drives me to present to you what perhaps the evil demon suggests. But to watch and to be vigilant is good. This is for you alone. Tear it up immediately! Let us pray to the Lord.</p>
