    <p xml:id="regest1">Since May 27, he has been back in Regensburg, where he was warmly received; the letters and gifts he brought were received with joy and appreciated as an expression of the growing community with the Swiss, only [Martin] Frecht complained about a lack of response. He was able to personally deliver the letter [from the Zurich council] to the prince [Philip of Hesse]; the prince has promised a reply and allowed him to join the Hessian theologians, he is also having Gwalther's horse fed and has inquired about the conditions in Zurich, but he probably won't stay in Regensburg much longer. The religious discussion has ended, and both sides will present their positions to Emperor [Charles V], with little hope of success. [Johannes] Eck is ill. Duke [Philip] of Pomerania has arrived; he matches the [Hessian] prince in his steadfastness. Otherwise, there is little new; the three colloquents of the opposing side are said to have been excommunicated due to their conciliatory stance, Gwalther will learn more about a conversation between the emperor and [Philip of Hesse], and nothing more is heard about Duke [Charles III] of Savoy. He is confident about the matter addressed in a letter sent to Winterthur; he has forwarded the complaint from Erasmus [Schmid?] to Dionysius [Melander] and expects it to be presented to the prince soon. He refers to the enclosure and promises further news. Greetings from several theologians, who will also write themselves; [Philip] Melanchthon plans a spa treatment for his sprained hand. Six drowned Spaniards were pulled from the Danube. Greetings. [Enclosure:] The emperor has based the colloquium on a book he is said to have received from scholars from Spain and other countries. There was no dispute over the first articles on anthropology and the doctrine of sin. The article on justification was rewritten. Some articles concerning the church were undisputed; the question of the authority of the church and councils was postponed. Agreement was reached on the sacraments in general, ordination, baptism, and confirmation. The Protestants opposed an article presented by the opposing side advocating transubstantiation and the veneration of the host with their own declaration. They also opposed the necessity of enumerating sins in confession and declared penances null and void. Further articles were controversial, so the Protestants also drafted counter-statements; on May 28, the discussion ended and everything was handed over to the emperor. [King] Ferdinand has almost bombarded Buda into submission, but Turkish troops are already near Griechisch Weißenburg [Belgrade]. Pope [Paul III] is expelling the [Colonna family] from Rome with the emperor's consent. Duke [William] of Jülich and Cleves has married [Jeanne d’Albret]. Five supplications against [Duke Henry] of Brunswick were presented to the emperor; they concern the arsonists, Henry's brother William [of Brunswick], Goslar, the Bishop of Hildesheim [Valentin von Tetleben], and the confiscation of transport goods. On Ascension Day [May 26], the princes, except [Philip] of Pomerania and the Landgrave, rode with the emperor to the church service; due to a rank dispute, Margrave George of Brandenburg left the church. On May 23, an arson attack was carried out on the inn where the Hessian theologians preach; on the same day, the steward of Count Palatine Philip [Bern von Hürnheim], an enemy of all Lutherans, drank himself to death. The clergy of Regensburg have asked Duke William of Bavaria for protection and shelter, but he declared himself unable to help them.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Know, most esteemed father, that by the aiding grace of God, I arrived safely and unharmed in Regensburg on May 27, where I found the previous goodwill of the preachers towards me to have increased more and more, and the favor of the prince to be more aroused by our letters. First of all, I handed over the common letters to be read, which pleased so much and moved the hearts of all, that on the very first day they were distributed among almost all the people of our religion. For this is the one thing that all rejoice and exult in, that they now finally hope for a firm concord between themselves and the Swiss, indeed they embrace it as if already accomplished. Seeing that these were so pleasing, I immediately added those that were written to individuals, which pleased even more because they seemed private and personal to each one. The gifts pleased them in a wonderful way. Corvinus immediately had Zwingli's image gilded. The others will do the same. Only Frecht complained that you had not replied; I affirmed that the multitude of affairs was the cause.</p>
      <p>I approached the most illustrious prince accompanied by Dionysius, and personally delivered the letters, which he received and read with great joy and eagerness. They undoubtedly pleased him, which will also be understood from his brief response; for he promised to do so. He also ordered that I remain with the preachers as long as he himself attends the diet. Moreover, he commanded that my horse be fed at his expense. He inquired about your health, that of Leo and Pellicanus, about the mutual concord of the Zurichers, about the unanimity of all the Swiss, about our religion, and about your hopes concerning this diet, to which I responded briefly and succinctly, and the order of our churches did not displease him. What else he added, I will either write with more certain news or reserve for my arrival. For I do not think I can stay here long. There are those who affirm that the prince will depart within a month. For what would he do, when neither judgment nor punishment is applied in his causes, when he sees religion disturbed by the vain consultations and illicit dispensations of men?</p>
      <p>The colloquy has been concluded; now both parties, having presented their writings to the emperor, present their opinions. There is no or very little hope of concord. For now, at last, they reveal their minds, who have hitherto excellently feigned piety.</p>
      <p>Eck is gravely ill with fever and mania; would that he were also struck down by the plague! A few days before my arrival, the Duke of Pomerania, a pious and strong man, arrived, who alone seems to imitate the steadfastness of our most illustrious prince. Besides, nothing is being done here by the princes that is worthy of writing or reading, which greatly distresses the minds of all good men. There are those who say that the three papist sect colloquents have been excommunicated by the pope because they conceded too much to us during the disputation. Our prince was with the emperor for several hours alone; what was done, I still do not know, although I will soon find out. All rumor about the Duke of Savoy has now fallen silent; I do not know what he is plotting or what monster he is nurturing.</p>
      <p>As for the letters sent to me from Winterthur, there is good hope that I can obtain all that is contained therein, if only things come to that point, which many hope for. I presented Erasmus's case to Dionysius, and as far as I can see, it will soon be referred to our prince; for there are many others who complain about the same injustice.</p>
      <p>You have all the other certain things here described in German, so that you may also share them with our people. If anything else happens, I will write to you shortly. Dr. Philipp Melanchthon, Dr. Corvinus, Melander, Draco, and Pistorius send you their most cordial greetings, and do not doubt that they will respond to your letters both kindly and copiously as soon as they can; for it is the opinion of all that they do not wish to be outdone by you in love. Dr. Philipp, due to his sprained hand, is about to leave for the baths on the advice of the doctors within three or four days.</p>
      <p>In these days, six Spaniards were found in the Danube, tied together with one rope by fishermen, two of whom were entirely clothed in silk.</p>
      <p>Greet on my behalf most dutifully Dr. Treasurer Werdmiller, Dr. Pellicanus, Theodor, Collin, Ammianus, and the others, but especially your mother and wife, most honorable matrons, with the whole family. Farewell, most esteemed father, and keep me, as you do, commended to you.</p>
      <p>Regensburg, 3rd day before the calends of June 1541.</p>
      <p>Your most observant</p>
      <p>Rod. Gwalther.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed father. Zurich.</p>
      <p>At the beginning of the colloquium, which is appointed here in Regensburg, His Imperial Majesty presented our people with a book, which (as Duke Frederick says) His Majesty received from excellent learned men from Spain and other countries and deemed suitable for preparing a way of concord concerning matters of our religion.</p>
      <p>Therefore, His Majesty has urged and requested our people to take this book in hand, to consider it, and to express their opinion on it. Therefore, this book was taken in hand, and in the first articles concerning the creation of man, free will, the cause of sin, and original sin, there was no dispute between the parties, although Eck and the three of ours did not like the book because of the many foreign and unusual expressions used therein.</p>
      <p>Concerning justification, the book had a long, verbose discourse that did not agree in all parts; therefore, Eck, Philipp, Bucer, and Pistorius left the book, and for several days the matter was freely disputed, and finally, they came to the proposed article.</p>
      <p>After that, the book had to be read again in the following articles concerning the church, the signs of the church, namely the word of God; it was allowed to pass, for they were generalities that were not particularly disputable, since they in their essence are not contrary to Christian love. Concerning the authority of the church, that the general councils cannot err, there was a fierce dispute, and finally, it was not reconciled, counter-writings were submitted by our party, and thus it was suspended.</p>
      <p>What sacraments are and the distinction of the sacraments, which are necessary, was allowed to pass. There was no dispute about ordination, yet so that when the reformation of the common churches takes place, who and how one should ordain, who should speak further about it. There is nothing contentious in the book about baptism. Concerning confirmation, it was answered that if one held the catechism, such ceremonies should not be highly contested. Concerning the sacrament of the body and blood of Christ, the opposing side fiercely disputed transubstantiation, having submitted an article against which ours submitted an article in which several points, namely transubstantiation, reservation, adoration, and the carrying around of the sacrament, were contested.</p>
      <p>Concerning confession and the enumeration of sins, there was much fiercer dispute, that enumeration is necessary. Likewise, concerning satisfaction. Against this, ours submitted an article and proof of the same, that enumeration is not necessary and satisfaction is nothing.</p>
      <p>Concerning marriage in general, there is nothing contentious in the book. However, it is attached to consider what to think about divorce; it should be postponed until the reformation.</p>
      <p>Concerning anointing, it has been sufficiently indicated by ours what to hold it for. But they did not want to dispute much about it, so the reformation proceeds.</p>
      <p>Concerning church governance, the invocation and merit of the saints, the sacrifice of the mass, private masses, both forms of the supper, the marriage of priests, and all this, partly there was fierce dispute, partly the book also uses a moderation. But as with all this, our people have set up three articles against it, and after ours were united in church discipline, the colloquium was concluded and on the twenty-eighth of May, all our matters were handed over to His Imperial Majesty.</p>
      <p>What will follow when it comes before the estates, God knows. Ferdinand has besieged Buda with 18,000 men and, as they say, has almost shot it to storm. But the Turk has quickly sent two of his pashas with 60,000 men to rescue the city, and they have already arrived at Griechisch Weißenburg. We will perhaps soon learn what God intends with this.</p>
      <p>The pope is gradually expelling the Colonna family from Rome, to which the emperor turns a blind eye. What end this will have, God knows. The Duke of Jülich and Cleves has married the Queen of Navarre, the sister's daughter of the King of France. His Imperial Majesty has now received five notable supplications against the Duke of Brunswick. The first was made by all our estates in common concerning the arson, in which all accusations are included, both of the deceased and the living. The second was made by his own brother, Duke William, who is now staying here with the Elector of Brandenburg. The third by the city of Goslar. The fourth by the Bishop of Hildesheim. The fifth by the cities that have held their goods on confiscated wagons. But I see little that His Imperial Majesty will handle in this, but lets him remain by his Imperial Majesty.</p>
      <p>On Ascension Day, all the princes rode with the emperor to the church, except the Duke of Pomerania and my gracious lord, the Landgrave. There has also arisen a great discord among the mentioned princes concerning rank, so that Margrave George of Brandenburg has gone out again.</p>
      <p>On the 23rd of May, a fire was found in the inn where my gracious lord's preachers preach. Praise be to God that it did not come to greater harm. On the same day, the princes of Anhalt held a banquet, inviting all the princes, among whom also sat the steward of Count Palatine Philip (who all his life was a blasphemer, despiser of the word, and drunkard); he began to rage and rave against the Lutherans, and according to his custom drank, finally went home, sat down again, and drank so long that he was carried to the grave in the morning.</p>
      <p>The priests of Regensburg have also petitioned Duke William of Bavaria to protect and shelter them, to which he replied that he could no longer help them, for it seemed to him that the matter would have Saint Valentine.</p>
