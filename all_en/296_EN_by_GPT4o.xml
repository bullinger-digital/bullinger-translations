      <p>Grace and peace in the Lord. Recently, esteemed lord, you were surprised and could not clearly understand what I requested from you through our schoolmaster.</p>
      <p>Know, therefore, that the one who lives at my table, when he unexpectedly decided to see Zürich, I asked him to approach you and greet you with my words, as I did not have the time to write then, and to inform you that if you had anything to send to me, he would perform the duty of bringing it to me, especially if the first 13 chapters of Isaiah were completed, so that you would have someone to whom you could safely entrust them, as you recently promised me out of your usual kindness. However, since I understand that you have not yet progressed that far, I do not take it badly nor do I urge you to send them until you have completed the first part. But in the meantime, I ask as earnestly as possible that you send me, now through our Leopold or another reliable person, those notes you have on the Gospel of Matthew; I will ensure that they are returned to you in full shortly.</p>
      <p>If you have any certain information about the defection of Ghent from the Emperor and about the massacre at Magdeburg or other matters, I would like you to add it to the letter, if your duties allow. I dare to request this from you with more confidence because I have long known your goodwill towards me to be such that I dare to promise myself anything from you, and I have never been deceived so far; therefore, I hope I can still maintain this old favor.</p>
      <p>I give you the greatest thanks (which should have been done first) for your hospitality, with which you recently treated me while I was with you.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. My wife sends her greetings to you. Please convey my most respectful greetings to Mr. Gwalther on my behalf.</p>
      <p>In Aarau, hastily, 9th October 1548.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your kindness, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the Church of Zürich, his esteemed lord.</p>
