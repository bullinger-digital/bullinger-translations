    <p xml:id="regest1">The bearer of the letter reports on the unexpectedly erupted persecution of the brothers in Nîmes; in Geneva, it was believed that Count Wilhelm [von Fürstenberg] had approached King [Francis I] at the request of Strasbourg and Basel and had secured the release of all prisoners, but now two have been burned, and others are in mortal danger. Since the people of Geneva have heard that a clause for the protection of fellow believers is included in a treaty [of the Swiss cantons] with the king, they urgently request to prompt the authorities to intervene.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace to you from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ, most friendly brothers and uniquely esteemed by us. We will briefly summarize the matter for which we have deemed it necessary to send this man to you. In the not insignificant town of Nîmes, in the language now called Occitan, a new cruelty of the impious has recently erupted against the wretched brothers who live scattered there, while we suspected nothing of the sort. We had not long ago received public letters from the Senates of Strasbourg and Basel, in which the safety and well-being of all those who were then held in chains throughout France were commended to Count Wilhelm. He was said to have obtained from the King that all should be released. In this hope, we rested securely until it was reported to us that the fire was raging there vehemently. Two were burned, about whose death you will hear from an eyewitness. If he can narrate to you in Latin what he reported to us. Many have been thrown into chains, who are in danger of their lives unless their fury is promptly countered, as they are now drunk with the blood of the two and will otherwise make no end of their cruelty. Those two exhibited singular constancy to their last breath, although their patience was tested with exquisite cruelty. But who knows whether the same greatness of spirit will stand firm in others? Therefore, help must be provided in time, if in any way possible, lest those who are weaker fall into terror. Furthermore, it must be most carefully avoided that the blood of the pious becomes cheap to us, which we know to be precious in the sight of the Lord. We hear that a treaty has recently been struck by your Princes with our King, in which some mention was made of religion, namely that those who agree with you in the sense of religion should not henceforth be punished with the usual severity. If this is true, such a great opportunity to help the brothers must not be missed, to whom Christ calls us to bring aid not only with a clear voice but also complains of being deserted if they are deserted. Therefore, most excellent and pious brothers, devote yourselves entirely to this cause with the sincerity of your spirit. Because we trust that you will do this of your own accord, we will not say more to you. Therefore, go and ensure with your Senate that the King is seriously addressed: and that as quickly as possible, lest those furious ones anticipate. For you know how diligent their wickedness is. May the Lord Jesus enrich you more and more each day with new increases of His spirit, most learned and beloved brothers.</p>
      <p>Geneva, 13th of November 1537.</p>
      <p>Your most loving and esteemed brothers, the ministers of the Church of Geneva. To our brothers and fellow ministers in the Lord, the pastors of the Church of Zürich.</p>
