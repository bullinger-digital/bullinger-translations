      <p>Regarding the Gallic civil war, about which now all letters from everyone are written, I have this to say: For more than 30 years, I have often thought to myself about what outcome those most bloody wars, which the kings of the French have waged against neighboring and distant nations for about 70 years, would finally have, namely against the Sicilians, Neapolitans, Apulians, and other peoples of Italy and the Allobroges, not to mention others in the meantime.</p>
      <p>They have continually used Swiss and German mercenary soldiers. No one can adequately and clearly explain the massacres, slaughters, fires, and devastations, which have afflicted many and powerful nations and almost destroyed some. Added to this is another equally cruel thing, that when the merciful and compassionate God wanted the light of His word to shine in the vast kingdom of France and true religion to be restored to it, the kings of France, the nobles, both ecclesiastical and political, wanted that light to be extinguished and true religion to be oppressed by superstition. Hence it happened that everywhere throughout France, stakes were erected, open slaughters were carried out, in which not blasphemers, usurers, adulterers, murderers, and parricides paid the deserved penalties; but the best people were dragged into them and, for the saving word of God, some were burned, others were cremated, others were strangled, others were hanged, others were broken and torn apart, many were cruelly killed in prisons by hunger and filth, and countless were driven into exile. I will say nothing now about the nefarious wantonness of the clergy, the revelry of the common people, and the lack of mercy towards afflicted Christians, nor about the abominable blasphemies hurled against the evangelical truth and other horrendous impieties not only committed with impunity but also defended: I only say that the matter in France has come to this, that they have bent and twisted the young king, that is, they have not administered the affairs of the kingdom according to their own pleasure, but have disturbed them, the queen, that whole beast, and Cardinal of Lorraine, a lecherous and impure priest.</p>
      <p>His sole study and all his plans are directed towards imposing the decrees of the Council of Trent on France and other kingdoms, which, concluding with acclamations, among other things, he said openly and in public assembly: "The holy, ecumenical, Tridentine synod; let us confess its faith, let us always keep its faith." To which the fathers responded: "Let us always confess, let us always keep." Cardinal of Lorraine added: "We all believe this, we all feel the same, we all agree and embrace and subscribe."</p>
      <p>This is the faith of blessed Peter and the apostles, this is the faith of the fathers, this is the faith of the orthodox." To which the fathers responded: "Thus we believe, thus we feel, thus we subscribe." He added: "Anathema to all heretics." They responded: "Anathema, anathema," etc. And the queen, wanting to gratify the supreme Roman pontiff, the antichrist, by whose favor and arts she came to the kingdom, having become the wife of King Heinrich, with Clement VII, with Francis I, king of the French, by agreements strives to receive and raise again the Roman pontificate falling in France, gradually removing the Huguenots, thus mockingly and derisively called the faithful confessors of Christ the Lord.</p>
      <p>In order to accomplish this more correctly, by cunning counsel, the highest offices and governance began to be entrusted to Italian magnates and the Guise family, which sells itself as the heir of the French kingdom, and others who seek private gain and are most hostile to the gospel; on the contrary, those who are of royal blood from ancient times and have been supporters of evangelical truth and public good began to be cast down and neglected.</p>
      <p>This very thing is said to be the chief cause of this civil war, although the royal faction seems to dissemble all this and accuse the Cond√© faction of rebellion or sedition and ambition for the kingdom, which, however, denies and denies in every way and solemnly affirms that it seeks the king's safety and the relief of the whole kingdom from unjust burdens and especially the freedom of true religion. Perhaps the ultimate outcome of events will declare what each seeks.</p>
      <p>Thus indeed the just Lord visits France and avenges innocent blood.</p>
      <p>Paulus Orosius in his history recounts several persecutions of the Christian church and always adds that they were severely punished by the Lord with plague, seditions, famine, wars, and other calamities. And when the Lord Himself pronounced in both Testaments: "Woe to you who plunder; will you not also be plundered?" it is not surprising that the once flourishing kingdom of France or the French is now being plundered by Italians, Spaniards, Germans, Swiss, and other nations.</p>
      <p>And would that by the same judgment of God, war not be transferred to the Swiss and Germans as to those who for more than 70 years followed the French standards, overturning everything far and wide with slaughters and devastations! In the times of Constantine, the Lord had exercised the most severe and cruel persecution of His church through Diocletian and Maximian, etc.</p>
      <p>Finally, however, having mercy on His torn and bloodied bride, He stirred up the most powerful spirit of Emperor Constantine, and with the armies of the infidels and persecutors routed, He gave peace to the church. Therefore, the Lord seems to be prayed to today as well, that having mercy on the most afflicted church, with His enemies turned, He may grant peace to the church and immediately come to judge the world. But if it seems to Him according to the prophecy of Daniel in chapter 7, that the beast should conquer and trample the saints, the Lord is to be prayed to again, that He may grant patience and steadfastness of faith to His own and avert scandal, etc.</p>
      <p>You have no doubt heard that on both sides the greatest forces are being gathered in France and that the matter is tending towards, unless the Lord by His goodness prevents it, a most bloody battle being decided, and whichever side wins, it will be a Cadmean victory.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, they say the Turk is making a most serious expedition by land and sea and will certainly send several hundred thousand into Hungary, to restore the Transylvanian prince Weywoda to the crown of Hungary, having recovered all that from ancient times and within human memory have been torn away from it by arts or force.</p>
      <p>If this is true, as I fear it is too true, with our sins, indeed our crimes, demanding such a Nebuchadnezzar, what great evils, good God, threaten us miserable ones? Lord, have mercy on us, and grant that with truly penitent hearts we may humbly meet You, justly angry, with supplicating prayers! I do not cease to incite the church committed to my faith and care to this.</p>
      <p>May the Lord keep us from evil! Forgive me, my lord, if I have been too talkative and troublesome to you in this matter.</p>
      <p>Given as in the letters, etc.</p>
      <p>Yours, the same, etc.</p>
