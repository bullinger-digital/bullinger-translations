      <p>S. D. I assume that you have received what I recently wrote about the Claronensian matter; now there is nothing to add to that, except that yesterday someone came here from Geneva, who reports that a selection of soldiers has been made in that city and the citizens fear that the Duke of Savoy might suddenly make an attack, although his plans are uncertain. It is reported from Rome that a printed speech was delivered before the Pope and the assembly of cardinals in the name of the King of Navarre, who is said to have sent an envoy and to have fallen at the feet of the most holy one, offering and promising stable obedience. Whether this prince pretended to worship the beast or whether these things are fabricated by malicious scoundrels, I am in doubt. The speech was recited by the learned Muretus as the author.</p>
      <p>There are those who are completely convinced that everything is fictitious and fabricated; I always think and have it fixed in my mind: "Do not put your trust in princes, nor in the sons of men, in whom there is no salvation." However, I can certainly affirm to you that the envoy of the king recently sent me from Solothurn the very example of the letters that had been received from the court in Orl√©ans; they contained the very thing that you have here included in the letters of Francis Hotman; the former he wrote to me, the latter to Martyr. Therefore, since different letters written by otherwise great men and brought from different places agree, I give them credence, yet in such a way that I trust nothing in them, but only in our Lord God. I ask that you promptly return both examples of the letters wrapped in your next message. I am sending the booklet again, not only to overwhelm you with my writings but almost to exhaust you; for I am sending the book on councils, but I beg you not to share it with others before a month; Froschauer fears that it might be reprinted. Farewell together with Master Matthias and all good people.</p>
      <p>Zurich, February 3, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Master Ambrosius Blaurer, residing in Winterthur, my esteemed lord and dear brother. Winterthur.</p>
