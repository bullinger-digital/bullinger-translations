      <p>Greetings. I saw your latest writings on Jeremiah, most esteemed father and godfather, sent to and partially dedicated to Lord Steiger; for he showed them to me; he will write to you himself and give thanks. As for me, I heard you sent a copy, but I have not yet received it; either it is still on the way or it is being held at Königsfelden. However, I hope to receive it soon, and nonetheless, I now give you many and great thanks. I would very much like you to add Daniel, that wonderful polymath, to Jeremiah, who describes and laments the captivity and what preceded it, through whom God performed such great miracles and oracles during the captivity. Many pious brothers, who also pray to the Lord for your health so that they may enjoy your labors for a long time, desire and request this with me. When you were still young, you provided some example of writings to be published on this prophet as well, when you resolved that disputable knot about his weeks. We therefore hope that now, as an elder, you will present the entire prophet to us.</p>
      <p>I know that you have long since expounded him for public discourse and have collected certain things about him; we have long desired that you make these common to us all through print, and now we also request and demand it. As for other matters, I write some things to my brother, which he will communicate to you.</p>
      <p>I want you to know this one thing, that ministers are being summoned to France by the King of Navarre through a certain nobleman from Geneva and also from our region, and great progress is expected. The day before yesterday, a certain Georg Cornelius, a learned and industrious man, who had served as a minister in Rotulus, was here with that nobleman and sought permission to leave from the senate, and he was entrusted and dismissed with much honor, congratulations, and a very ample testimony of God's grace.</p>
      <p>From this, you can infer what is to be hoped for from France. We are now expecting news from Baden daily.</p>
      <p>Those rotten proposals for peace almost kill me, in which I hear the mass is not once called holy and those who have it are bound not to reject it in the future, even if they are ever enlightened. Our people were gravely offended recently when the departure of the diet was heard.</p>
      <p>The envoys excused themselves rather coldly, saying that they had not advised or imposed this. I wish, I wish that it is not accepted, lest the enemies be given another occasion through these and other works of our imprudence and timidity to mock us, indeed the truth itself.</p>
      <p>It grieves me and troubles honest people's blood to suffer badly, that God gives a good year to the godless. I will expostulate with our envoys as soon as they return; for I only learned of their departure right before they left. I indeed sensed such things from your letters long ago, but I could not read the articles before their departure, and the envoys have cleverly concealed these things until now. If the matter is still to be advised and helped by yours, then do it; we will also do our best here.</p>
      <p>I commend you to the Lord with all yours, whom you will greet in my name. Your father-in-law, Zehender, Fellenberg, Musculus, and all friends and brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 13, 1561.</p>
      <p>Your H[aller].</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church in Zürich, his honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
