    <p xml:id="regest1">Frölich apologizes for his late response to Bullinger's letter [not received]. To take care of himself, Bullinger should not write so many and such long letters to Frölich and his peers anymore.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The unwavering friendship between Bullinger and Frölich will endure beyond death. For Bullinger's writing "Resurrectio" has reduced Frölich's fear of death and filled him with the confidence that he will one day meet all the redeemed again.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Through the excellent work of Johannes Haller in Augsburg, the sympathy of the Augsburg council for Bullinger grows daily.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Frölich has been able to secure a position in Augsburg for Thomas Naogeorg, the learned author of "Pammachius". He does not get along with the Lutherans in Kahla.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- [Wolfgang] Musculus is slowly coming to his senses, as he had to realize that [Johannes] Cochläus and other readers mistakenly understood the passage about the Lord's Supper in his commentary on Matthew as corresponding to the papal doctrine.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- The annulment of the trial against the fratricide Alfonso Diaz and his accomplice [Juan Prieto] ordered by Emperor [Charles V] and King [Ferdinand I] is a clear expression of the evil intentions of the opponents. They are already gathering troops in [Spain] and Lower Germany. The war will probably break out this year. Should it come to that, the [Augsburgers] will ask the Confederates for help.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- There are still some princes and "theologasters" who, like [Judas] Iscariot, are ready to betray the truth, insisting on a [religious] conversation!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Frölich's family and his wife [Anna, née Lochner] would like to express their sympathy for Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] and children and will express it more clearly soon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Frölich is feeling somewhat better. Official duties and the summer heat prevent him from the planned trip to the baths [of Baden]. However, he would be ready to arrange a visit from Bullinger and Rudolf Gwalther to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- He would like to see a copy of Bullinger's letter to Melanchthon [HBBW XVI, No. 2404]. Recently, he also pleaded with a letter to him for the settlement of the [inner-Protestant] disputes. He would share any response.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- It is good that [Theodor Bibliander] has abandoned his dangerous travel plan. He should bury it completely!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Had the princes enforced their absence from the Imperial Diet in Regensburg, they would have contributed more to the peace of the fatherland. Unfortunately, they are being recruited through intrigues. Thus, Moritz of Saxony, son-in-law of the Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse], who has already arrived in Regensburg, is being brought to eagerly advocate for the release of the Duke [Heinrich] of Brunswick, which will lead to tensions between Moritz and the Landgrave.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Also traveling to Regensburg are Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria, Duke Erich [II] of Brunswick, the bishops of Würzburg [Melchior Zobel], Bamberg [Weigand of Redwitz], Eichstätt [Moritz of Hutten], and Augsburg [Cardinal Otto Truchsess of Waldburg] as well as King Ferdinand and many [priests]. However, the Imperial Diet has not yet begun. Hopefully, the Landgrave and the Elector [Johann Friedrich] of Saxony will not participate.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">- At the last [Schmalkaldic League meeting] in Worms, the league could not be extended due to insufficient participation. However, since everyone has declared their willingness in writing, it is as if it has been extended. Moreover, according to the old resolutions, every ally is obliged to participate in the settlement of the ongoing conflicts until the end. However, since the matters of the Brunswick trade, the Imperial Chamber Court, and a general council are still open, the league cannot be dissolved. The extension of the league will not be addressed during the upcoming [Regensburg] Imperial Diet for compelling reasons but at a later date.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">- [Colonel] Sebastian Schertlin now has a pastor [Hans Hilbert], with whom he is courageously implementing the [introduction of the Reformation in Burtenbach]. Some nobles from the Margraviate of Burgau are following his example, even if reprisals from the Emperor and King are to be expected.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">- Hans Wilpert Zoller’s good behavior pleases everyone, including Schertlin.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">- Greetings to the mayors [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Johannes Haab], to the city clerk [Hans Escher vom Luchs], and to all scholars.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest18">- Frölich has given the beautifully bound collection [of Bullinger's writings] he received from him to Hans Jakob Fugger, where the book will be of use. Bullinger should therefore send the three texts not available in [Augsburg] again for payment.</p>

    <div xml:id="div1" corresp="regest1">
      <p>Greetings. I confess, Bullinger, that a large part of my life has been marked by tardiness and laziness in responding to your most friendly letters, and I beg your pardon for my fault. I easily believe that you were very busy explaining the Lord's Passion before the Easter holidays and celebrating the Lord's Supper, and it is no wonder if you exhaust and weaken your body with labors. Therefore, I advise and urge you not to trouble and exhaust yourself too much by writing so many and such lengthy letters to me and those like me. However, if it pleases you to greet Laetus, do so as briefly as possible, even in a laconic manner.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>As you write, our friendship, once established, will remain immovable and perpetual. It will indeed stand, and not even death itself will separate us. Rather, this natural death will present us with a supernatural bond of friendship in the heavenly homeland! I have now finally drawn and fully understood this magnificent hope and consolation, previously little known to me, from your precious booklet on the resurrection of Christ and eternal life! Hence, my spirit is so uplifted that I not only fear death less but also find it most delightful to be with Christ and His elect whenever I am called, where we will see each other face to face.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>The inclination of our most honorable council towards you will never diminish, but rather increase more and more every day. For we have your example and image, Johannes Haller, before our eyes daily; indeed, an excellent man. He and your divine services bestowed upon us will never allow us to forget our Bullinger.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Thomas Naogeorgus, the author of "Pammachius," a man learned in Greek and Latin, a perceptive and eloquent theologian, wrote to me these days that he agrees with nothing among the Lutherans, among whom he now acts as bishop in Kahla; therefore, he has entirely decided to migrate here to us. Upon hearing this, I immediately obtained a place for him from our magistrate; if we secure him, we will more easily resist the papacy and Lutheranism.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Musculus is beginning to return to the right path a little. For he admits that Cochläus and the others have wrongly approved and understood his writings on the Eucharist in Matthew in a papist manner; this troubles the man, and I do not believe it is far off that he will regret that writing.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Alfonso Diaz and his servant, the fratricide, are still held captive in Innsbruck, but by the orders of the Emperor and King, all law and justice against them have been removed. We are indeed deluded, or rather, we are blinder than moles if we do not see the malice of our adversaries against us with such clear evidence. But do we not see it? Armies are now being gathered among the Celts and in Lower Germany, and we still believe that the matter will be resolved by arms this year. May the Lord grant success! If we reach such afflictions, we will both implore and expect the help of the Swiss, for otherwise, we will not be sufficiently equipped to advance into battle.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>There are still princes and theologians who insist on a colloquium (I would rather say a vain talk). O miserable theologasters! I certainly fear greatly that they would gladly betray the truth, provided there is a buyer. O most wicked Iscariots! May the Lord visit them as they deserve.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>My wife and household sincerely love your honorable wife and children; my wife will testify to this more clearly in the future.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>My poor health has somewhat ceased, and I have begun to feel better through that heavenly and unique physician. I intended to visit the baths, but the affairs of the republic and the now approaching summer heat keep me at home. I would very much like to see you and my Rudolf Gwalther here. It could indeed happen that I would lead you home. Therefore, consider this matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>I hope to see what you once wrote to Philipp through a copy. A few days ago, I also wrote something to him, advising him on settling disputes. If he replies, I will share his thoughts with you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>I was very pleased to learn that a certain excellent man has changed his mind about a dangerous journey. Make sure he buries those thoughts as well. Why would we want to hide such a treasure of intellect in an inaccessible field?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>I cannot write anything good about the Imperial Diet in Regensburg. I would have liked the princes' counsel, that they intended not to attend this diet at all, and I do not doubt that if they had firmly adhered to it, we would have brought more peace and prosperity to the fatherland. But the intrigue and deceit, as well as the instability, are so great that some princes allow themselves to be swayed. Duke Moritz of Saxony, the son-in-law of the Landgrave, is already in Regensburg and is being led to eagerly advocate for the release of the imprisoned tyrant of Brunswick; this has been orchestrated by the adversaries alone to create discord between the Landgrave and Duke Moritz and to incite them against each other.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Duke Wilhelm of Bavaria, Duke Erich of Brunswick, the bishops of Würzburg, Bamberg, Eichstätt, Augsburg, and many of the clergy have also arrived, as well as King Ferdinand. However, the Imperial Diet and proceedings have not yet begun. I cannot think otherwise than that all unrest will result from it. I hope the Landgrave and the Elector of Saxony will not be moved to participate on the mentioned day. But if it happens, it is not good.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>At the recent meeting in Worms, so few of the estates appeared that the extension of the league could not be accomplished. However, everyone has declared in writing, and it is no less to me than if everything had been carried out. And even if no further agreement should occur, the old letters and seals still oblige every estate to be bound by their honor and oaths to help bring the begun matters to an end, no less or otherwise than if the league were still in effect. Thus, we have the Brunswick war, the recusation of the Imperial Chamber Court, the councils, and the entire religion, none of which have been resolved. Therefore, we cannot leave each other. We will not deal with the extension of the league at this Imperial Diet for compelling reasons, but will hold a special day for it soon after.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Mr. Sebastian Schertlin has obtained a pastor and is courageously addressing the matter. Some nobles in the Margraviate of Burgau are following his example. It is indeed dangerous in the presence of the Emperor and King, but one must obey God more than men.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>Hans Hilpert Zoller conducts himself modestly, honestly, decently, and well. As a result, he has honor and praise from Mr. Schertlin and everyone. Indeed, say that I have a special heart with all joy for him, and if I could serve him with honor and pleasure, nothing would hinder me from doing so. The mayors, city clerk, and all scholars, whom you hold in the highest regard, send their most friendly greetings.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div17" corresp="regest17">
      <p>Your little book, which you offered to me, beautifully bound, has been received by Mr. Hans Jakob Fugger from me. You need not demand it back from him, for it will be of use. But I ask you to let me buy the three materials again and send them here. I cannot obtain them here. I will pay for them faithfully.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div18" corresp="regest18">
      <p>Given on June 3, 1546.</p>
      <p>Your faithful willing brother Georg Frölich, called Laetus, city clerk in Augsburg.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant overseer of the Church of Zurich, most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
