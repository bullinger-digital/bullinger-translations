      <p>Often indeed I have tried to write to you, Bullinger, most excellent in piety and learning; but until now, it has always been more the occasion than the will that was lacking. Now, when my cousin here, Johannes Götz, son of Paul Götz, formerly a most renowned doctor and professor here with us, was returning to you there, I could not omit, in my zeal towards those who think rightly and who walk uprightly towards the truth, to greet you with a single word and to encourage you to strive so that the last act of your life, like that of a good play, may be as excellent and beneficial to the Christian republic as possible, so that the people of your nation may finally come together into one fold through your work and with one voice and consent recognize Christ, our only mediator, and that other people may also be deterred from the miserable storm and French slaughter, so that the planting of heaven and the most joyful message may finally be propagated peacefully and safely. I am fully convinced that you do not wish otherwise, and I have no doubt about a happy outcome; for God is not unjust to forget your work. But I act foolishly, as a young man teaching an old man, a proselyte teaching a doctor, indeed a pig teaching Minerva; therefore, forgive me. There is one thing I ask of you, that you promote this cousin of mine, wherever you can honorably, a man by nature not at all evil and simple, but pious, in my name and in the name of his common friends, indeed in the name of Christ the Lord, so that he may understand that this recommendation of mine has been of great use to him.</p>
      <p>Finally, greet Otto Werdmüller (if he is still among the living) and Rudolf Gwalther, whose learned ethical and anti-Antichrist works I greatly delight in, in my name. May God, the best and greatest, wish that you all remain with us as long and as happily as possible.</p>
      <p>Given in Freiburg im Breisgau on the day before the Kalends of September in the year of Christ 1571.</p>
      <p>Yours as his own son, Johannes Thomas Freigius, Doctor of Law and political professor in this academy.</p>
      <p>Please, most illustrious man, either destroy this letter or take care that it does not harm me; you know what it is like to be a rose among thorns.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and vigilant bishop of the Church of Zürich, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his most venerable lord.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
      <p>Dr. Johannes Thomas Freigius, political professor of Freiburg im Breisgau.</p>
