      <p>Our friendly greetings, willing service along with whatever we honor, love, and good fortune can provide at all times, worthy, highly learned, especially gracious, wise lord and special good friend.</p>
      <p>We do not doubt that your wisdom is well informed, how God the Almighty, our creator and redeemer, has called the worthy, well-learned, our Christian leader of our church here, Mr. Jacob FÃ¼ncklin (recently deceased) from this vale of tears to his eternal joy and salvation, and yet in such a case we have always kept our comfort and refuge with you, as well as with the worthy, well-learned your fellow brothers and leaders of the church in Zurich, to provide our church with well-learned and Christian leaders, which has always been shown to us by you and demonstrated in action, which we have also enjoyed until now, for which we thank you most highly. And we cannot withhold from you that some preachers have recently reported to Bern and made inquiries, but for many alleged reasons have not been able to obtain anything, which you should not take amiss from us. And so we make our entire dutiful and friendly request to you, for the promotion of God's honor and the planting of His holy word, also in view that your and our church have been uniform in everything from the beginning until now and, God willing, shall remain so at all times, that you would look around for a Christian leader who might lead our church, as we do not doubt, you have well-learned people (thank God) enough with you, and when such a one is found, inform us in writing, also how we should proceed in this matter. Then we will send our council delegation to you in Zurich and, as is appropriate, negotiate and decide with your lords and superiors or with you, so that you will be well satisfied with us. And although we expect all honor and good from you, we ask you for a friendly, willing response, by the bearer of this letter sent for this purpose alone, with the offer that wherever we can earn this from you with body, property, and goods, we will do so at all times with willing inclination, with the help of the Almighty, who will keep you in His protection and care with long-lasting health.</p>
      <p>Dated the 2nd day of February in the year of our Lord 1566. Meiger, mayor and council of the city of Biel.</p>
