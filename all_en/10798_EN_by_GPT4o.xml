      <p>Greetings and peace of conscience through Christ.</p>
      <p>Lord von Fischingen, Heinrich Stoll, my relative, today after the public sermon approached me at home, sought a private conversation, and announced the death of Hans Bosshart, a good man, the pastor in Oberwinterthur, whose position I understand he, along with many others, is aspiring to. He pleads with me and earnestly requests that I recommend him to you. Since I see that he is fully convinced that he will obtain what he seeks with no effort if he perceives your favor in this matter, you have given me a task which I could not refuse; for I had to comply with a friend. You will consider what you think is most appropriate to do. The man is otherwise good, if I am not mistaken, and pious, not improperly learned in sacred matters, to whom I could safely entrust the pastoral duty without offending my conscience, whom I truly do not believe would aim at anything other than solely advancing the glory of our God. He will have many competitors; may they strive for a noble work rather than a noble income! As for what should further be written about the man's status and his affairs, in what condition they are placed and how the income is cut off, which is not sufficient to support his family, you may perhaps learn from his brothers, whom he has in the Small Council of Zurich, distinguished men; for they will be able to explain the reason for his ambition and everything that might be useful for you to know better in person than I can describe in many letters, nor is there time at present to deal with more due to the hurried and sudden departure of the messenger.</p>
      <p>Last year you said you were contemplating a book on free will and thus on fate itself and God's providence. I hear it is written, and you still suppress it. I urge you, do not delay any longer, I ask, to provide all good and pious people with such a useful and necessary book. Nor should you think there is anything to deter you from publishing this book; for all those you have published so far are said to be in everyone's hands, even some that have already lost the charm of novelty, unless the booksellers are flattering our ears. But indeed, let them flatter, as long as our studies are promoted through you!</p>
      <p>Farewell and stay healthy. Regarding the Bernese expedition, if you have any certain information, please inform me with letters, however brief, I beg and implore you again and again.</p>
      <p>The eighth day before the Ides of March in the year 1536.</p>
      <p>H. LÃ¼thi, yours as his own.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in exceptional piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, first minister of the church of Zurich and his most esteemed brother.</p>
