    <p xml:id="regest1">If Bullinger is satisfied with the [enclosed] notes on [two] castles [in Aargau] delivered by the Aarau bookseller [Hans Stuber], Gabriel Meyer will send further notes on the castles mentioned at the end of the transmitted notes. Otherwise, Bullinger should return the work and communicate his wishes. Meyer would be willing to visit the owners of the castles to obtain detailed information from them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Hochholzer will return Bullinger's notes on [Theodor Bibliander's] Genesis [lectures] in a few days.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- The nasty joke that Heinrich Lochmann allowed himself to the detriment of [Zurich] and about which Hochholzer recently wrote [No. 2410], was no trifle. For even if Lochmann now says it was a joke, he had nevertheless gained some advantages from his all too convincingly presented claim [at that time]. It would therefore be good if the [Zurich] council would refute Lochmann's false statement with a letter addressed to the Aarau council, even though the people of Aarau meanwhile believe Hochholzer, especially since Lochmann himself has corrected the claim he made. However, there is a danger that some good-for-nothings will continue to try to spread the rumor, especially since it is considered a guaranteed message by some [Aarauers]. Hochholzer already knows that Bullinger and the mayor [Hans Rudolf Lavater] do not need his advice. He only wants to say that the good reputation of [Zurich] is also close to his heart and that he knows the disposition of the sons of Belial [the devil] all too well.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Today a song about the Lord's Supper reached [Aarau], written by [Peter Zeller], who is studying with [Thomas] Grynäus in Bern. Those who deny that the body of Christ is taken in the Lord's Supper are insulted in it as fanatics, devils, and madmen, and even accused of not even believing in the first article of the [Apostolic] Creed! The [“Orthodoxa Tigurinae ecclesiae confessio”] is also alluded to there. And the deluded [Bernese] council tolerates such a thing! Where will it lead if not only foreigners [Germans] but now also locals act with impunity! This will trigger an internal conflict among the [Protestant Confederates]. Unfortunately, due to lack of time, Hochholzer could not copy and send the song, otherwise Bullinger could have seen for himself how Luther now continues to live in Bern among vile people.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Hochholzer's wife [Agathe, née Näf] sends her regards to the whole family.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Our bookseller, esteemed lord, Mr. Gabriel Meyer, sends some brief notes on one castle and another, as you requested. Being busy with other matters, he could not do more at this time. If you see these and they please you, he promises his assistance with the rest. He sends these for you to review, to see if they please you or not, or if you desire anything else in them, to mark and return them to us. If you wish, you will have similar brevity on the others, whose names he has added at the end. If you wish them to be treated differently, you will indicate this in writing. However, time will be needed. He knows most of them, but he does not dare to commit them to writing; but he will inquire more diligently from the current owners if you wish. He himself will, if it pleases you, go to the castles and learn everything possible firsthand. Therefore, write what you wish to be done. He would have written to you himself, but he said he was hindered by business. He asked me to write to you in this sense, which I have done willingly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The notes you gave on Genesis, within two or three days, if a certain messenger is given, I will return to you. There remain a few things still to be excerpted.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, as I recently wrote, regarding the speech made in jest by Heinrich Lochmann, which was too rashly spread to the disgrace and dishonor not only of our city but also of religion, I think you have understood well enough. Nor should you think that I have reported to you things of no importance. For he had affirmed it too confidently, even adding some advantages that had arisen from it, although he now wishes it to be considered a joke. Our people now know that the slander was futile. In the meantime, however, as far as I can judge, it would be very beneficial if your council wrote to ours and excused themselves in writing. They now believe me, since he himself has retracted. But the council's letter would testify to their zeal not only in punishing crimes and wickedness but also in refuting false rumors spread about them in such matters; furthermore, such worthless people would not henceforth utter anything they please, even if they thought about the destruction of laws and all decency, they would not publicize their desires as if they were facts. Moreover, others, being warned, would be less inclined to believe such rumors. I know as surely as anyone that it has already been spread as a certainty by our people. I do not write this because I think that either you or the most prudent and honorable consul do not consider these things, but because it is fitting for me to protect the reputation of my country, to avert disgrace and dishonor as much as possible, and because I know the disposition of some people, sons of Belial, who take pleasure in spreading such things. Therefore, I ask you to receive these words in the spirit in which I write them and to do what seems most advisable to you, and to hold me in your esteem.</p>

      <p>Today a song was brought to us from Bern by a certain Bernese student, composed under the discipline of Grynaeus in Bern, which, as these triflers are wont to do, deals with the matter of the Eucharist. It calls all those who deny that the body of Christ is taken in the Lord's Supper fanatics and diabolical, and cites the apology or response of the Zurichers, although it does not name them, yet in such a way that anyone can understand. It calls them fanatics and madmen who dare to affirm that they believe all the articles of faith, when they do not even believe the first one, etc. Such is the blindness of the council that they tolerate this! See, I ask you, to what it has come, that not foreigners, not outsiders, but our own, and the most contemptible people, do this with impunity. In the end, it will lead to a great persecution of one party or the other. For these things cannot be endured for long, indeed God will not endure them. I would have sent it, not because it is something new, but so that you could see for yourself how Luther now lives in Bern among the vilest people; but I could not reply so quickly. The Lord will finally cleanse His threshing floor. May He deal with us according to His abundant mercy! Amen.</p>
