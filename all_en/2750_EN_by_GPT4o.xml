      <p>Greetings. The plague has not left us, even if it is not raging; for it occasionally invades homes anew. Every week one or two people die; in some neighboring villages, it is a bit more severe. Our people are again allowed to preach and wander about with their own concerns. If you hear him speaking, especially about ancient matters, you would swear there is nothing more fitting and of such present counsel; if you hear him preach three times, you will wonder how he is not the same. May the Lord help his people and grant that we all speak what is necessary and serious. - All cattle and foodstuffs from our Confederation have been taken to Italy; those that were for sale, even if not sold dearly. From Italy, we hear for certain this: the King of the French has again begun to take some towns that surrendered without much resistance; Ulpianum (Ulpian) is said to have been leveled to the ground, indeed the stronger fortresses and walls, so that nothing may be feared from them in the future at Turin. However, he hopes that many, driven by the necessity of famine, will come into his power in the coming weeks. - The plague has long reigned in Padua, about which it is written to someone here as nothing less than uncertain: There was a certain monk there, who was added as a confessor to the sick, who was hanged along with his servant and some doctors of his kind.</p>
      <p>For their conspiracy, wickedness, and horrendous robberies were discovered. The monk, in confession, would probe what each person had and where it was hidden; then, if they saw that the wealthier ones who had confessed were not going to die, those doctors would cut out the plague with knives, burn it with fire, and under the pretense of healing, they would torture and kill the wretched in horrendous ways.</p>
      <p>Not a few, impatient with medicine and pain, would throw themselves alive into the waters. If there were any in the houses whom they saw untouched by the plague, they would give them potions in which there was a powder of blood, which they had collected from the wounds of the excised plague, as I said, so that no survivors would report to the rest of the mortals what they had seen done by the conspirators; for they abused women of all kinds and children according to their lust. Do you want to hear how it became known? There was a certain leader in the city, whom they knew to be wealthy. He allowed none of his people ever to leave the house, nor did he allow anyone from outside to enter, and they were completely immune from the plague, to the great pain of the conspirators.</p>
      <p>Their servant, having communicated with his people, threw two very elegant handkerchiefs in a marvelous way into the leader's house. A certain girl of the house found them; she saw they were elegant and took them for herself; the next day she felt the plague. The leader, amazed at how this had happened, questioned the family;...</p>
      <p>[...] he found out about the girl, as I have already said. Immediately he became suspicious and began to think ill of the monk. He approached his superior; he obtained permission to capture the monk's servant. He ordered the monk's servant to be brought to him; he immediately rushed in, singing to himself that joyful tune: "The prey sought has fallen into my nets." But immediately, as he entered the house, he was captured. He was tortured; he confessed to a sea of evils. In short, the monk was captured, the doctors were captured. Everything was revealed, an incredible amount of money was found, golden cups, and an immense treasure of such precious things, which those robbers had gathered to soon divide among themselves. They were executed on the cross. Thus, the horrendous judgment of God is evident in that city; the monastic integrity and sanctity are known. Now receive the treachery of the Greeks and learn from one crime about all. I will make an end. These things are written simply (you know my simplicity) and faithfully; may your ears take them well. Farewell in the Lord, most excellent of men, and do not cease to love your Philippus. Comander Tschernerus and Traversus, who recently gave me this message, greet you, I say the younger.</p>
      <p>From Chur, on the 14th of October in the year 1555.</p>
      <p>Of your kindness, Gallicius.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord in all good things.</p>
