      <p> Greetings. Recently, I, your honorable godfather, outlined the petition of the people of Schwyz to you in a letter, along with our so-called double council's decision on the French expedition. I hope these have reached you and that you have been relieved from the concern in which you, along with many good men of our land, were placed; for we feared that they, as they were accustomed to doing in previous disputes, would propose something about religion or ceremonies, from which new tumults would arise. But nothing of the sort happened; instead, as I said, they only brought up certain political matters. I have shown your advice, which I am sending back to you, to some prudent men, especially our bailiff, who all admire your care for us and are very grateful to you, and they ask that you continue to be so towards them in the future. The sad news from Belgium and France affects us all more and more. May God, the eternal Father, who arranges everything rightly, finally liberate His own and confound and suppress this tyranny. If only we could learn wisdom from their misfortune; but oh, how cowardly we are. Hence, I have no doubt that He will awaken us, who are slumbering and wallowing in our sins and feeling secure, to our great detriment, and will finally punish us most severely. If a clearer account or tragedy from France arrives, please share it with me, so that I can show it to those who make light of that nefarious deed and even try to obscure it among others, saying it was not as bad as it is made out to be; people exaggerate the matter; the story comes from Zurich; from France, one would hear differently, etc. But these things are usually spread here and there in our valleys by those who wish for the expedition requested by the king to be granted; for they know that our community is almost furious against the king himself and against all those who have committed such robbery. Therefore, they are so diligently watching to see if they can persuade people that the matter is not so cruel and that it has been exaggerated by some vain people, etc. These things I wanted to briefly inform you of, my lord and honorable godfather; I ask that you take it in good part. </p>
      <p> The bailiff, treasurer, Beldii, Avienus, and the rest send you their greetings and wish you a long life and good health. My wife and my entire household also wish you well. </p>
      <p> Hastily from Glarus, November 5, 1572. Johannes Hugo, yours sincerely. </p>
      <p> To the pious, honorable, well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossm√ºnster in Zurich, my faithful, dear lord and godfather, to your hands. </p>
      <p> Zurich. </p>
