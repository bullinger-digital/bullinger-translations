      <p>As it seems to me, dearest compater, just as it does to you, that as much as possible, we should abstain from the company of such men. In Basel, he caused quite a disturbance and could not defend the doctrines he professed through debate. Then, as you yourself said, if he teaches in Lausanne, the discord between the Bernese and the Genevans will greatly intensify. But if it cannot be avoided that he is received, a confession must be demanded from him that is clear, transparent, and open, especially on those points for which he is under suspicion. First, let his annotations on the chapter to the Romans be read, which the people of Basel wanted to be expunged and did not allow to be included in books sold thereafter. There he states that all men are predestined to eternal life.</p>
      <p>He also wants many things to be done against God's predestination. He attributes more than is due to free will.</p>
      <p>All these things should be carefully considered both there and elsewhere in his annotations.</p>
      <p>In the second epistle to the Corinthians, chapter 10, he makes faith and religion so free that he seems to want almost nothing to be able to be established against heretics. It is said that he does not think rightly about justification by faith alone.</p>
      <p>It is also preached that he teaches that such perfection can be obtained in this life that we satisfy God's law with our works.</p>
