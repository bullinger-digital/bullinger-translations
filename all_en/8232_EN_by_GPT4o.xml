      <p>S. D. I truly wonder why it is that you have very rarely and for several fairs now sent me no letters; you cannot say that you are lacking in topics or material, since every single day the affairs of the Venetians and the Turks, and finally Italy, provide an abundance of material. Therefore, see to it, my dear Tobias, that you cannot be accused of laziness. By the grace of God, our affairs are prosperous; may the Lord continue to bless us and protect both us and you from all evil! A few of our people have gone to that unfortunate military service. The Bernese have intercepted over 100 of their own and ordered them to be brought in chains to public trials.</p>
      <p>It is to be feared that some of them will have to be executed. From France, it is reported, though I do not know how reliably, that the king has hastened with the largest cannons to besiege the city of Chartres, which is held by the Admiral's forces; in turn, the Admiral's forces are hastening to lift that siege. If these things are true, there will undoubtedly be fighting again, and I fear the last Confederates are summoned to the church assembly. Disperse, O Lord, the nation that desires war! In England, there was a great tumult. The Papists broke the Lord's tables, tore up the Bibles, and trampled them underfoot insolently, celebrated masses, afflicted the evangelicals, and had the crucifix, images of Mary and the saints as if they were tutelary gods painted on their military banners, and faithfully served the Antichrist. But the most serene queen, having sent her troops against those blasphemous idolaters, routed and put them to flight, capturing their principal leaders, while some fled to Scotland, where they were also captured. Now there is talk of taking punitive measures against the rebels. Meanwhile, through treachery, the governor of Scotland was shot and killed with a gun. Everything is now pacified again in England. This was written to me in February from England, from London, and it is certain. The Papists have been dealt a blow there.</p>
      <p>In Heidelberg, preparations are being made for the marriage of Prince Johann Casimir with the daughter of the Elector of Saxony; it will be celebrated on June 4th. The Emperor has convened an imperial diet for Trinity Sunday in Speyer.</p>
      <p>He will pass through Nuremberg, where marvelous preparations are being made for his arrival. Many expect nothing good from that diet.</p>
      <p>I pray you will kindly greet the honorable councilors, Mr. Karl, and all our other colleagues in order. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, April 7, 1570.</p>
      <p>May you be safe with your entire household.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, brother and beloved fellow minister.</p>
      <p>Chur.</p>
