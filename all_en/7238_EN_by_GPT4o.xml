      <p>What I have long promised you, most learned Bullinger, I now wish to fulfill. I am sending to you and to Mr. Simler a Latin document written by me, if indeed these things ought or can be written in Latin, originating from the workshop of the ancient enemies of the church of God, than which I have never read anything more insulting to the eternal Son of God; for they strip him of all divinity and make him similar to us. Unless you, the pastors and guardians of God's church, address this intolerable impiety with true light, there is a fear that soon a large part of the wheat will turn into tares. For many are very pleased with what is said by these people, but especially the Jews. You see, my father, to what extent these people, who once crossed the boundaries of the orthodox and catholic church, have now advanced in impudence. Since they do not regard it, but interpret the scriptures according to their own judgment, it happens that they increasingly heap lies upon lies with a false understanding of God.</p>
      <p>I believe that Thretium has already departed from Frankfurt, from whom I expect my boy today. Victorinus Strigelius has brought no small ornament to this academy. I also see Zanchus striving to be here, which will soon make the gymnasium more frequented by these two men. The most distressing reports about the state of religion in Belgium are brought to us. They say that the principal counts have been deceived by Spanish cunning and sent to the king. The common people, however, are cruelly slaughtered, and the blood of the pious stains the sea fish. But such rivers must irrigate the paradise of God.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my father. May the Holy Spirit of God govern your mind and fill it with all strength and wisdom! I wish the same for your other colleagues and commend our miserably torn churches to your fervent prayers.</p>
      <p>Heidelberg, 10th day before the Kalends of October 1567. Postscript. I believe that the barrel from Basel has already been lost; for when I asked the Torcisanis, citizens of Nuremberg, they denied having received it. Froschauer should have known the carrier to whom he had given it for transport.</p>
