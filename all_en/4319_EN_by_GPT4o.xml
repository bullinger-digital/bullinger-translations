      <p>To the most distinguished men of sincere piety, evangelical wisdom, and all kinds of integrity, the most vigilant pastors and most eloquent teachers of the Zürich church, and to our entirely truly revered fathers, Heinrich Bullinger and his fellow ministers, all happy increase of grace and peace from God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ. Since a certain woman named Anna Combe, indeed of Aquitanian nation, but who, for the sake of the gospel, has been a refugee from her own people for several years, both in Geneva and in Thonon in the domain of our magnificent lords of Bern, now for several months has been living here in this church of Lausanne, and she has complained to us more than once that her husband, Johannes de Tonet, formerly a canon in the church of Périgueux, deserted her four years ago and moved to your city of Zürich, having changed his appearance and perhaps his name, not only migrated but also took another wife there, whom he nevertheless impiously deserted again as soon as he discovered that his wickedness was being exposed. Therefore, moved by charity towards this woman thus deserted and indeed affected by the desire to remove such scandals, although unknown to you until now and in all ways unequal, we dare to beseech you in the present through the Lord, that you may deign, as soon as it is possible, to inform us about this matter, which has been conducted among you, through some letter of yours, so that the whole case, having been examined back and forth by those whom it concerns, may be better addressed for this miserable woman. If the Almighty ever grants us any kind of office in which we can gratify you, we hope that we will not sluggishly undertake it for your favor. Meanwhile, may that supreme Lord, in whose church you continually minister with such splendid progress, continue to bless you and yours most liberally and preserve you for a very long time for all kinds of edification. Farewell most happily in Him.</p>
      <p>Lausanne, June 18, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted ministers in Christ of the Lausanne church, Richard von Wald, Johannes Boscatius, Jacobus Anglus.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed fathers and lords in the Lord, Heinrich Bullinger and the other pastors of the Zürich church.</p>
