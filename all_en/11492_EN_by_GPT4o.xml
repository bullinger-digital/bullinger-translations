      <p>The letters of the others are so worn and eroded that no suitable sense could be comprehended by examining them. And if only there were someone who could adapt them to histories and the emblems of these and others! For no one can doubt that great light could flow into literary matters from this and many of the most obscure passages of the best writers could be explained and illustrated. But this matter requires more leisure than you might think I have. Indeed, it is so: the intention was to handle something like this; but the highest magistracy offered by the citizens recalled the plan, by which I am so occupied with various and very serious duties that I am not even allowed to visit books, let alone handle and engage with them day and night, as should be done in these studies. Therefore, you will have to find someone else to whom you can delegate this task. Farewell, most reverend man.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, 13th of July, in the year 1530.</p>
