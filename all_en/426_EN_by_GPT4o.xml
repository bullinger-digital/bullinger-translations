      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Our dean, my colleague Zender, has been held by a severe illness continuously since the first of January just past, so that sometimes it seems to be a fever, sometimes a royal disease, so that sometimes he seems about to die suddenly. He has used the advice of doctors, two of whom advise that he acquire and use the things you see in this schedule attached to these letters. He used some things a month ago and moderately recovered for several days, but in these days he has become so weak that today he is placed in the very danger of death.</p>
      <p>Added to this is the illness of his wife Barbara, who is also bedridden. Therefore, our dean and I, on his behalf, ask as much as possible that you would be willing to endure a little labor and trouble on his behalf, to approach a skilled and trustworthy apothecary with this messenger, who brings you these letters, and ensure that he can have those things contained in this attached schedule, not adulterated or corrupted, but genuine and fresh. If it will be possible, he will be very grateful to repay you at some time. In this, you will also do me a most pleasing favor.</p>
      <p>Indeed, the danger of death threatens both; but I do not think many words are needed, since I know you will willingly perform this duty for both Mr. Zender and me. Time does not allow for more, as at this very moment the messenger is to be sent off as quickly as possible. I have not received anything from you for a long time; I have been truly anxious until now, lest you too might be unwell or consumed by many labors.</p>
      <p>My wife gave birth to a son for me 14 days ago. I wish your entire household well. Farewell and love me, as you are accustomed, and keep me in your thoughts.</p>
      <p>Aarau, 5th of February, in the year of salvation 1549. Entirely yours in kindness, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
