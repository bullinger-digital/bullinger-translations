      <p>Greetings, my venerable and dearest Bullinger. You are receiving my letter later than usual because there was nothing for which I should have interrupted your studies and most holy labors in the Lord. I am exceedingly grateful to you for the letter and the response to the question I posed; for although I was indeed of the same opinion as you wrote and did not hesitate at all in this matter so clear, I nevertheless wanted to make it more acceptable to some others, to whom the matter did not seem as clear, by having it confirmed by your judgment as well.</p>
      <p>I remember reading your agreement with the most pious and learned man, Johannes Calvin, written in your own hand a few months ago, and then writing to you about what I thought of it. It seems to me that it does not differ at all from what this excellent servant of Jesus Christ has written elsewhere on this matter most copiously, and would that, as it is, all here might understand it simply, believe it piously, and confess it openly!</p>
      <p>I am very grateful to you for wishing to share with me those three letters, which I return to you in good faith; for their reading was most delightful to me, not only because of the various matters they contain but also because of the spirit of the writers, which seems to me to be entirely imbued with the spirit of Christ, even though they simultaneously recount some sad things, as the affairs of all mortals are perpetually sprinkled with them.</p>
      <p>Our Bucer, a minister of the gospel of Christ not to be regretted, was also followed the day before yesterday by that most eminent and incomparable Swiss, Joachim Vadian, for which I think we should be all the more grateful, the less there is now in this most deplorable world, why it should please anyone with a little more sense to live longer. May our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, who has chosen us from the world, also soon deliver us from its wickedness and impiety and happily bring us into His heavenly kingdom, where there is supreme tranquility and perpetual peace. In Him, with your whole household, may you always fare well, ever mindful of us in your sacred and fervent prayers.</p>
      <p>May all the brothers and friends greet you and commend me constantly to Christ. Farewell again and again. April 9, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your A. B.</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger.</p>
