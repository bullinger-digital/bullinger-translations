      <p>Greetings. Since I know that the state of our city is of no less concern to you, venerable brother, as if you were in my place, and that the renewal of the alliance with the Bernese is particularly dear to your heart, there is no need for me to labor more diligently in recommending this cause, which you would willingly undertake yourself. Since my return, our people's spirits have been frequently agitated by certain offenses, so that there has been no small amount of work in either placating or restraining them.</p>
      <p>However, when they were reminded that if they offered themselves again to renew the alliance, the opposing party's spirits would be somewhat more inclined towards fairness than before, they attempted to understand what this meant. This delegation received no response. I do not need to say how much the indignity of this insult offended our people. Certainly, the fear of enduring rejection in the future deters them, so that no other course remains except that another delegation from you should be sent not only to Bern but also here, to encourage both senates, and also our people, if necessary, to re-enter the alliance on fair terms. Since I am convinced that this is beneficial for our people, they indeed wish for it but would prefer their requests to be covered in silence, with the three cities being led more by goodwill and zeal from both parties to send delegates. If this is achieved, which I hope will not be difficult, our neighbors might be ashamed to concede nothing. Indeed, unless I am mistaken, they are eager to be asked. And the care of this matter affects me more because I suspect that some are being tempted by allurements to seek a common alliance, which I judge to be harmful for us to be involved in. And certainly, our senate is averse to it: however, it is better to prevent the door from being opened to uncertain matters. To keep the matter more secret, we have chosen this excellent brother, who is one of my colleagues, to approach you directly, and then to consult with Habu. Although the letter is written by the mandate of the senate, only four of us are aware of the messenger. Indeed, only eight know what the letter contains, to whom the task is assigned. The matter indeed demands that I urge you more strongly, but since I am not unaware of how willing you are, I do not labor in a superfluous matter.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Italian I inquired about, since it has not been convenient until now, you will now inform me. Regarding the Greek concordances of the Old Testament, which you wish for, as I understand from your letters to our senate's scribe, I would also be very pleased. But as far as I can guess, it is unlikely that our Robert will be persuaded to undertake this work, who, with great diligence and not without expense, has collected the concordances of the New Testament, yet has suppressed them for a whole year and a half, and does not seem to be preparing for publication.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man and brother, whom I sincerely respect. May the Lord protect you and your family and enrich you with every kind of blessing. Greet all my fellow ministers and other friends in my name.</p>
      <p>Geneva, 24th of November, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, brother, and fellow minister, to be greatly respected.</p>
