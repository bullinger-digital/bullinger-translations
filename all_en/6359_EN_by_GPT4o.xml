      <p>Greetings. Reverend Father in Christ, I recently wrote at length and hope my letters have reached you.</p>
      <p>Siderhar has been handled in no other way than by clarifying certain articles on both sides.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, they sealed here, wanted messengers who would ride to France with other Confederates, also to seal there and take a letter.</p>
      <p>Regarding religion, it has come to the point that the French lords were sent to the town hall, where it was presented to them that if unrest concerning religion were to arise in France shortly or in the long term, and if the peace established were not maintained, then our people would not be bound to the king.</p>
      <p>To this, the lord legate answered in such a way: he was of the comforting assurance that it would never come to that in Gaul, but he would write all this to his king with loyalty.</p>
      <p>It remained with such a protestation. If I had not insisted strongly, as Balingket himself knows, not even this would have been done; for religion is not equally a concern for everyone, as it should be.</p>
      <p>The remaining grievances and reservations still concern the battle of Sene and some payments; nothing particularly noteworthy.</p>
      <p>How it will now stand and proceed, one cannot yet know. In many communities, there is unrest.</p>
      <p>If the French lord is to smooth everything out, it will still cost a lot of money; but he is tired of spending, and nothing is done in vain. What other actions there are, Mr. Balingket can report to you well; for he himself has seen and heard much; concerning many matters, I have also reported. - As far as the Spanish lord is concerned, it stands thus: When he rode away from Chur, he stayed a day at Thusis, where he then conducted his practice most strongly; from there, on the 14th of this month, he sent the lords, the envoys, gathered here in Chur at an open assembly, a whole booklet, about 6 or 7 sheets, signed with his own hand and sealed, etc., which I have read and understood at length. It is a brief summary of all his actions as long as he has been in these lands; he recounts at length the benefits that could be had from his presence: firstly, one would have such a powerful king as an eternal and constant neighbor, who, although he has behaved neighborly out of innate goodness until now, was not obliged to do so, and may or may not do so in the future.</p>
      <p>Then he recounts the benefits that could be had from the saving of tolls; amounting to tens of thousands of crowns every year, where he does not consider that the French pension yields more; moreover, he also offered to give more pensions.</p>
      <p>Further, he praises the Rhaetians for their strength, manliness, and bravery: they have an enclosed land, straight men, do not always need to look to the Swiss, and can make eternal praise for themselves.</p>
      <p>For even if they march with the Swiss and perform great deeds, they are still the foundation of the Swiss's victory and triumph, which have come to such heights for no other reason than that they are situated near France. Thus, the Rhaetians lie near Italy.</p>
      <p>Everything that his king has turned to the German military so far would now be reserved for the Confederates alone. Great wealth would come into the land; for they would give the highest ranks, captains, lieutenants, ensigns, and other commanding officers, and one cannot say and recount enough the benefits that cannot be replaced with gold in many ways.</p>
      <p>Later in the progress of the writing, he adds this: "If you always have the Confederates as leaders, you will regret it, etc." Thus you see yourself what those men are plotting.</p>
      <p>When he comes to the article concerning the exiles, about which our people complained in the first action and answered that they do not consider those who were expelled for religion as wrongdoers, he takes this with great astonishment; for he says: introducing such disorder (thus he uses a word), they do not understand governance; he indicates that the innovation of religion causes all unrest and discord, as one sees everywhere before one's eyes.</p>
      <p>He concludes thus: if one should punish the wrongdoers, then those who have fallen away from the Catholic Church, the greatest wrongdoers, should be punished justly, and more, with which he disparages our religion, etc. Thus God has willed that the falsehood comes to light so publicly.</p>
      <p>Thus they are not ashamed to disparage those with whom they are in all dealings. Mr. Tscharner said (when the matters were read before the 3 Confederates) in open council, in the presence of the papists: now it is truly praised that the people have no more understanding and thus publicly to understand what we are venturing to them, etc.</p>
      <p>The same was done by others. - The Spaniard has broken up at Thusis, ridden to Oberhalbstein; there we hear since then, he rides home and is very loyal. My lords, the 3 Confederates, have answered him: if something concerns him, he should act formally and behave properly; if something concerns him, he may carry it out at a special assembly. - You have the summary.</p>
      <p>I have read the Spanish writing, and you will read it sometime. There were also some Confederates here, the bailiff of Freiburg and Mr. Landammann BÃ¤ldi and others more, who read this writing. The bailiff of Freiburg returns through you, who can inform your people about this.</p>
      <p>You may inform the councilors (if you wish) of these things and advise them to understand the fuller history from him. But this is the mere summary that I write, and what I have learned; I have read the Spanish writing diligently. - Farewell, reverend Father in Christ, with all yours.</p>
      <p>Chur, the 18th of January, in the year 1565.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and reverend Father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
