    <p xml:id="regest1">Heard with joy about the resolution of the dispute among the Bernese pastors, the overcoming of Arianism [at the Lausanne Synod], and the events in England; has nothing to write himself, but expects news from Augsburg and Strasbourg. Asks to prevent Claude [d'Aliod] from visiting Konstanz and to possibly give him half a Gulden, which Zwick will reimburse. Is in a hurry due to the visit of Wolfgang [Wissenburg]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Salvation and peace of Christ.</p>
      <p>Oh God, how much you have cheered me with your letters because of those most fortunate news about the resolved dispute among the Bernese brothers and the extinguished fire of Arianism and that excellent success in England. Eternal thanks be to the Lord, that He always stands by us! You wonder, however, why I have not written to you. But what should I invent, my brother, if there is nothing true at hand? I am not so born to invent. Therefore, bear the silence patiently, until there is some occasion to write, which I now expect from Augsburg and Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>This one thing I now wish, that, if you can, you prevent that Claude of Savoy from coming to us or to other churches of ours; for he will accomplish nothing, except that he will recall former things to memory, so that I believe his coming to us will be less beneficial. If he needs travel money, give him half a Gulden, which I will reimburse.</p>
      <p>These things hastily; for the preacher from Basel, Wolfgang, is with us, with whom I am forced to spend time. More about other things soon.</p>
      <p>Farewell for a very long time with the whole family and all good things.</p>
      <p>June 19, 1537.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To the most vigilant minister of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, and his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
