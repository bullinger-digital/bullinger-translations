      <p>Greetings.</p>
      <p>As I hoped to find Philipp in T端bingen, I set out on the journey, and my hope did not deceive me. I found him engaged by the prince and still working on the cause of reforming the academy in T端bingen. I am now dealing with him on the matter of promoting concord, not hindering it, but concluding it more firmly and surely. When I return home, I will inform you of the rest.</p>
      <p>Farewell with the brothers and lords.</p>
      <p>Given in T端bingen.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zurich, dearest brother.</p>
