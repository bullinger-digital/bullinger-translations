    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Although Myconius sent Johannes Buchter immediately from Basel to his father Heinrich in Zurich, he hears that the son did not find his father alive. This death is a loss for the church and for the many surviving children! May the people of Zurich support the latter!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] How good it is that Haller escaped from hell and returned unharmed from Augsburg to Zurich! For wherever Emperor Charles V is with his Spaniards, all hell breaks loose! May the Swiss guard against this deadly plague (which destroys all good)!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger reports that King Henry II of France is seeking an alliance. With whom, then? Does he perhaps want a new alliance? Myconius thought that the already existing treaty [with the Swiss] would still be valid for a few years after the death of Henry's father, Francis I. Bullinger's assessment, that the Swiss would become mercenaries of the Pope if they allied with France, is completely accurate. The Swiss must prove to be very wise here, and the pious should pray incessantly for them! But what can be expected if the Swiss are not united in the Lord? And if they were, what could they hope for in the face of the ongoing imperial success?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Germany has angered God. The same can be said of the Swiss. They must therefore be prepared for a similar fate! The carelessness is interpreted by the pious as a sign of the coming storm. A letter read to the Basel council six days ago indicates that the Emperor is only waiting for a favorable opportunity to attack the Swiss. Yet no one showed the slightest concern, even though many people are ready to die if only the Swiss do not remain unscathed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Johannes Gast assures once again that he has entrusted the Persius edition to a typesetter named Michael [Martin Stella]. He also reports that in the Five Places someone from Rome [Girolamo Franco?] is recruiting mercenaries for Pope Paul III. However, this news is unverified.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings to Bullinger, his family, and colleagues. Myconius sends back [the enclosures] with thanks. Bullinger should share the noteworthy news conveyed by Haller, especially regarding the Emperor's return to Augsburg. Greetings to Rudolf Gwalther.</p>

      <p>S. Although I sent Buchter immediately, I hear that he did not find his father alive! I grieve for the church and the children, whom I hear are quite many. May the Lord be with them through you.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>And I hear that Haller has returned. It is good that he returned unharmed, having escaped from the Lerna of evils, for where the Emperor is with his Spaniards, there is not only Lerna, but hell itself. Let our people beware, lest the deadly plague, the destruction of all good, come to them as well!</p>

      <p>You write about the Frenchman seeking an alliance. You do not add with whom. Therefore, I do not quite understand what you mean, unless he seeks a new alliance. For I thought that the existing treaty would last for several years after the death of his father. But what follows: "If therefore we join with the Frenchman, we are soldiers of the Pope," declares your mind; and I say: It is necessary for the Swiss to exercise all their strength and wisdom here. Let those who are pious be constant in prayer! For I confess that I do not know what should be done, unless we had hearts united in the Lord. Even if it were so, I still do not know what hope could be conceived in this course of imperial success.</p>

      <p>Germany has angered the Lord; it feels it. We too have angered Him very gravely for many years now. Hence we must fear that we will have a similar outcome. May the evil omen be far away! That security of ours displeases the good. Today is the sixth day since the letters were read in our senate, in which it is clearly written that the Emperor is hindered by nothing against us except opportunity. Almost no one was moved by this even a little! And there are indeed those who would wish to perish, only that we might not be unharmed. Such hatred has scarcely ever existed among men! May the Lord protect His own, as He certainly will. Let us therefore pray without ceasing!</p>

      <p>Gast still asserts that he has given Persius to a certain Michael, a compositor. The same says that in the Five Places there is someone from Rome who seeks soldiers in the name of the Pope. Whether this is so, I do not know.</p>

      <p>Farewell in Christ with your family and brothers. Basel, October 20, 1547. I return yours, and give the greatest thanks. If you receive anything worthy of narration from Haller, especially about the return of the Emperor, share it! Greet Gwalther diligently. Yours, Os. Myc.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
