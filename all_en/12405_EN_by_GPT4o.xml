    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger thanks for the two letters [No. 2287 and No. 2324] and for the diligence with which Musculus answered his questions.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- In the first letter, Musculus explains that he had not written for a long time because he wanted to adhere to the counsel [of Solomon] in the dispute between Luther and the [Zürchers] stirred up by the devil, which says there is a time to speak and a time to keep silent [Ecclesiastes 3:7]. Bullinger accepts this apology.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Since Musculus now mentions this dispute, Bullinger takes the opportunity to emphasize that the [Zürchers] and the [Swiss] churches are not to blame for the renewed outbreak of this dispute. With his [“Short Confession” of 1544], Luther attacked the [Swiss] churches and both deceased and still living persons. It would have been ungodly not to respond to this. Therefore, the [Zürchers responded with their “True Confession” of 1545], and did so in a mild, benevolent, and decent manner, also in the confidence that God will bring forth good from this quarrel. However, Luther will have to justify this provocation before God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- It must be emphasized that the [Zürchers] in their writing did not bring up private matters or complaints that only concerned the churches of Zurich and Wittenberg. They dealt with the topic of the Lord's Supper (specifically its purpose, meaning, and effect) and the question of whether Luther is right with his doctrine of the Lord's Supper (which, except for the doctrine of transubstantiation, completely corresponds to the doctrine of the [Roman] Antichrist) in the interest of all churches.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- The [Lutherans] teach that the bread in its quintessence is the body of Christ itself, which both the worthy and the unworthy eat! This feeding would therefore not only be spiritual and sacramental but also physical! Furthermore, Luther teaches that this feeding conveys the forgiveness of sins and eternal life. For Luther, it is not true that the body of the risen Christ is at a limited place in heaven; rather, it should have the property of being present everywhere on earth in the honorable and worshipful sacrament (to use Luther's words). However, the Zürchers completely reject these statements. This confrontation is therefore a public matter concerning the whole church.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Since Luther rejects the Zurich view, which, however, was approximately in line with the official doctrine of the church until the 11th century, this is a serious matter that no [believer] can be indifferent to. There is no middle position possible here, just as there could not have been one in the past between the orthodox on one side and the former Arians, Eutychians, and enthusiasts on the other, and there can still be none today with the Anabaptists and Schwenckfeldians. It is not possible to remain neutral in this matter!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Bullinger does not want to force Musculus into a dispute. However, he should consider whether one may refuse help to people who confess the truth. He seems not to have understood correctly [in No. 2287] why Bullinger had accused him [in a lost letter] of not expressing himself consistently in his writings. In an [earlier] letter [from October 10, 1544], Bullinger had already explained to him what he found fault with in his writings. [The Protestants] rejected the scholastic doctrine that the sacraments conveyed grace. Now this is being reintroduced by claiming that the sacraments offer (exhibere) what they signify (significare), and that consequently, the Lord's Supper is not only a representing but also an offering sign. What is this other than claiming that grace is conveyed through the feeding in the Lord's Supper? If that were the case, one must ask who effects this. God? The [words of institution]? Or even the officiant? The believers, who must examine their faith before participating in the Lord's Supper, have already become partakers of Christ! The words spoken in the Lord's Supper only bring this back to memory. To attribute any transformative, mediating, or defensive power to these words would be as much as to grant them a magical effect! The officiant can only administer the sacraments, and the latter can convey nothing, especially since they have no power over the body of Christ. If someone replies that it is not the sign (signum) but the Lord of the sign who has the power to convey what is indicated, then this mediation is not bound to the celebration of the Lord's Supper, especially since it has already taken place through faith, through which we have been made partakers of Christ.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Therefore, it is much wiser if we only acknowledge the signs' ability to testify, represent, remind, and guarantee what the preaching of the Gospel testifies. That Musculus, therefore, rejects [in his commentary on Matthew] the old equation of the words “This is my body” with “This means my body” is unheard of for Bullinger! Such a thing was first done by Peter Lombard (in his Sentences) and previously by those who already opposed the criticism [of the doctrine of transubstantiation] expressed by Berengar of Tours.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Bullinger knows that the [Wittenberg] agreement entered into with Luther [of 1536] is highly esteemed. However, he does not know which agreement Luther would have adhered to! He also does not believe that all Germans believe with Luther that the true, complete body of Christ was eaten no less by the traitor Judas than by Peter. And if the Germans did believe this, they would be of the same opinion as the antichristian pope and would have no reason to continue railing against the sophists. But if the agreement consists in recognizing that, on the one hand, the crucified Christ is the life-giving food received through faith (so that Christ lives in us and we in him [John 6:56]), and that, on the other hand, this is represented and testified in the Lord's Supper (in which the believers participate together and united in spirit), then Luther does not adhere to this agreement!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- Bullinger would not have entrusted this to Musculus if he did not love and appreciate him so much.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">- That Musculus and his colleagues are ready to build the church [of Augsburg] together with [Johannes] Haller pleases Bullinger very much. May God make this cooperation successful.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">- Haller has praised the hospitality and goodwill of the [Augsburgers] very much. In Christ, he will in turn prove himself faithful and loving towards the [Augsburgers].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">- Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I have received two letters from you, brother in Christ, always esteemed and beloved, and I give the greatest thanks for your diligence, with which you have deigned to respond accurately to mine.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>To your earlier letters, I return these few things. You have not given any response to mine thus far due to that sacramental dispute stirred up by the work of Satan and to the great harm of the churches between Luther and us, and because he said for not light reasons that there is a time to speak and a time to be silent. You ask that I should not interpret it otherwise than the truth itself holds, etc.; and indeed you easily obtain this from me, nor should you persuade yourself otherwise here than that I think candidly of you.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>However, since you seriously mentioned that dispute, I will say only this at present, that neither we nor our churches are the cause of why this fight has rekindled. Luther wrote a book against us and our churches, against the living and the dead, such that we could not ignore it without the mark of impiety. Therefore, we responded with as much gentleness and mildness as we could, using that freedom which does not disgrace Christians and those having true faith and religion. Nor do we doubt that this fight has been restored by the work of Satan; but we are not ignorant that God, the best and greatest, in his ineffable goodness, will kindly turn what Satan intended for the harm of the church into some extraordinary benefit. Meanwhile, let him see what he will answer to the just judge, who, beyond necessity and utility, stirs up quarrels, offenses, and dissensions among men, partly lovers of truth, partly friends of superstition.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>I would only add this here: Nothing in this contention is private, which concerns either Luther's or our persons, or only our church or that of Wittenberg, but it is a public matter, which pertains to the universal church and the sincere confession of faith. For it is about the sincerity and integrity of the doctrine of the Lord's Supper, and about those things which are connected with this cause: For what purpose was the Lord's Supper instituted, what it is and what it is worth, whether Luther, agreeing in all things with the Antichrist (except for transubstantiation and the daily sacrifice), rightly thinks and teaches about it?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>They teach that the bread is the body of Christ essentially and in reality, so that both the worthy and the unworthy eat the true body of the Lord, and thus those who receive the bread receive the true and natural body of the Lord. Luther teaches that in the Supper there is not only a spiritual and sacramental eating, but also a certain third bodily eating. Luther teaches that this bodily eating confers the remission of sins and eternal life. Luther teaches that the ascension of the body of Christ is such that nevertheless here on earth with the bread and in the venerable and adorable (thus he speaks) sacrament, or under the bread, the true body of Christ is present; for the body of Christ can be in several places at once; it is a lie that Christ is in one place in heaven because of the mode of a true body. We contradict all these things diametrically. Is it not, therefore, a public matter concerning the true doctrine in the public church and pertaining to the salvation of all?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Luther condemns our doctrine, which, however, was judged the public and sincere doctrine of the church from the times of the apostles to about the year 1000, when the Antichrist finally began to introduce and establish the bread-god in his place. Therefore, the gravity of the matter, and because the cause pertains to all the children of God, seems to admit no neutrality or any middle ground. For either Luther teaches falsehoods and we teach the truth, or we teach falsehoods and Luther teaches the truth. Contradictory things cannot both be true. Such a dissension once existed between the orthodox and the Arians, Eutychians, and Enthusiasts. Such is today between the Anabaptists and Schwenckfeldians and us. Whoever does not adhere to them adheres to us. I think those who want to be neutral will not defend their action with any color. Whoever does not gather with us scatters.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I do not write these things to drag you unwillingly into a contest, but to suggest an occasion for thinking how right and attentive minds should be in such conflicts, lest anyone should fail the truth and those defending and confessing the truth. Among other things, in your earlier writings, you say: "You say I use different expressions; I wish you had written more clearly," etc. But in my first writings, to which I referred in yours, I indicated. We once condemned the scholastic dogma that sacraments confer grace. Now, almost recalling this very thing (this dogma), we say that sacraments exhibit what they signify. Therefore, it is said that some signs are exhibitive, others significative, and that the Lord's Supper is not only a significative but also an exhibitive sign. Therefore, the Supper exhibits what it signifies. The bread signifies the body of the Lord given for us; the wine signifies the blood shed for the remission of sins. Hence it follows that the very body of the Lord given for us is exhibited to those receiving with the bread, or in the bread, or under the bread. But what else is this than to say that the Supper conveys grace? By whose power, I ask? By the promise of God, by the power of the word? By the power or benefit of the minister? The Lord promises to believers the body given for them, etc., life, and those who come to the Supper have first examined themselves and possess Christ in faith; they perceive the visible symbol here, they do not first become partakers of Christ in the Supper. Words can only signify and by signifying instruct and remind. To attribute to them the power of converting, bringing, and repelling is to approach incantations. The minister administers the sacraments of the body and blood of Christ. But he cannot exhibit the sacrament, which he does not have. He does not have the body; how then does he exhibit what he signifies? If we say: Not the sign but the Lord of the sign exhibits the thing signified, it is clear that we have already been made partakers of Christ by faith, and therefore participate in his Supper, not first becoming partakers of Christ in the Supper. Unless, therefore, by the word 'exhibiting' we understand some kind of renewal and continuation, so to speak, of the grace and communion of all goods with Christ long since conveyed, I do not see how signs exhibit what they signify.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>It seems much safer to me if we attribute to the signs what can be attributed with much less danger, that they are testimonies of things done, representations and certain invocations, also seals of evangelical preaching, and public ceremonies, by which God seals his goodwill to us, his gifts, and gathers us into the unity of the body. About which I do not intend to dispute now. It seemed entirely new to me that I saw you reject the old interpretation of the words of Christ: 'This is my body' (that is: the bread signifies the body or is a symbol and figure of my body). For in the old church it was never condemned nor rejected. Peter Lombard in his Sentences was the first to begin to oppose it in public writing, although I am not unaware that those who contradicted Berengar provided the beginnings for that condemnation. But I do not write these things to dispute with you or provoke you into a contest, but so that you may understand why I wrote thus in my last writings, or what it is that I cannot approve in yours.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I know that much is attributed to the concord initiated with Luther. However, I do not see what kind of concord that is, which Luther never violates! I do not think that all throughout Germany are in concord with him in what he writes, says, preaches, urges, and insists, that the very body of the Lord in its essence and entire nature is eaten no less by Judas and any traitor than by St. Peter. But if they agree with him in this, they certainly agree with the Antichrist pope, and there is no reason to so much blame the sophists. But if the concord is in this, that the Lord himself offered himself to us on the cross as life-giving food, which we receive by true faith, so that he lives in us and we in him, and that this is represented, testified, and sealed in the Supper, in which we are visibly gathered into one body, who have first been made one with Christ and all the saints in spirit and consent, etc., then Luther violates the concord, who condemns those who think thus.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Unless I loved and esteemed you, I would not pour out these things into your bosom, dearest Musculus.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>That you and the other colleagues, in common work and one spirit, are thinking of building and preserving the church in Christ with Haller, has greatly delighted me. May Christ grant that you continue thus successfully.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Haller could not sufficiently praise your humanity and goodwill to us. Therefore, he promises mutual faith and charity, whom we faithfully commend to you and all pious brothers in the Lord Christ.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>Farewell, my dearest Musculus, and love me. All the brothers greet you. You will greet all the most esteemed colleagues for us.</p>
      <p>In Zurich, very hastily, February 18, 1546.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
