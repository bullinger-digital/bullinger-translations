    <p xml:id="regest1">Explains the request made to Basel to support the measures decided by the district council in Koblenz against M端nster. Capito claims to have heard something about an upcoming meeting of the Swiss in Zofingen; in another letter, he reported the arrival of a French envoy who is supposed to appease the German imperial estates and summon Philipp [Melanchthon] and Bucer [to Paris]. According to the report of a citizen of Basel, the Emperor has begun a bloody persecution in Holland. A rumor says that the French King has bought the Duchy of Guelders and part of the purchase sum has been received by the Burgundians. If Philipp [Melanchthon] and Bucer follow the invitation of the [French] King, they will probably be bribed or poisoned, as almost happened with Viret and Farel in Geneva. Myconius fears that [Karlstadt] could harm the church.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Everything is as it should be, as you mentioned in your letters. Finally, you ask me to say who is gathering an army against the M端nsterites and who has imposed such a large sum of money on our people. You are not unaware of the Bishop of M端nster. He has relatives who are princes, counts, nobles, and friendly bishops who are pursuing this matter. Then, in the name and commission of the Emperor, since our people joined the Swiss Confederation, they have never not been called to imperial diets, never not been ordered to provide soldiers, cavalry, and money for military matters. For this reason, they were also called a few months ago to Koblenz, and then that money was requested to conquer the M端nsterites, etc. You have this.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, Capito wrote twice, in the first letter with these words: "I hear you will meet in Zofingen concerning the article of the Eucharist. I wish to cover the cause with silence," etc. Indeed, I could write nothing else in reply than that I am amazed that the people of Strasbourg knew what was being done among us before we here in Basel did. For I was completely ignorant of the matter until Berchtold recently hinted at something like this.</p>
      <p>In the latter letter, he writes thus: "An envoy sent here and from here to Wittenberg, and about to visit the imperial estates, promises to appease the mind of the King of France, who will finally put an end to the burnings and executions of the pious. He promises a council to the Germans even against the will of the Emperor in the name of the King. He seeks Philipp [Melanchthon] and Bucer. Who does not see the schemes? Meanwhile, he has with him the Bishop of Faenza, the envoy of the Roman Pontiff." This is what he says.</p>
      <p>Let us add what a noble citizen reported these days, returning from the lower regions: concerning the King, that he has ceased from persecuting Christ, as far as punishments are concerned, but the Emperor has begun a most cruel persecution in Holland. He burned a little girl over the matter of the Eucharist, executed many by beheading. He decreed that the usual acclamations in the name of Jesus should not be made for the condemned. What happened? A certain man led to execution, when there was no one to name the name of Jesus, began to shout it himself, not ceasing until the end. In this, the executioner began to bleed from the nose and mouth until he expired. Terror then invaded the cities, so that they no longer wish to condemn anyone. Hence, a bailiff (as they call it) was appointed as a judge, who, without trial, strangles or kills anyone who has the name of the Gospel at will. In Swabia, there was such a one as Eychili, of whom you have heard.</p>
      <p>Besides these, there is a rumor that the Frenchman has bought the Duchy of Guelders and the Burgundians, who have been most hostile to the Guelders until now - and they against them - have received the money. You have this, to consider either the admirable divine counsel or the detestable human deceit.</p>
      <p>I repeat that the King calls Philipp and Bucer. What do you think gave rise to this, other than that they allow so much to papism? If they go, therefore, he will either corrupt or poison them. This is my judgment. You know, of course, that Peter Viret, Farel's colleague in Geneva, was poisoned. A morsel was prepared for both of them, I do not know how Farel escaped. It is said that the morsel was prepared by a prostitute pretending to repent.</p>
      <p>There is nothing else now to report, except that I fear the one you sent may someday bring harm to the church. This is for your bosom.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family and the dearest Utinger.</p>
      <p>Basel, March 30, 1535.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest lord.</p>
