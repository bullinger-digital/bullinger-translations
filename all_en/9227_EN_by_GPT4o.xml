      <p>S. Binas, most esteemed sir, I send to you letters written at different times, in the earlier of which I touched upon many things that would now need to be written, and I will conclude the later ones with a few words. Our people are anxiously working on how they might mitigate and avert the fury of the peasants. It is said that they are indeed returning, and you will learn in detail from Mr. Haller's letters what recently happened in Davos. Our people have sent both letters and messengers, promising the peasants that assemblies will be held according to their wishes, in which a just remedy will be found for their complaints. Oh, how fortunate it would have been to have done this in time and before the spirits were stirred!</p>
      <p>But the Phrygian is corrected only by blows. Our people are determined not to admit them if they approach.</p>
      <p>Tomorrow Vulcan's thunderbolts will explode, and they will experience how, if the situation compels, they might avert the wrath of the gods and the drawn bow with a certain divine intervention. Oh, what great confidence in things of no value! But who among them examines themselves, is led by repentance, implores the grace and favor of God? No one, no one, I say, is willing to sincerely embark on this true path of salvation. Amidst such madness, nevertheless, Bacchus, Venus, and what not of crimes rage. Nothing is said to anyone except to us ministers alone, whom they try to silence with their threats, lest we call a spade a spade.</p>
      <p>Oh, how often this passage from Jeremiah comes to mind: 'And neither he nor his servants nor the people of the land listened to the words of the Lord, which he spoke through Jeremiah the prophet.' This has been the truest cause of the destruction of all kingdoms, indeed, if it pleases the gods, this cause will be for our people to preserve this city. I wonder if the communities and signs want to exclude or drive away in a hostile manner, which I nevertheless recognize with them as the supreme authority. Thus Zedekiah, having disregarded the Babylonian, allied himself with the Egyptian, but with what outcome?</p>
      <p>I ask, if the situation (which the heavens forbid) were to come to the point that they would strive to drive away allies from the city by bloody force, what would you advise the sheep in that case (when they seek nothing else than to bring the treacherous and the worst into order)? I know it is safer for me if I remain silent; but I pity the good, who are easily deceived, nor does it seem right to me to bring aid to the impious against the pious and to lead the whole multitude into danger because of a few who are sought and who have long deserved something, yet say and do everything with impunity. Perhaps some wish to shield themselves with this and to fall with good men, so that they too may be considered good, etc. - Gantner declares a new war on us and threatens that his hand, with which he has attested to his errors, will no longer be useful to us. But more about Gantner another time. - The response from ZÃ¼rich is not being spread at this time. Once again, the most honorable Mr. Consul, Mr. Campell, and I express our gratitude to your excellence for your most excellent and consoling book, with which you have wonderfully blessed us...</p>
      <p>Our Lucius must be advised to act as a shepherd, not a hireling, if he ever takes on the priesthood in Davos; for they say it has been forbidden by the nobles for him to inveigh against them from the pulpit or to rebuke those who have deserved it.</p>
      <p>From our Chur, March 2, 1573.</p>
