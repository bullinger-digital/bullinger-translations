      <p>Greetings. Your letters, as well as those of Gwalther, have easily confirmed me in the matter which was already pleasing to me before. That scruple, which the furies of Marbach had instilled, was tormenting me even before I received yours, preventing me from sending my son to Strasbourg, where not many conveniences were available, but rather more suspicion, lest perhaps also the faith of that catechism be imposed on our own (who have their sons there) by cunning counsels; for he would have been forced to associate with their companions and all with certain tutors. However, now the matter falls out excellently and plainly, so that I could neither wish nor want otherwise, since Mr. Gwalther promises to receive my son and the order of your school is very pleasing. If only I could at least send a student worthy of such teachers. But, since the Lord dispenses his gifts in the best order, I gratefully acknowledge whatever he has bestowed upon my son, and I wish to help as much as I can so that they may be cultivated.</p>
      <p>It suffices for me if the true foundations of religion are instilled in him and he is imbued with some experience of things, and progresses in letters so that, when he is older, he may be able to pursue their studies more diligently at his pleasure; for I want him to be a statesman above all, who is not entirely ignorant of letters, even if he cannot compete with others in learning. You will perceive the state of affairs with us, etc., from the attached schedule.</p>
      <p>Farewell well.</p>
      <p>Given in Augsburg, September 17, in the year 67.</p>
      <p>Your most loving Georg von Stetten.</p>
      <p>To the venerable, pious, and learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his esteemed lord and friend. In Zurich.</p>
