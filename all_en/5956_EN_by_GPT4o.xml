      <p>Greetings. I was completely horrified (reverend father in Christ) when I read the actions of that old man. Where will the poor old man turn? But I do not doubt that there were just causes for such a severe reprimand. I do not have the Dialogues, I saw them only once and no more. Others ask me whether he is suspected of Arianism; I cannot even respond with a word and yet I would like to know; for without a doubt he will turn to us. However, if he favored the Arians, he should not be received at all. Not a word about the council for the time being. I believed it would be dissolved, especially since everyone affirmed it so unanimously and consistently. But soon we will hear something certain. I will take care of your letters to Count Martinengo; in them, I thought it necessary to inform you that Clavenna is not in Valtellina; it is a separate county.</p>
      <p>Cl√§ffner wine and Veltliner are not the same. And so that I come to the wine through this, know that here in the summer the old Veltliner was at a very reasonable price, because everyone expected that the new one would be plentiful and good. Now they are both at a higher price, as the new one is not at its best. And as Balingketus here, with whom I discussed these matters, was of my opinion, there has not yet come a truly good Veltliner; for what comes now is sweetened and adulterated. The foreign merchants need this; for in Germany, people like to drink something sweet, therefore they pay for it now; for everyone wants to be the first with the sweet one. And if 20 loads of sweet come, one can hardly find 1 load of genuine and natural. Therefore, I advise you to wait quietly until St. Paul's Day; I hope to provide for you well, if God lets us live, unless I come across a good one in the meantime. This one is not for you, it causes much fluid in the head and unrest in the body.</p>
      <p>Let me know what you want to be done about it; I will not fail, but I advise you to wait until St. Paul's Day.</p>
      <p>A good Veltliner can lie for a hundred years, and we drink such. A sweetened one would not last longer than until around Carnival and then it becomes like a sour broth, etc.</p>
      <p>I return the letters from Heidelberg and thank you. If the plague passes us by, it is a wonder. But let the Lord's will be done.</p>
      <p>It has also appeared in Maienfeld and cleared 2 houses, so I hear, and it has not gone further yet.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father.</p>
      <p>I will soon send all the acts of the Pellizari from beginning to end, as they are to be presented in the communities. November 29, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
