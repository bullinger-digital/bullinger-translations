      <p>S. Recently, Rudolph Gwalther, a man of remarkable piety and learning in the Lord, gifted me with his homilies written on the canonical writings of Saint John the Evangelist, a gift that greatly delighted my spirit. May the Lord repay him according to the riches of His grace. I also received from you the Pericope, an equally pleasing gift to me; continue to act almost as if reborn, as you have done so far, to revive the cause of Christ and to pursue your Gervasius with your former love. Regarding Johannes Jung, the minister of the Aarau church, you may learn what happened from my dearest Gwalther. Certainly, not a few of the ministers in the Bernese territory walk insincerely. Beware of allowing the old custom of the Zurich church regarding the holding of synods to fade away for any reason. It is indeed a matter of great necessity for the churches. We live and thrive like the cattail reeds in the pond. We meet twice a year in chapters, but everything is conducted too coldly, mutually bare... no proper refinement is applied, those who are a little (as is customary) more severe and learned are laughed at, the authority of the magistrate is lacking. The prefects here and there turn a blind eye to our faults, so that they may indulge more freely in their own excesses. In short: as the priest, so the people, and if nothing is done about it, it will one day bring great unrest. I speak these things to you as to an old friend in confidence. As a stranger in this land, I make little progress with my Lenzburgers, although I do not refuse to undertake any labors; such is the extent of luxury and neglect of truth.</p>
      <p>[Pray] to the Lord for me, that I may be able to endure to the end of my actions through patience. Farewell, incomparable friend, with your whole family. Given at Lenzburg, April 12, 1553.</p>
      <p>Your Gervasius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man Heinrich Bullinger, faithful minister of the Zurich church, master and dearest old friend. Zurich.</p>
