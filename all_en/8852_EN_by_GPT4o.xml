      <p>God with us. Dearly beloved son, regarding your letter B.</p>
      <p>I have understood about Löwen; however, I hear nothing at all, and I would not know anything new, since the shepherds are so dear to me, I would do and do much as a good friend. They are also not so warlike on their own, the rest learned, they will not devour everyone; but if they want to seek eternity, they will find it nowhere. God does not tolerate arrogance forever. In Chur, they have achieved little, they are all worthy, all they can, have had to hear many things.</p>
      <p>So our lords returned home yesterday; letters have been sent to me. In summary: the Fruli have withdrawn, where an impartial court was previously established; those appointed as judges had to swear to justice, and that they never took pensions, etc. Furthermore, each alliance left a hundred men there.</p>
      <p>Thus, the judges judged the lord of Rezüntz on Monday, the last of March, and sentenced him to be led under the gallows, beheaded, and buried. However, through petition, the sentence was mitigated, so that he should be judged at the usual place of execution and the body was given to the friends. Upon this, he was executed with the sword around the 3rd of the same day. Much could be written about this; it is too long and impossible for me; I am tired. Now it concerns the papal knights and others who have committed crimes, especially the murderers and the monks, etc. May God give them all their reward. You have given me a small barrel of red wine, for which I have done nothing good for you and Susanna. Therefore, I send you and Susanna hereby the symbol day, namely 10 pounds in good, exceptional thick pennies; please, you and Susanna accept it well. The whole batzen is my Lysenbethli's symbol day (or, as they say, zimpeltag), the half batzen of the other St. Oswald's girl. God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dated on Good Friday evening, April 4, 1572. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
