      <p>Greetings. I received the letter you kindly wrote to me on March 20th on the 26th of the same month; otherwise, if it had been delivered earlier, I would have acted on what I am now doing. I presented your letter to both consuls; they instruct your kindness to be of good cheer and ask me to thank you for your diligence and care. We quite believed that Klainer had come here to move to this city; but we believe he was discouraged by someone here. From certain words that our Pontisella spoke to Father Comander in my hearing, I gather that perhaps Klainer was frightened off; for I do not know how well-disposed Pontisella is towards us now.</p>
      <p>The commissioners ordered him to find another place for himself by the feast of St. Michael; perhaps because of this, the man, who is otherwise irritable and bitter in speech and, as Consul Ambrosius accused him, constantly provoking, spoke a word that Klainer interpreted in a worse sense.</p>
      <p>Whatever the case, the consuls ask again that you immediately send the one who is in Stäfa to us, if your prudence considers him suitable for this position and he himself wishes to move here. Otherwise, let him not come, as Klainer did; but if he wishes to come, let him come without delay; for the matter can no longer endure delay. If the one from Stäfa does not come and there is someone else suitable there who wishes to live with us, let him come immediately now. I wrote before, as you know, in German letters about what kind of person we require and what his salary would be. Therefore, once more, take on this burden for us.</p>
      <p>We hear nothing of war from Italy, nor yet anything about your unruly men from there. It is strange how everything is silent in such great matters. Farewell in the Lord Jesus, truly great man, and do not cease to pursue your Philippus with the benevolence you have begun. Both consuls, Tscharner and Ambrosius, as well as Father Comander, send their greetings to your kindness.</p>
      <p>From Chur, March 30, 1556.</p>
      <p>Yours in all things, Philippus Gallicius.</p>
      <p>I sent what you sent to Travers.</p>
      <p>To the truly great man, Heinrich Bullinger, his most esteemed lord, sounding the trumpet of Zurich throughout the world.</p>
