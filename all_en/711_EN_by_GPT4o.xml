      <p>Greetings. Your letter was finally delivered to me three days ago.</p>
      <p>And it happened rather inopportunely, as these two friends of mine were preparing to depart to you. I can now confidently assure you of the letter added by you for each of them, except that I suspect Farel will be displeased by the delay in publication: he had convinced himself that nothing would be better than to publish it immediately. As far as I am concerned, I am not unwilling to acquiesce to the opinion of you two. I am very grateful to you for taking care to insert those two chapters. For from there much light will be added to the whole writing and some grace. I will take care at the first opportunity to add your response about publishing the confession of faith to my book.</p>
      <p>Moreover, of the two friends I mentioned, one is Robert Estienne, who does not need a recommendation with you. The other is also a very pious man, who is bringing the children of a good man there, so that they may learn piety with you along with letters and the German language.</p>
      <p>Since the father is worthy of the friendship of all good men, I ask you again and again to choose an honest and chaste home, where they can be raised comfortably and in the fear of the Lord. The expense of the duty will be paid as you deem fair.</p>
      <p>All my colleagues send you their diligent greetings. In my name, you will convey many greetings to all yours, along with Mr. Lelio and the other friends.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most distinguished man and brother in the Lord, much to be honored. May the Lord preserve you and your household and be with you in all things. October 17, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed pastor, brother, and fellow minister of the church in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
