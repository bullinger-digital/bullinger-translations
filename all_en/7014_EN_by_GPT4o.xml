      <p>Greetings. Today, for the first time, I received your letter written the day before yesterday by Caroli, honorable lord and godfather, and I am glad that you have received mine in the meantime and that you are satisfied. It also troubled me that I could not have any news for such a long time; otherwise, I would have written sooner and more frequently. I am returning the letters from St. Gallen, which I received along with these; for they contain nothing that is not in others or that we did not have before, except for a few things that I have copied. There is one thing in them that I do not understand, which is written: "So glad are we that on Wednesday the reconciliation between the abbot took place." I do not know what kind of reconciliation that is, and how the city finally reconciled with the abbot. If it is not troublesome, please explain this to me. With us, there is nothing else than what you already have.</p>
      <p>My lord, the bailiff of Moudon, has recently been in Milan; he writes about a great armament that is in Italy, also about the arrival of the Spaniards. The rumors are different: some speak of the Netherlands, others of Geneva.</p>
      <p>Therefore, one must indeed pray to God and be concerned. My lords, the envoys, have not yet returned from Geneva; I do not know what they will bring. I think it will at least be an extension until further notice. Next Monday, the 10th of this month, there will be another meeting in Fribourg; there, Fribourg and Valais are supposed to clarify things. One hopes for good from them; yet I cannot know what their decision will be.</p>
      <p>I have nothing from France at the moment; I hope Beza will write me something through my lords, the envoys. The steward of KÃ¶nigsfelden has sent me what your young lord Hartmann and he have written to each other. I will send you the print of the imperial mandate and the letters of renunciation again later; I have not been able to show it to anyone yet except the lord of Diesbach; he is currently the deputy in the absence of Steiger and the others and sends you his warm greetings. These things I write hastily to you.</p>
      <p>The brothers and all the fellow ministers greet you, as well as my father-in-law, mother, wife, and Zehender.</p>
      <p>Bern, February 4, 1566.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
