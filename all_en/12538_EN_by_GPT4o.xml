    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius is delighted with Bullinger's letters because they convey useful information. He is very pleased that the Swiss Confederates are so willing to march against Emperor [Charles V.]. The Diet [in Baden] will probably be encouraged to make decisions that are beneficial both to the fatherland and to the word of God.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Bullinger's letter [not received] prompted Myconius to encourage his [parish] to lead a better life and to adopt a determined attitude against the cunning and godless enemy.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Myconius has received the news about the standard-bearer [Hans Wilpert] Zoller and about the unity between the princes and [imperial] cities assembled in Ulm with interest. However, he did not understand the term "gottspuͤssiges Spangerli," which probably refers to Charles V. It is also unclear why Bullinger believes that the news spread by [King] Ferdinand about the approach of [Sultan Suleiman I.] is untrue. However, he now understands what Bullinger wrote about the Rhenish nobility. The people of Chur will probably need support [from the Swiss Confederates]. The situation will certainly improve if they stand in the way of the Italian troops. The traitor [Charles V.] has beautifully defended the fratricide [Alfonso Diaz]! What a good memory in the service of evil!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Myconius has so far heard that the Bohemians do not want to provide help against the Germans. However, he now hears something different from Strasbourg. But why should the Hungarians and the Austrians offer their help to the Emperor when they already have enough to deal with themselves? A pious man [Martin Bucer] hopes that God will unite the forces [of the Swiss Confederates] with those of the Swabians and the Rhine residents, especially since everything between France, Franconia, and Bavaria is essentially one people, and indeed a numerous people. However, one should act quickly. [Johann Friedrich of] Saxony and Landgrave [Philipp of Hesse] are preparing and want to ensure that the [opposing] troops do not connect with each other. The Landgrave is said to be pressured by the southern Netherlands, but he can count on the forces of the pious [King Christian III of] Denmark in this regard. Also, [Duke Albrecht of] Prussia will probably fulfill his duties.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Myconius has read Charles V's letter to the Swiss Confederation. What cunning and impudence! Apparently, he considers the Swiss Confederates to be foolish! Hopefully, they will realize, like the wolf in Aesop's fable, that all tracks lead into [the lion's den], but none lead out again.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Evidence of the Emperor's wickedness is a coin minted in Italy, which depicts the Emperor's head on one side and a woman (holding a crucifix in her right hand and a chalice in her left) with the inscription: "Defender of the Catholic Religion." This corresponds to Bullinger's report on the arguments used in Italy to recruit mercenaries against the Germans. However, the Emperor might face a fate similar to that of [Duke Heinrich of] Brunswick. The latter also considered himself a loyal servant of the papacy, a leader of the Emperor, the Nuremberg League, and the old religion.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- Duke Moritz [of Saxony] is said to have abandoned his zeal due to the Emperor's flattery. Nothing is heard from the Elector Palatine [Friedrich]. Duke [Ulrich of] Württemberg, on the other hand, proves to be steadfast and intends to attack the Emperor on July 15. May he bring "Fercilandus" [King Ferdinand] and his brother [Charles V.] to ruin in Germany, just as he was once deprived of his land by the former!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- It is not known what the people of Nuremberg are doing. They are said to provide a hundred smaller bombards ("tonulae"), which were intended against the Turks, for the current war.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Myconius sends greetings to Bullinger's family, [Rudolf] Gwalther, and [Konrad] Pellikan.</p>

      <p>I rejoice whenever I see your handwriting. It always contains something that is both pleasant and beneficial to know. Your latest letter delighted me greatly because it contains information about the Swiss Confederates' most wicked march against the Emperor's arms. There is hope that decisions will be made at the Diet that are more advantageous due to this opportunity. May the Lord grant that they are both for the fatherland and for the word of the Lord.</p>

      <p>From your letters, I have today encouraged my own people to follow your example, urging them to amend their lives and morals and to engage in diligent prayer. I will see what I have accomplished. We must indeed pray that the Lord kindles our hearts and minds to zeal for His name, provides us with wise counsel, and grants us strength and courage to act boldly against the most cunning and godless enemy, if it can be brought to this point, so that he himself may learn to think rightly about the Lord.</p>

      <p>I was pleased to hear about the standard-bearer Zoller. And I was even more pleased to hear about the harmonious spirits of the princes and cities who were in Ulm. I hope that this harmony is in the Lord. If so, without a doubt, the Lord is present, as He is the God of peace. You mention a title, I think, for Charles, "gottspuͤssiges Spangerli"; I do not understand it. However, I am surprised that you think Ferdinand's announcement about the Turkish advance is falsely fabricated. Why would he fabricate it, unless perhaps he is trying to redirect his forces elsewhere, after realizing that our forces are advancing so boldly? For I cannot imagine that he is attempting to frighten our forces in this way. I now understand about the Rhenish nobility. The people of Chur would need support; for with the Italian army hindered, everything will be better through the Lord. The traitor of Regensburg rightly defends the fratricide; but see what a memory in the service of evil!</p>

      <p>I had heard that the Bohemians would bring no aid against the Germans. Now I receive different news from Strasbourg. I do not know which is true. And I am surprised that the Hungarians and Austrians are said to be offering help to Charles, when they themselves have enough to deal with at home. A certain distinguished man writes in these words: "We must pray to the Lord to unite our people with the pious Swabians and Rhenish; thus, with minimal effort, it would be accomplished that there is one people, whatever is between France and Eastern Franconia and Bavaria." Something could then be accomplished against such a multitude through the Lord. But there is a need for speed, etc. The Saxon and the Landgrave are preparing very strongly (for so they write), and they are doing their utmost to prevent the armies of the impious from coming together. Meanwhile, the Landgrave is pressed by a great force of the Belgians.</p>

      <p>But the Dane will throw himself entirely into this - a king of extraordinary piety, virtue, and success in battles. The piety and virtue of the Prussians is exceptional; there is no doubt that they will do their duty.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>I have read Charles of Spain's letters to the Swiss. Good God, how cunning, deceitful, and impious they are! I could prove all this myself. He thinks the simple (not to say foolish) Swiss will not understand his deceit, while he promises them golden mountains. Indeed, I hope the Lord will grant that they will understand the deceitful Spaniard with simple prudence, so that they may say with Aesop's fox: "All the tracks terrify me, all facing towards you, none going back." He lies against the princes who have so far supported the gospel, attributing nothing to them but tyranny and the occupation of the entire empire, if no one were to hinder them. A sign of impiety is a coin that is circulated here from Italy. On one side it bears the head of Charles and this inscription: "Charles V. Augustus, Emperor, Caesar." On the other side, the image of a woman, which is religion, holding a crucifix in her right hand, a chalice with a host in her left, at her feet the books of Moses; the marginal inscription is: "Defender of the Catholic Religion." This agrees with the letters where you write about the tricks he uses in Italy to raise soldiers against the Germans. It is surprising if he does not meet the same fate as the Brunswickian, who likewise boasted of being a commissioner and faithful minister of papal sanctity, also the supreme leader of the imperial majesty and the Nuremberg League and the old religion.</p>

      <p>Duke Maurice is said to be so captivated by Charles's flattery that he is completely cooling off. And I hear not a word about the Palatine, even when I ask. About Duke Württemberg, all is good, holy, and strong. May the Lord add strength, so that, just as he was once deprived of his homeland by Ferdinand, he may now strip both him and his brother of Germany. It is also said that he has informed Charles that he will engage with him on the 15th of this month, wherever he may find him.</p>

      <p>I do not know whether the people of Nuremberg are doing anything. There was a rumor that they have a hundred small bombards (as some call them) collected for the Turkish war and now to be used for the present war. I wish to be informed about this.</p>

      <p>Farewell in Christ with your household, Gwalther, and Pellican, and all the pious brothers. Let us pray together with your churches to the Lord, that He may have mercy on us in this most severe trial. In Basel, hastily, July 8, 1546.</p>
      <p>Yours, Os. Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned man and most esteemed brother in Christ.</p>
