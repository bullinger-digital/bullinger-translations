      <p>S. P. D. I did not respond to your very welcome letters and some notes for the sole reason that I had no trustworthy messenger at hand to whom I could entrust them. Now, with the opportunity presented by the very dear Mr. Johannes, the pastor at Rheineck in the Rhine Valley, I had nothing more important than to write back. First of all, I did not want to hide from you that I took great care to deliver the copy of my letters to Antron, which your esteemed council sent to me in good faith to be returned to our Bertzius, and I asked the man, since he already had a clear view of your city's exceptional goodwill, to consider how he might also gain and secure the favor of the other three cantons through the fairness of his cause. I believe he will act cautiously, as he is a good and pious man, certainly full of faith, and will not give room to the deceit and schemes of the dark and bitter-minded hypocrite. But perhaps Bertzius has written to you about these matters; he certainly consulted Mr. Holtzhab, whose faith and goodwill alone can largely protect his affairs; this is what I sincerely wish and pray to the Lord Cham, so that the monster of obstacles may not arise for us.</p>
      <p>Regarding the ministers of Lausanne that you sent, I have read and cannot sufficiently marvel at their madness. I would not believe that Bucer, with all due respect to you, would instill such ignorance in any ministers. This is almost the sophistic subtlety of the French people (to use a term from Tertullian in passing), which has nothing solid and does not even recognize Scripture, which attributes the planting and watering, that is, the external work and the very task entrusted and handed over by the Lord for life and salvation, to the ministers, while the increase comes from God alone as a gift of the spirit of faith, 1 Corinthians 3. However, I acknowledge (if they might object) that the gift of faith is also entrusted to the ministry, and where the word of faith runs, striking the external ears, there the gift of faith may awaken the internal ears of the heart, but not in all, nor by the will of the minister, but by the foreknowledge of the Lord and only to those who are ordained to eternal life. Hence, the word of Jesus Christ to Paul in Acts 26, where Paul is sent to open the eyes of the unbelievers so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God. Furthermore, those words of Christ in Acts 18, where he commands the apostle to remain in Corinth because he has many people in that city, do not mean that ministers should be believed to have the gift of the internal word while teaching the external, but they prove that the Lord is with the ministers and grants the light of faith to those whom he wills and who are known only to him; for it is his alone to open hearts, even while the external word runs, just as the Lord opened the heart of Lydia, the seller of purple, in Philippi, Acts 17. Otherwise, the apostle would not have shaken the dust off his feet against the Jews in his first arrival in Corinth, nor would he have prayed for them with curses but with salutations, who rejected the doctrine of the external ministry; for he would have conferred the grace of faith upon them and turned them from darkness to the living God through Jesus the Son. But this was not Paul's task, but Christ's, who was with Paul.</p>
      <p>For the apostle would not have grieved with such consternation of mind for the unbelieving Jews, who were his brothers according to the flesh, for whom he wished to become anathema, that he might be lost so that they might be saved, if it had been in the apostle's power and province to confer the spirit of the Lord and to animate them to repentance of error.</p>
      <p>He would have immediately freed himself from pain and would have greatly rejoiced in the eternal fruit of salvation conferred upon his brothers. Indeed, he would not have been forced to say to Agrippa in Acts 26: I would wish from God, not only in a small part, but also greatly, not only you but all who hear me today to be such as I am, except for my chains, etc. What are you doing, Paul? Why do you wish for Agrippa and others what you could provide through your ministry, if you only wished? Why do you not immediately free yourself from this trouble and others from the burden of unbelief? What will the brothers of Lausanne say here, I pray? These are good and firm and sound and indeed well-established testimonies of the spirit of the Lord, which I truly wonder they neglect. It is much more painful that they do not accept Christ, who so clearly explains and openly admonishes in Matthew 10, that if anyone does not receive their word, they should leave them and shake off the dust from their feet, that is, condemn their obstinacy, which is liable to Gehenna, unless the Lord sees otherwise, who gives when he wills and gives to whom he wills. For certainly, it is not given to all to know the mysteries of the kingdom of heaven. I direct these to you, my teacher, who demanded my judgment on this matter. Now let us discuss secular matters.</p>
      <p>Mr. Lienhart Bek has written a letter to Mr. Antoni Zilin, our church servant, from which something can be learned; I send it to your honor. It is thought that he wants to separate the strong between the Pope and France and to place himself with strength between them. It will be a concern that he will also try to keep the Confederates behind him with some schemes; this will be learned from those of Constance. If he holds them firmly, our matter will be more seriously considered; if he holds them roughly, we can expect more praiseworthy peace from the Confederation. You will learn that France is not only troubled at one end, as he intends to set his companion from Savoy, and it is to be feared that the sum of the plan will be to give everyone something to do so that no one can provide strong help to his opponent. And if he succeeds there, he will ultimately play the game with each party, as the cat has the habit with the mouse, etc.</p>
      <p>It is certain that the King of Poland and the Grand Master or Duke of Prussia are in great and organized armament; for our people have certain reports of this. Likewise, those in the sea cities are similarly organized, and Magdeburg is still unshaken, and, as the saying goes, the new Elector Maurice wants to besiege it, which matter will extend the captivity of the Elector of Saxony. May God have mercy on him.</p>
      <p>Bucer is said to be in Augsburg with the Elector of Brandenburg and preaching publicly with much attendance; opposite him, the papal bishop of Mainz is preaching. And there is concern that the imperial cities will not soon be freed from this burdensome yoke of temporal administration unless God sends an unexpected matter from heaven.</p>
      <p>Fortm√ºller has spoken much with me about the French alliance and believes that if the Christian cities do not enter into such an alliance, it would be because Gallus intends to pursue his intended persecution of our faith and to stand against peaceful people, etc., and if such were included in the alliance, it might bring great comfort to the faithful in France and not a small advancement to our religion in general. Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, the day after the Kalends of May, in the year 1548. Vadianus.</p>
      <p>If there is anything rare or new from the upcoming assemblies that can be entrusted and committed in good faith to the greatest friends, let me know. You know to whom you can most greatly gratify in this matter.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and beloved man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, president of the most ample church of Zurich, dear friend and like a brother.</p>
