    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] What Keller shares here with tears, Bullinger should keep to himself. As he knows, Johannes Haller and Thoman Ruman were called back home by the Zurich council for compelling reasons. However, the Augsburg council is trying to disguise its defection from the Christian [Schmalkaldic] League by continuing to preach the Gospel and thus deceiving the common people. Therefore, it is trying to retain the unfortunate preachers in their office until it has satisfied the Emperor by allowing the godless scum and filth [the priests and the mass] to return to the city.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Keller and his colleagues have long seen this coming, as they have seen through the mindset of these "chief tax collectors" [merchants] for years. Haller and Ruman have also understood this and therefore asked for their dismissal.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] But now the Augsburg council wants to write to the Zurich council. Keller wants to warn Bullinger of this ruse so that the Zurich council does not reverse the recall of Haller and Ruman. For soon other Augsburg preachers will also have to ask for dismissal. The political and ecclesiastical situation is so dire that no reasonable person can hope for anything better (Keller has recently hinted at this [with HBBW XIX, No. 2865]). Georg Frölich also often acknowledged this in the presence of Haller and Keller. Moreover, he has no doubt that the council will allow the priests to return to the city with their business around the mass.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] This is what awaits the poor Augsburg pastors! Bullinger is warned. May the Lord preserve him for his church for a long time!</p>

      <p>Greetings. Most excellent and distinguished Bullinger, what I am sharing with you now, not without tears, I ask you to keep hidden in your heart. You know that Johannes Haller and Thoman Ruman were recalled home by the Zurich council, having undoubtedly compelling reasons for this recall. However, our council, trying to disguise its detestable defection from the holy and Christian league with the preaching of the Gospel and to deceive the simple common people under this pretext, is attempting to retain us, the miserable ministers of the word, in office until it has satisfied the Emperor with its unjust and impious promises, that is, until the dregs of impiety and the cesspool of all evils have been brought into our city!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>This is not only perceived by us, who have understood the minds of these "chief tax collectors" (merchants) for many years, but also by Haller and Ruman, who have both humbly requested their dismissal.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>But now our council has decided to write to your council before they are dismissed. However, since I know that everything is done with tricks, deceit, and cunning, I could not refrain from informing you, my beloved and esteemed brother, of this, so that you would not allow yourself to be persuaded or, if you prefer, deceived by the writings of anyone. For what Haller is doing today, some of us will do the day after tomorrow. Indeed, the situation, both secular and Christian, is so dire here today that no one but a fool can promise themselves anything better (than what I have just outlined to you). This is something that our Georg Frölich has admitted to Haller and me openly, once and again, and moreover, there is no doubt that the priests, with their business around the mass, will enter our city at the request of the Emperor, with the consent of our council.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Behold what hope remains for us, the thrice miserable! You have what I wanted to warn you about with a friendly spirit. May the Lord preserve you for His church for a long time. Amen! From Augsburg, May 25, 1547. Yours in the Lord, forever devoted, Michael Keller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, primary bishop of the Zurich church and my esteemed brother.</p>
