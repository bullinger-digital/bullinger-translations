      <p>Most illustrious man.</p>
      <p>The most illustrious Duke of Prussia, my most gracious lord (for I follow the usual manner of speaking), has recommended to me a man of better note, who will deliver this letter; for whom, as I have done here as much as I could, I will also do as much as I can with you. I commend him to you as much as I possibly can, so that you may receive him with your customary kindness and send him back to us unharmed, so that I can immediately send him back to the most illustrious Prince of Prussia, and I do not doubt that his highness will be grateful to you for this. "Grant peace, O Lord, in our days," which I pray for. Weigel will speak in person about my entire situation; I will add nothing more. Farewell and greetings to the entire church, school, and family, you know this has been my custom. May the Heavenly Father increase His divine treasures, spirit, and faith in all through Christ our Lord.</p>
      <p>TÃ¼bingen, February 20, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, honorable brother. Zurich.</p>
