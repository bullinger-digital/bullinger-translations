    <p xml:id="regest1">In view of Bullinger's modest gifts, Blarer's thanks are exaggerated. Rather, Bullinger has to thank, especially since he overwhelms Blarer with letters and writings for forwarding. - He is waiting for Blarer's judgment on the [“True Confession”]. Blarer rightly criticizes that the writing is too long, but [the people of Zurich] lacked the time to shorten it. If there is to be another writing, it will be shorter. Be that as it may, [the people of Zurich] were forced to write this. - Bullinger would also forward news concerning Blarer. - Someone (allegedly Calvin) has reprinted the papal [letter of reproach] to Charles V under the title “Paternal Admonition of Paul III, Roman Pontiff, to the Most Invincible Emperor Charles V, with Annotations” and has provided it with highly apt annotations. Blarer will probably have already seen a copy of it, otherwise Bullinger would have sent his. - The Basel council has suspended Johannes Gast because he wrote to Geneva eight years ago that Karlstadt was an obstacle and that bad conditions were spreading in Basel. This letter was handed over to the council by someone. Gast does not know where to move. - Bullinger recommends [Jakob] Metzler, who makes a good impression, to Blarer, [Bartholomäus Metzler], and [Jakob himself]. [Jakob] will probably find a place with Otto [Werdmüller], otherwise with [Konrad] Pellikan. He will be taken care of. - The girl [Anneli...] behaved well with Heinrich Haldenstein, only she no longer wants to serve him, as she apparently prefers to wander around in poverty as before. - Bullinger encloses a letter for forwarding to [John] Butler, whom he sends his regards.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>You are too generous in giving thanks, brother in the Lord, venerable one. It is a small thing, whatever I have done for your brother and you. I would wish, if it were possible, to show my spirit towards you and yours in greater ways. I owe you much more, to whom I am almost always a burden; for how many letters and booklets, I ask, have I now overwhelmed you with? You have been forced to inquire about each and every one of these almost like a messenger. Therefore, I rightly give you the greatest thanks for your kindness and for your patience.</p>
      <p>However, I have not yet heard your judgment on our response, which I am still expecting. You rightly judge that the book is quite lengthy. We will be shorter if there is to be a second writing. And I wish the first response were shorter, but there is no time to abbreviate it. However things may turn out, we did what we did out of necessity, and we did it for the glory of God's name and the benefit of the church.</p>
      <p>Nor will I allow you to be ignorant of anything that I think you should know. Someone (they say it is Calvin) has responded learnedly, prudently, severely, and with authority to the writing of Paul III to Charles V, in which he dissuades him from making any agreement or transaction with the Protestants for the sake of religion. Unless I thought you had seen it before me, I would have sent a copy, of which I have only one. He first took care to print the Admonition of the Pope, then added annotations to it.</p>
      <p>The Basel council has deprived the excellent, most learned, and faithful man, Johannes Gast, of his ministry for no other reason than that he wrote to Geneva eight years ago that Karlstadt was causing many delays and that crimes were exulting in Basel. Letters have now been given to the council, I do not know by whom; this has been reported to him, which he greatly regrets. He is in doubt about where to go.</p>
      <p>May he be provided for again!</p>
      <p>Metzler is and will be highly recommended to me both because of you and because of his father and himself. He seems to be an excellent young man. He will be received, I think, by Otto, or if he is reluctant to receive him, I will see what Pellicanus will do and is going to do. Do not doubt, he will be provided for; we will consider him as ours and as one of our own.</p>
      <p>The girl has behaved well with Heinrich Haldenstein, except that she, out of poverty, has left, and at last with them (I do not know for what reasons) did not want to stay. She seems to prefer to wander in poverty again rather than serve, etc. Otherwise, they say nothing dishonorable about her (the girl).</p>
      <p>You will pray for us to Christ, in whom you will be well with all yours. You will give this letter to Mr. Butler, whom you will greet courteously in my name and in the name of mine. Zurich, March 27, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours, H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, brother and sincere friend, always to be honored. Constance.</p>
