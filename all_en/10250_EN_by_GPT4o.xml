    <p xml:id="regest1">In the name of his colleagues, Bullinger thanks Bucer for his visit and his cooperation in the church unification. Bucer's letter to Jud from June 23, 1532, had raised concerns among the brethren, which Bucer was now able to dispel with his speech. That Luther - as Bucer says - is of the same opinion as the people of Zurich, they cannot see in light of his epistle to the people of Frankfurt. However, they want to strive for peace and not publicly slander Luther. Bucer should take this response in good faith and, moreover, refrain from recommending a creed that is less suitable for the Church of Zurich.</p>

      <p>Thank you, most learned Bucer, dearest brother, on behalf of all the brothers, for visiting us, instructing us, and laboring with such diligence for the concord of the church, driven by brotherly love.</p>
      <p>We also honor the spirit of Christ dwelling in you, and we rejoice that you share our sentiments, which you have clearly enough expressed. Therefore, we regard you as a brother and a teacher to be respected in the Lord.</p>
      <p>As for that letter written to Leo last year in July, we have not and will not misrepresent you, but your letter, seen by the brothers, raised some suspicion, which you have now dispelled with your clear speech.</p>
      <p>However, regarding Luther, as you say, agreeing with us, we indeed allow it. Yet, we have not been able to see this so far, especially since in the booklet recently published to the people of Frankfurt, he handled the matter of the Eucharist in such a way that it would have been better to remain silent.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, we will have peace with him, as far as it concerns us and as much as the peace of our church will allow. We will not slander the man with insults, nor have we been accustomed to doing so publicly; however, we cannot say that he agrees with us, since he accuses all those of treason who claim that there is concord between us and him.</p>
      <p>Now, regarding the manner of speaking, we allow him his own, and we maintain ours, consistent with Scripture and the Fathers. For it says: "Do this in remembrance of me" [1 Cor 11:24], and they: "This signifies or represents my body."</p>
      <p>These are the few things we respond with, Bucer, and we pray that you consider them in good faith, and also, that you do not continue to urge a creed that is perhaps more obscure and not entirely suitable for our church.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, Leo Jud, Heinrich Engelhart, Dr. Andreas Karlstadt, Erasmus Fabricius, Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, etc., ministers of the word of the Zurich church, responded to M. Bucer, minister of the Strasbourg church, on May 8, 1533.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and erudite Dr. Oswald Myconius, chief minister of the word of the Lord among the people of Basel, brother and dearest colleague.</p>
