      <p>Greetings. Through the most distinguished man, Mr. Friedrich von Salis, (who never seems to have praised your utmost humanity, goodness, praise, and dedication enough) I received your most gracious letters, which were indeed so pleasing and acceptable to me that nothing could have been offered to me more gratifying, since they came from such a great man and my most loving friend (which is your goodness). And indeed, you have consoled my poverty in a holy manner and have shown me cheerfulness in my distress.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in my poverty, I will remain more joyful than ever before and, with David, I will say: "Better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere," and: "I have chosen to be a doorkeeper in the house of my God rather than dwell in the tents of the wicked." It pleased me immensely that you have taken Johann Travers von Salis under your care. For under such a man, what good is not to be hoped for him? As for the fact that you remember me and all that I have written to you in the past, and that you love me and promise your assistance to me, I give you immense thanks and will continually pray to the Lord for you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my always most esteemed Bullinger, to whom I always commend myself greatly.</p>
      <p>Samaden, 14th of February, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours in the Lord, Pietro Parisotti (Bergomas).</p>
      <p>[To the most learned] man Mr. Heinrich [Bullin]ger, his most esteemed [Lord]. ZÃ¼rich.</p>
