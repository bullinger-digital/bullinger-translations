      <p>Greetings, dearest brother. Lest my name be unknown to your kindness and cause some wonder, I will first say who I am, and then I will pursue what I wish. I am a young man named Thaddaeus, an Italian by nationality, a native of Locarno, a most faithful servant of our illustrious lords, the Swiss. I spent three years in Basel, where I devoted myself to the liberal arts and medicine, then I went to Pavia and spent two years there in medical studies; now, to put it briefly, I am at home, in Locarno, because there are holidays. I am a most loving supporter of you and all Christians, especially those who deserve well of the Christian republic, and I am so devoted to sacred studies (far be it from me to boast) that I spend the greatest part of my time on them.</p>
      <p>So much for that; for the paper is to be dedicated to other matters of greater importance. Unless I knew that it was known to you all that there are not a few Christians among us who have often been disturbed by not light persecutions, this would have to be mentioned first; but it is not unknown to me that my most esteemed teacher, the supreme defender of this cause, which you will hear, Mr. Johannes Beccaria, who has come there for this reason, has often written to the dearest man, Mr. Konrad Pellikan, and has more fully narrated to him the persecutions we endure. Therefore, I will proceed to the matter itself. Ten days ago, at the instigation of certain Pharisees, a most wicked precursor of the Antichrist came to us (the Lord and the best of the Locarnese will be my witness that I do not lie), unlearned, obstinate, malicious, who has nothing of faith, very little of piety, as little as possible of charity, not even a little of evangelical doctrine, no trace of humanity. This brazen-faced false prophet dared to ascend the pulpit and preach and teach all human traditions and all kinds of superstitions (as you will gather from his conclusions, which we send). Consider for yourself, with what spirit so many Christians, who are among us, could endure such a scoundrel. But hear this patiently above all. As soon as he arrived here, we had an edict from our governor that no one should molest this false preacher with words or deeds; for some of our Pharisees had negotiated this matter with the governor. Hence, before we heard him, we judged him a false teacher and an enemy of Christ. The next day we heard his sermon, so ridiculous, so impious, that we resolved among ourselves not only not to hear him anymore, but to rise against such a scoundrel and reject and refute such impious doctrine. The following day, while the impious sermon was being held, many were absent. When the governor noticed this, he issued another edict that under the penalty of fifty crowns we should all hear the sermon.</p>
      <p>Then many began to complain openly about such force and injustice; for the false prophet himself, with his supporters, persuaded our governor of such things. A tumult arose among the people; for some believed the false prophet brought from the company of the wicked, others believed in Christ our Savior. Finally, many conspired against us to destroy us, and on the ninth of August, by the governor's edict, five were summoned before the tribunal, among whom I was also. We approached the summons cheerfully, always having these words in our mouths: "If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you" and: "The apostles departed rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer for Christ" and many other such things. In the council sat our magnificent governor, two interpreters, the governor's deputy, the false prophet himself, two priests, one of whom is called our pastor, but in truth he is not, two doctors from Lugano, all of whom conspired for our destruction. Our distinguished mediator also sat, then we five. Immediately the false prophet produced the impious conclusions, of which I spoke above, and wanted to force us, with the consent of the governor and other supporters, to either concede or deny them.</p>
      <p>However, they could obtain neither from us; for the spirit of the Lord was always with us and fought excellently for the truth.</p>
      <p>For we showed them that we are Christians, but they are far removed from the Christian name, let alone from being human. Yet those same false witnesses and false judges, of whom you will hear, did with us what the Jews did with Christ and the apostles. For although they grasped the truth, they were more and more provoked to anger against Christ and more and more tested us and strained every nerve to find out one thing or another. If we had openly denied, they would have handed us over to Vulcan, unless the Lord had delivered us from their hands; if we had affirmed, they would have treated us badly in the same way. After enough disputation, our governor, against our will (which was against all law and all equity), chose four judges from those who conspired against us (oh, for the faith of gods and men), two priests and two doctors from Lugano, and added a fifth, our doctor. You see, most illustrious man and dearest brother, how they treated us.</p>
      <p>These four most wicked judges judged those conclusions to be Catholic (as they say), that is, to be evangelical and to be believed, and us to be heretics unless we approved them. We again fought vigorously against the wicked judges; but finally, after dismissing the four, they only threw my teacher into prison, whom the Lord, however, brought out of prison the same day. Now fearing that they, especially the governor, who says he does all these things by the precepts of our most illustrious lords, may rage worse against us, we beseech you, sweetest brother, and we pray and beseech your whole church, that you may be willing to help us in this matter until our day comes, which we will not escape at all. Therefore, unless it is troublesome to undertake a little labor for Christ, you will tell this cause to your most wise senate with other Christians and defend it with all your might, so that we may safely act at home and proclaim the doctrine of Christ. But if you see that you are attempting these things in vain and foresee some danger that may threaten us, please, I beg you, inform us; for we will prepare an escape elsewhere according to that: "If they persecute you in one city, flee to another."</p>
      <p>We hope, however, with the Lord's help, to obtain that we may act at home. Let this suffice. Again and again, I commend this most just cause to your kindness.</p>
      <p>I am, as much as I am, at your reverence's service. Locarno, 5th of the Ides of August, 1549.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful minister of the holy church of Zürich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
