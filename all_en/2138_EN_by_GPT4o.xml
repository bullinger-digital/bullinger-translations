      <p>S. P. I received your letters along with the enclosed news, for which I give you my utmost thanks; for I feel your kind disposition towards us, and I would have replied long ago; but these soldiers have kept me so occupied that I have been forced to neglect even very necessary matters. However, henceforth you will not lack the service of a friend.</p>
      <p>Behold, your second letters are delivered, in which you mention the same things about the marquis that I also sent to your lords at the same time, and it is pleasing that we, as friends, share everything; for from this, the truth unknown to the Emperor's men can be told. And while I was writing this, I also received a packet from Mr. Vergerius, which I know was sent by you; he writes the same things, but adds that Maurice is dead, which I do not yet believe; for today I have recent letters from Nuremberg, which make much mention of these matters. But moreover, he will soon be in Rhaetia and, if I wish anything, he asks that I send my letters to our legate, which I will do at the first opportunity; for he promises to come there within 12 days, and I am surprised that he will not visit you on the way. If it happens otherwise, please inform him that I have received your four Württemberg packets, but I have not received that booklet, which he mentions in his last letters, and I believe he has forgotten it. You expect news from me: you will have everything most truthful from the memorial enclosed here; you will read it, and afterwards give it to the magistrate and council in my name; otherwise, I would have sent my own. We deeply mourn the death of that young king, who in the future could have done much among our people due to the great kinship and friendship. These are the arts of the Emperor, whose fury and schemes spare no one.</p>
      <p>May the Lord be the judge. The king is hastening with a very powerful army towards Hesdin, and if the Emperor's men wait, a great battle will soon be fought. In Piedmont, everything is prosperous; our army has taken ten cities and several castles by surrender and is always advancing. The Emperor wanted to gather an army there, but because money is lacking, no one wants to be present or follow promises. I have returned from Freiburg and will be staying here for a month; meanwhile, make sure that I often receive your most welcome letters, and whenever possible. Farewell, most excellent one. Solothurn, this Wednesday, in haste.</p>
      <p>Yours always, Bassefontaine.</p>
      <p>The Prince of Salerno occupies the entire Mediterranean Sea with the Turkish army, so that the Emperor's son did not dare to cross, and because he feels there is no longer any hope in the English marriage, as he hoped, he begins to negotiate with the King of Portugal to marry his daughter.</p>
      <p>I would have written many days ago to Vergerius in the Duchy of Württemberg; but he always informed me that he did not want to stay there long.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
