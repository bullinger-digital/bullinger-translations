      <p>God be with us, beloved son, I thank you and Susanna for the invitation; I had dinner with our people last night. May God confirm you in your endeavors and undertakings; may He be your help, and hurry as much as you can to put your affairs in order; in doing so, you will also relieve me of a very heavy burden. What I have, I send to you here. The Count Palatine of Kraków writes to me, could not be more friendly, from Poland. You will see it sometime. Our Johannes is sick in Kraków; soon a message will come. I cannot write more at this time. God be with you all. June 30, in the year 1570.</p>

      <p>To my dear son Hans Rudolf Bullinger, pastor in Berg.</p>
