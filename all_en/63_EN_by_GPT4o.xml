    <p xml:id="regest1">As a thank you for Myconius' letter [18046 from February 29, 1548], Bullinger now sends him his writing [«Series et digestio temporum»], which he has written for a better understanding of the letters of the New Testament. May the little book be helpful to many and bring honor to Christ!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Otherwise, Bullinger has nothing to report. He has conveyed [Konrad] Wedenschwiler [the wish of his wife [N.N.] for a shared accommodation]. He intends to take care of it soon.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Various reports are circulating about Emperor Charles V. It is now claimed that his friendship with Pope Paul III has been restored. May the Lord protect his church!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Bullinger recommends the young letter carrier [Konrad Forrer?], who is coming to Basel as a Zurich scholar to study. Myconius should assist him with advice and support. Otherwise, he should not burden himself with him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">Greetings.</p>
