    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Schuler was able to gather from Bullinger's last letter (which he received last Sunday [July 10]) how a reconciliation between Emperor Charles V and Landgrave Philip of Hesse had come about, but who was immediately imprisoned afterwards! From this event, as well as from what has recently happened, it becomes clear that the just God intends to punish people for their misdeeds.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] What is the use of preaching repentance daily and calling for a good way of life if one is not willing to renounce vice, and instead shamelessly and fearlessly commits one sin after another? Had the Ninevites not immediately repented upon the warning of the prophet Jonah, they would shortly thereafter have been destroyed like the inhabitants of Tyre and Sidon. But now, should God spare people who have been hearing His word not just for a few days, but for years?</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Hypocrisy cannot conceal wickedness. Even if people had no knowledge of the Bible, Roman history, or other historical defeats, they should have learned from everyday experience that they cannot endure with disobedience, discord, pride, and envy in the long run. There has hardly ever been a time as sinful as today. Especially in the Confederation, greed and the pursuit of bribes and gifts have taken over. Now, wealthy spiritual or secular lords, who would have previously been driven away with dogs and halberds, can present their concerns! Truly, the cardinalate for Johann von Weeze, the Bishop of Constance, will bring no advantages to the Church!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Schuler does not intend to express despair or hopelessness, but rather his concern for the well-being of the fatherland. Nor does he wish to comfort or frighten, especially since he knows well how much Bullinger, particularly since Zwingli's death, has countered these conditions with his writings and sermons. Schuler rather wanted to express his hope here that Christ will soon free His own from the power of the Antichrist through a Gideon or otherwise. Together with others who have not yet bowed to Baal, he is ready to sacrifice all his possessions, even his own life. For he knows that Christ, the captain, will punish these priests of Baal!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Bullinger should kindly accept the thoughts of an insignificant person like Schuler and maintain his goodwill towards him and others.</p>

      <p>My entirely willing service with the offering of all honors beforehand, venerable, especially dear lord and friend. From your recent letter, which reached me last Sunday, I have understood how the Landgrave was reconciled with the Emperor and then immediately handed over into captivity, along with further content. From this and other previous events, I can recognize and acknowledge nothing other than the true and unerring justice of God and the deserved punishment for our sins. For if God is just (as He truly is), the fault cannot lie with Him, but must be ours alone; for God does no one wrong!</p>

      <p>What is the use of daily preaching about repentance and the renunciation of sins if we not only refrain from past vices but instead shamelessly and fearlessly heap sin upon sin? Had the Ninevites only heard the prophet's warning (as you see we do) and not quickly followed it with repentance, their destruction would have been delayed only a few days; indeed, the warning and preaching would have been of no more use to them than to those in Tyre, Sidon, etc. Should God then spare us, who have heard His word not just for a few days, but for many years?</p>

      <p>Truly, the cloak of hypocrisy cannot conceal our wickedness. For even if we had no biblical scriptures, daily experiences (without the downfall and destruction of the Romans and other states) would teach us that our disobedience, discord, pride, envy, and contemptible nature cannot endure in the long run. For at what times (I now remain silent about other sins and vices, such as adultery, fornication, gluttony, blasphemy, hypocrisy, flattery, usury, etc.) has there been such shamelessness, especially in our Confederation, where everything is undertaken and arranged through insatiable greed and the desire for bribes and gifts? Which lord (whether spiritual or secular), even if he is our enemy, does not come, if he has not already arranged it through the distribution of money, to a hearing (which otherwise and still a few years ago would have been chased away with dogs or at least with halberds)? I truly fear that this other consecration of the Bishop of Constance will bring little benefit to our church!</p>

      <p>This, dear lord and friend, I write not as if I despair of our salvation or that I, along with all the good-willed, would surrender to the Antichrist and hope for no comfort, but so that you may see my concern and good will for the fatherland (how one might prevent harm and preserve and maintain against future evil). I also do not write this to instill any comfort or fear in you, who have so diligently and laboriously (for a long time now and especially after the departure of the dear hero and servant of Christ, Master Zwingli of blessed memory) countered these matters, as your writings and sermons sufficiently show. For I am of good and undoubted hope that Christ will now, since we no longer joyfully trust in any human help, very soon, and will rescue us from the power and might of the Antichrist, perhaps through a Gideon or in another way. To this end, I am willing to risk and offer my life, goods, and blood, yes, if it is God's will, gladly with others who, if God wills, have not yet bowed their knees to Baal. For I must hope that these priests of Baal will still find (experience punishment from) the brave captain Jesus, not without their great destruction! Amen.</p>

      <p>May you kindly note the best intentions from me, as it truly happens, and continue to show your goodwill towards me and others as you have done so far. With this, I commend you to God! Dated Wednesday before Margaret's Day, 1547. Your entirely willing Paul Schuler in Schwanden in Glarus. To the venerable, well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the city of Zurich, my especially dear lord and good friend.</p>
