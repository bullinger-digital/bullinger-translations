      <p>To Mr. Bullinger, leader (head) of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Reverend Mr. Bullinger, we have received your letter and very friendly offer along with the honorable gift, which Mr. Celio Secondo, the bearer of this letter, has brought to us in your name. We now commend him to you, and sincerely thank you and wish to express how much pleasure we have taken in your new message (news) written to us, as well as in your gift, along with other things that you will understand from him on our behalf, for which we commend you to his good and sufficient understanding and do not wish to detain you further.</p>
      <p>Our heartfelt request and earnest desire to you is that you will commend this aforementioned Celio to your trust as one who is well worthy of it and to whom the Lord has given much of His grace and gifts. He has a wife along with seven children, of whom he did not dare to bring four on this long journey due to their weak and tender youth, but left them here, while the other three along with the mother, if God wills, you will see with him.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we ask you by the honor of Him who has united us all in one spirit, that you will assist him where it is necessary, as much as you are able through God's inspiration; as we confidently trust that you will not neglect anything that concerns Christian love and mercy, with the earnest offer that, where we can show you and your friends kindness and goodness, we will be ready to serve you.</p>
      <p>No more, then may God keep you, Reverend Mr. Bullinger, in His divine grace.</p>
      <p>Given in Ferrara, on the 24th day of October in the year 1542. Ren√©e of France.</p>
