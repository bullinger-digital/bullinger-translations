      <p>My lord Bullinger, always most revered.</p>
      <p>Since nothing is more delightful and desirable for us Christians than the coming of our liberator and savior, our Lord Jesus Christ, for judgment, for on that most blessed day of all, we shall rise in glory, in power, and finally in spiritual bodies, and be caught up in the clouds to meet Christ in the air, and so we shall always be with the Lord, who will then transform the body of our humility to be conformed to the body of His glory, to possess forever the kingdom prepared for us from the foundation of the world. Therefore, the apostle says in the fourth chapter of the first letter to the Thessalonians: "Therefore comfort one another with these words." And Christ Himself, earlier in Luke chapter twenty-one, speaks of the signs preceding judgment: "When these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads (as a sign of joy), because your redemption draws near." From this, you can indeed infer with what joy of spirit and insatiable desire I have read and reread your pious and learned prayers about the end of the world and the final judgment, which our mutual and most sincere friend, Mr. Friedrich von Salis, gave me to read out of his great kindness towards me. He also showed them to his illustrious lords, his father and Johann Travers, so eager is he for the glory of the Lord, which is spread everywhere through you both by word and writing. What they said upon reading them, I do not know. But as for me, I know for certain that I cannot praise them enough, as the matter demands. However, I hope you will not attribute it to the fault of rashness if I presume to inform you of something concerning the papal kingdom, not to teach Minerva (the goddess of wisdom), but to see your opinion on it. Where you discuss the end of the papal kingdom, you affirm that it will reign until the very last day of this age and will rage against the church of Christ, and therefore the faithful of Christ must bear its yoke of persecutions and tyranny with a calm and willing, or rather patient, mind until the Lord comes. I do believe that beast, according to the testimony of Scripture, will reign in the reprobates until the end of the world; for until that day there will be papists who will follow the papal doctrine with utmost zeal and religion. But that the beast, the pope, will rage with persecution and tyranny against the elect of God until the day of the Lord, I do not dare nor can I believe.</p>
      <p>But I believe it will completely lose all temporal power, as St. John the Evangelist says in his Apocalypse, chapter seventeen: "The ten horns (by horns, as you well know, he means the kings of the earth, who give their power and kingdom to the beast, the pope, and fight with the Lamb, until they are consumed by the word of God, and who have fornicated with the whore Rome and drunk from the cup of her prostitution), which you saw on the beast, these will hate the whore, make her desolate and naked, eat her flesh and burn her with fire." If the kings of the earth (by whose horns the pope, the beast, persecutes the church of Christ) will hate the whore Rome, which is the seat of the beast, the pope, or his kingdom, and will make her desolate, eat her flesh and burn her with fire, then from this passage it is clear that the pope, the beast, cannot always rage against the children of God at his pleasure, but all his ten horns will completely fall from his head, must be plucked out and removed, and thus with the horns torn away, he will then be cast alive into the lake of burning sulfur. We see that this has already begun to be fulfilled in our times in many places and regions by the great goodness of God towards us, the professors of the gospel of Christ. For the pope, the beast, reigns in many provinces, as far as his doctrine is concerned, among his followers and adherents; but as for his power, that is, persecution and tyranny, because in those places his power has been removed by pious magistrates, he cannot rage against the pious, since in those places the horns have been torn from the head of the beast, the pope. And what has been done here, there, and elsewhere, I hope will happen everywhere in the world.</p>
      <p>You have understood, my lord Bullinger, what I think on this matter. But I ask two things of you: first, that you do not judge me rash for this, as I have already said, for your great kindness is the reason I dared to write this to you. Second, that you do not hesitate to share your judgment on this with me, if, however, you are not hindered by a multitude of affairs. I will add this before I finish writing, that I cannot sufficiently admire your great kindness, which you show towards me. For in all your letters that you write to Mr. Friedrich, you order him to greet me in your name. For this, I thank you greatly, for such a great man to remember me. Farewell, and do not be reluctant to convey my many greetings in my name to the worthy son Johann Travers von Salis.</p>
      <p>Samaden, May 23, 1557.</p>
      <p>Yours through Christ, Peter Bergomas.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his most revered lord. Zurich.</p>
