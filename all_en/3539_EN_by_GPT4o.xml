      <p>Kraków, March 16, 1558.</p>
      <p>Greetings and best wishes. A few days ago, dear friend and most esteemed master Bullinger, at the order and request of Mr. Utenhove, our mutual friend, I wrote to your kindness about a matter that is indeed less pleasant, but necessary and most useful for maintaining the peace of the burgeoning Polish church. Now, because I suspect the reliability of the couriers, I repeat it briefly.</p>
      <p>The old enemy of the cross and the gospel of Christ envies the peace, success, and happiness that this holy and newly born church has enjoyed until now. He sees his kingdom diminishing daily and the gathering of believers increasing.</p>
      <p>When he sees that he cannot harm this happiness through his papists, even though they fight vigorously for the kingdom of their prince, he stirs up turmoil and dissension through those who want to appear and be called members of the same church. Peter Paul Vergerius, a man otherwise born to fight against the papist kingdom, has conducted himself with little modesty in private disputes with some members of the church of Christ. However, bearing the holy and brotherly admonitions, which you, dearest Bullinger, Mr. I. a Lasco, and Utenhove wished to be conveyed to him, he wrote here to many of the noble faithful of Poland, accusing both parties. He complains that he has been unjustly harmed by letters written to you and promises to vindicate the injury through a public apology, which he threatens to publish shortly. Holy men see how much joy this will bring to the enemies and sadness to all the pious and good: therefore, they desire it to be calmed and settled by your admonition and authority. They pray that you admonish the man that his apology does not defend him, but rather disturbs the peace of the church and betrays his lack of restraint.</p>
      <p>He undoubtedly does not see how much harm he will bring upon himself. For he will not only lose the esteem he has had until now among the churches of Poland but among all churches if what could be written about him is made public. However, it will be necessary to make it public if he publishes his apology.</p>
      <p>Utenhove does not think he has written anything so dire that it is more worthy of private admonition than a public apology. But since he did not keep a copy of his writing, he asks that whatever the letters contain about Vergerius, you ensure it is faithfully transcribed and sent here as quickly as possible. He not only asks you to write this but also anything else that serves to confirm the peace of the church and defend his innocence against this attack. Anything that can be said about Vergerius's ambition serves this purpose.</p>
      <p>For it is certainly believed that he is more ambitiously seeking a legation to Poland by all means than that he is divinely called to this function. And if only he would desist from both the legation and the apology! For I do not see what else he could bring through his legation than what Bucer once brought to Basel and Bern; namely, a dissension that can hardly be erased with many labors. He promised the church not to undertake the Augsburg Confession; but with a changed name, he tries to introduce the corrupted Waldensian by Luther. You also seriously hinder these unworthy attempts.</p>
      <p>These are the requests of Mr. I. a Lasco and Mr. Utenhove, along with the entire church of Lesser Poland. My affairs remain in the same place as always.</p>
      <p>I eagerly await the privilege, upon obtaining which there is not a small hope of some profit. For there are also some nobles and citizens of Kraków who brew beer, who desire the craft. On the other hand, there are those who strive to be an obstacle to me and make every effort to make me desist from my undertaking. However, I consider all difficulties overcome if I obtain the privilege: otherwise, we have lost both effort and oil. Nothing has harmed this business of ours more than the untimely frugality of the lady from Ulm.</p>
      <p>For certainly, if the gifts to be imparted to the scribes had not been lacking, I would have long since obtained both the privilege and the not-to-be-despised benefit of the privilege; since our affairs are now in doubt as to whether the seal of the kingdom of Poland can be obtained: especially since our adversaries, who claim the invention of the craft for themselves, have promised five hundred florins to the chancellor if he obtains the privilege for them. But this alone consoles me, that the royal majesty has long since granted this to us.</p>
      <p>May God grant that it may someday be sent to me sealed.</p>
      <p>Please communicate this to Mr. Jacob Zwick if he comes to you. I commend my wife to your faith and protection: and I no less wish to commend to your kindness my relative John Billinger. Let him be admonished, I beg, by you and the faith and promise made to you in my adverse affairs: for certainly, if he does not lack the will, he could restore me to my former status. But this will not happen if he does not desist from drunkenness: for through it, he consumes what could help me and brings upon himself a premature death. I wish health to your most honorable wife, Heinrich your son, and the entire family.</p>
      <p>You will greet Mr. Peter Martyr and all the noble ones in my name. May the city and the entire church be safe and sound.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Given as above.</p>
      <p>If you ever wish to send your letters here for certain, you could send them to St. Gallen to the people of Wadt; for there is a citizen here named Hector von Wadt, a relative of the late Vadianus. If they are sent to him, they could always be safely delivered to me or Mr. John a Lasco.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>Yours as you know, I. B., the Englishman.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, wise Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my kind master, in Zurich.</p>
