    <p xml:id="regest1">The death of Pastor Hans Briner in Oberwinterthur is a heavy loss for the church and for many people. He requests, also on behalf of his fellow pastors, to assist the pious and educated Johannes Blum, Dean of the Winterthur Chapter and Pastor in Wülflingen, who lives with a large family in modest circumstances, in obtaining the pastorate in Oberwinterthur. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ.</p>
      <p>Lord Johannes Briner, bishop of the church of Oberwinterthur, departed to the heavens on the first of April, whom indeed the Lord took away by a death too premature, a very grave loss to his church, unless the loss of such a man, and thus a pastor, whom I know, may not be called a loss, far be it from the word envy, most vigilant. May the gods grant that our Zurich council appoints some good man to the same church, if not in all respects equal to the deceased, at least not inferior in piety and learning, who may teach both by word and by the purity of life.</p>
      <p>Which I truly desire from the heart and would easily believe myself to be granted my wish, unless my mind deceives me, if this task were entrusted to Florus, parishioner of the church of Wülflingen, dean of the Winterthur chapter. For he is a truly pious and learned man, to whom the Lord has given grace and wisdom more distinguished than many others, to beautifully administer this episcopal function. But otherwise, good gods, how short is the supply, how meager is the fortune, whose annual income barely supports the family. He is burdened with eight children and also has a mother still surviving of advanced age, poor and blind. Therefore, all our brothers here strongly commend this Florus of ours to your humanity, and the same thing voluntarily, as the gods may love me, to assist him as much as you can, if he seems worthy to you and to all of you for such a bishopric.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily and love your Lucius in return, who loves you most effusively.</p>
      <p>In the year 1537, on the third of the nones of April.</p>
      <p>I wish your dearest wife and mother with the whole family to be well.</p>
      <p>H. Lucius, yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant and foremost bishop among the Zurichers, his especially dear brother.</p>
