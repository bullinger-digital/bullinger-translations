    <p xml:id="regest1">Since he is opposed to the disputes over the doctrine of the Lord's Supper, he has written to Luther and Melanchthon, asking them not to disparage the [Swiss] churches any longer, as they agree with Melanchthon's "Loci" on the doctrine of the Lord's Supper and understand, as Bullinger's writings show, [the sacraments] not as mere signs. While Luther remained silent, Melanchthon admitted in his response that the Lutheran doctrine is harsh and rough; he is inclined towards concord, therefore Rümlang wants to ask him to express himself in more detail, and [the people of Zurich] should also turn to him; Rümlang expects that Luther's writings will be cleansed of insults after his death and asks Bullinger for his opinion. He does not know what the French King [Francis I] is up to, but expects turbulent times; our King, Christ, will support us. After Erasmus [Ritter] prevailed against a slanderer [Adam Heinricher], the pastors are now striving for peace; the [Bernese] church unanimously follows the teachings of Berchtold [Haller] and Franz [Kolb] or Zwingli. Greetings; Gwalther should take care of himself; inquiry about the new Bible edition [“Biblia sacrosancta”].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father, most esteemed Bullinger.</p>
      <p>You may perhaps know that the disputes among the churches and scholars are very distressing to me, especially those concerning the Lord's Supper, which have troubled many and offended not a few, with Satan seizing every opportunity to impose on the weak. And since it seemed to me that Luther unjustly attacks our churches not only with his writings but also with insults and slanders, I was moved to finally write to him and Melanchthon, stating that we are unjustly maligned; for we are pleased with Melanchthon's writings in the "Loci Communes" concerning the Lord's Supper, and no one speaks a word against them; we also share the same opinion and can sufficiently testify with your writings that we do not regard the sacraments as mere signs, and if Luther agrees with Melanchthon, then we are in agreement with both; therefore, the Church of Christ, our Redeemer, should be considered, and every effort should be made to abolish the name of contention, with an appeal to promote the common good; for otherwise, the enemies against the church are already rampant, and they should cease to slander us, etc. Luther said nothing, but Melanchthon responded very kindly and wrote to me among other things: "Regarding your question about the Lord's Supper: Certainly, I do not approve of the idols defended by the priests, the enemies of your and our churches, and I have diligently investigated antiquity. Although among us some speak more harshly or roughly than others, especially when disputes have flared up, the more learned feel and almost speak as I have written."</p>
      <p>Let us pray to God with common prayers, that He may remove all scandals, especially from our churches, and adorn and illuminate the glory of His Son. Farewell, most excellent man; I will write more extensively if you request it, etc. Given on the 25th of February" etc. I did not want to hide this from you, my Bullinger; for you see with what words and epithets Melanchthon adorns the form of speech of the Lutherans, which he describes as harsh and rough. Therefore, it seems to me that this man should not be neglected by you, who truly strives for concord; I do not know what the intermediaries have achieved; I think my one letter was not sent unsuccessfully, etc. I will observe Melanchthon; for I recognize a pious heart and will rightly venerate him and urge him to write more. I wish the same to be done by you, so that all offenses may be removed; for I believe that after Luther's death all his books will be purged of insults, so that posterity may exist free from contagion. Whatever happens, it will be fitting for all to strive for peace; for it is not the danger of one, but of many. Let us therefore be of the same mind, etc. Please, if anything else seems to you, write back, or if these things are approved by you, signify it, etc.</p>
      <p>I do not know what the King of France is attempting. I suspect great disturbances will occur in the following year. But let us be vigilant in prayers and implore our King Christ.</p>
      <p>May He deign to protect us, in whom we may be strong, so that whatever these Furies may plot, we do not delay, provided we strive for innocence, peace, and holiness; then He will foresee a happy outcome and a safe refuge for us.</p>
      <p>Erasmus had a serious case with a certain slanderer among us; but Erasmus prevailed. Hence the preachers are moderating their ferocity and also striving for peace. The doctrine is proceeding well; I know nothing to criticize. The entire populace, along with the leaders, is in agreement with the solid and hitherto handed down opinion and institutions of the fathers, Berchtold, Franz, or if you prefer, Zwingli, who established these, we do not deviate at all, and even less so, as they have come under suspicion of some innovation. Let us all consider everything with good will, so that peace and the honor of the church are not offended, etc.</p>
      <p>Farewell, all learned men of Zurich. May God assist your efforts, who always vigilantly strive to illuminate His glory, and have me commended.</p>
      <p>Gwalther should take care of himself, lest he perhaps succumb to excessive zeal, so that we may have him survive for a long time, etc. Also, indicate whether the Bible is ready, on which both Theodor and Pellicanus have worked. Greet everyone in my name. Farewell with your entire family, most excellent.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, on the 29th day of March in the year etc. 43. Yours, Eberhard von Rümlang.</p>
      <p>To the most upright and vigilant man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, chief pastor of Zurich, his ever-to-be-honored patron.</p>
      <p>To Master Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
