      <p>Greetings and peace through Jesus Christ, our Lord, and diligent commendation of my and my people's services.</p>
      <p>Our journey has been quite successful so far, by the grace of God. The young men from Mischkov have arrived safely at their intended destinations and have experienced prosperous success in establishing their affairs. Peter has been graciously received into the household by Prince Christoph, the son of the Elector. Nicolaus Jocziskus, moved by your letters, has admitted him into his familiarity, promising to be both a patron and a teacher to him generously. Now, our Johannes is being treated very kindly by Erastus on your behalf; he lives with him at the table for a weekly fee, and he resides nearby for 16 florins annually, although he must provide for his own firewood and laundry. Caspar, on the other hand, lives in a shared accommodation with others for 30 florins. I have provided him with decent clothing as best as I could, presented him to the prince and counselors, recommended him to the teachers and Lasicius, and thus, having successfully completed these matters, I have arrived in Frankfurt. We have heard nothing new so far; if there is anything later, Froschauer will report it, as he will remain here longer after me. Friends from Poland write that a new papal envoy has come to the king and has already achieved so much that an inquisition of books has been conducted by the king's order in Krakow, and many books have been intercepted by the adversaries.</p>
      <p>What this means or what will come of it, I will write to you when I return to my homeland, with Christ as my guide. Now, the Frankfurt fair and my urgent departure do not allow me to write at length. However, I have advised Datenius to write to you extensively about everything he considers worthy of your attention or has, which I am certain he has done.</p>
      <p>Farewell most happily, most esteemed father, with your entire family, whom I greet reverently.</p>
      <p>Given in Frankfurt, 17th September 1568.</p>
      <p>I have received everything from Froschauer that you sent and entrusted to him.</p>
      <p>Your most observant Christoph Thretius... with piety and learning... indeed a man of God... to Bullinger, the elder of the church... most faithful, lord... most esteemed.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
