      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord. Today I received two letters, one from my William, the Provost of Paris, and the other from our Vergerius. Both were very pleasing to me, and because they contain things that are worth you knowing, I decided to send you this hurried letter from the baths. William sends a small package of books, of which one or two also belong to you; I do not know whether our Marcus Rostius(?) will take care of bringing it or someone else, but I hope that after the Zurzach fair we will receive what he sends. He writes the following about the Venetians: "They are preparing a fleet of 50 galleys, which is to be sent as far as Corfu to explore Turkish affairs. The day before yesterday (the letter is dated the 4th of May) a frequent senate meeting was held about the commander of the fleet, who today was led with a large company of senators into a certain portico of the palace, splendidly and sumptuously decorated.</p>
      <p>In this, the treasury of the republic was displayed for the entire people to see, and a huge heap of coins was shown, by which they wanted to signify that the resources of the republic were by no means diminished, and they declared that all these were prepared to defend the republic. Other rumors are also spread; but because of the Imperialists, who intercept letters, it is not safe to write about each one." This from William. Vergerius, however, writes thus: "I am safe and sound, but I am involved in heavy labors and dangers; for on the night before the feast of the Ascension, some, imitating the example of Gideon, destroyed the relics of a certain Gaudentius, a papal saint or rather Baal, along with some images, and expelled the mass instituted by the word of God from their borders at Samaden, the Pharisees threaten me with exile; because I was summoned to give an account of my doctrine and defended myself in judgment (as Paul once did). Yet I am cheerful and fearless by the grace of God, I do not cease to preach boldly and every day I spread pamphlets printed in our language throughout Italy. I have decided to visit you shortly, to consult with you about some public matters; for the papists are growing stronger and are daily incited against me." I translated this from Italian on the spot, because he wanted the letters to be shared with you. As for my affairs, my father and esteemed relative, they are safe and sound by the grace of God, who is with me. I await your arrival, which will be more valuable to me than any gift. We enjoy great convenience due to the rarity of guests, although this convenience costs the host greatly, whose situation I lament. But this is the injury of the times, and the high price of provisions prevents people from flocking here to bathe in the baths. What William sends, you will understand from his letters when you arrive. If Marcus Rostius(?) has brought the package and letters, I ask you to speak to him in my name, inquire about the cost of transport, and pay it if he wishes; I will ensure that what you pay is reimbursed as soon as possible. Forgive me, I ask, for so familiarly seeking your help; for since your kindness has been known to me since childhood, I consider myself allowed to ask anything. I cannot write more due to the hasty departure of the messenger. I wish your wife and your entire family well, as well as my relative Huld[rich] with his Anna and Rodolf, whom I pray the Zurich church may have as a grandson worthy of such a grandfather. Farewell, my esteemed father and relative.</p>
      <p>My Regula sends greetings to all of you. Urdorf, May 22, 1551.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Rod[olf] Gwaltherus.</p>
      <p>The letters addressed to Calvin, which I received from William, were enclosed with mine; I send them to you so that they may be delivered to Bern or Geneva, because it is not possible for me to take care of it myself.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, his uniquely esteemed father and relative.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
