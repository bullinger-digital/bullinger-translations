      <p>S. D. I earnestly ask you, lord and brother, to ensure that this letter, addressed to the noble man from Stetten, a citizen of Augsburg, is delivered as quickly and safely as possible; you will greatly oblige me by doing so; I will try to show my gratitude to you if any opportunity presents itself. You have surely heard, even among you, about the severe illness with which I was afflicted by the Lord.</p>
      <p>The Lord struck me with the plague in three places; the doctors, otherwise diligent and skilled, despaired of my life. Meanwhile, such great mourning, weeping, and sorrow arose among the entire people that I would never have thought this would happen because of me, a wretched little man. Supplications were instituted in the church.</p>
      <p>I immediately felt the vital spirit returning.</p>
      <p>In short: I have no doubt that I was granted life through the prayers of the church. I only wish that I may someday meet the expectations of the church.</p>
      <p>You, with yours, pray to the Lord for me.</p>
      <p>The severe pain in my badly affected right side and head still troubles me in the sixth week; I hope to be restored someday. From my bed, I write this to you, my dearest friend, so that you may know my situation for certain.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, while I lie here gravely ill, my dearest wife, the pride of women, is seized by the same illness and passes away on the ninth day.</p>
      <p>You understand how much grief this has caused me; however, since she entrusted her spirit to Christ in true faith among her sons, daughters, sons-in-law, and servants, I know that I have sent her ahead, not lost her.</p>
      <p>You will share this with your father, a man I always respect and love. Greet him and the venerable brother ministers, as well as Liner, Rotmund, and Sigismund Zollikofer, and other friends. Farewell excellently.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 24th October 1564.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the pious, honorable Josua Ke√üler, city scribe in St. Gallen, my dear lord and good friend. St. Gallen.</p>
