    <p xml:id="regest1">Bucer wrote from Speyer, without addressing the Diet, but a nobleman reported more details about the troop contingents intended for the Hungarian campaign; among the various rulers, only the French [King Francis I] limited himself to fine words. It was initially said of Bucer that he had traveled to Speyer, then that he had been secretly summoned to Cologne by [Archbishop Hermann von Wied] and subsequently visited [Landgrave Philip of] Hesse, while his companion [Johannes] Sturm returned home; the latter reported that the bishop had demonstrated his [Protestant] disposition, among other things, by rejecting certain rites - such as at the baptism of the young Count [Eberhard] of Manderscheid - and wanted to reform the church based on the Holy Scripture. Myconius cannot write more due to headaches. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Regarding the Diet of Speyer, although Bucer recently sent letters from there, he did not mention a word about it. However, I received the following information from a nobleman here: Concerning the army, it was agreed that 40,000 infantry and 8,000 cavalry would be sent to Hungary in the name of the Empire. The King promised 28,000 of his own. Similarly, the Pope is to provide a certain number. They say about the Danish and the English that they too will do their duty. The Polish are taking care of themselves. Thus, there is no prince who will not contribute his due effort, except for the French. For he has settled everything with fine words. These are the things I can write about this matter. I remained silent about Bucer because I did not know the whole matter he dealt with, and I still do not know. I had heard at first that he had gone to Speyer together with the envoys from Strasbourg, soon called by the Archbishop of Cologne, but this should be known to no one. After a long silence, someone wrote that he had left the bishop to go to Hesse, while Sturm, who had been his companion, returned home, but did not mention a word about what had been done. However, it was said that he explained as follows: firstly, that the bishop had a very good opinion about religion and had proven this with certain actions. He lifted the young Count of Manderscheid from the sacred font together with another count. He ordered that the papist priest should take pure water, omit the exorcisms, chrism, and salt, and read everything in German so that those present could understand. In the blessing of the table, he uses prayers and thanksgiving, but without the cross, saying, "What is blessed by God should not be contaminated by man." Because of the crosses and exorcisms, he does not attend mass.</p>
      <p>He does not allow a priest or monk in his presence. He said that the church should be reformed, but not from the canons nor from the fathers, but from the scripture of God as from a touchstone. Everything else is unknown.</p>
      <p>I could write so little due to severe headaches. Farewell with your family in Christ. Basel, March 22, 1542.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>I wish Theodor and Pellican well in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
