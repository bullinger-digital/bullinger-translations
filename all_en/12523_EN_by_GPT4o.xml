    <p xml:id="regest1">The pastors and teachers of Zürich have received the letter written by Landgrave Philipp of Hesse on June 5 in Friedewald [No. 2455] with the news about the slanders spread against them. They welcome the Landgrave's efforts for peace in the church, thank him for his favor, and wish him God's support.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- The Landgrave should know that they do not, as is claimed in Hesse and Saxony, call [Martin] Luther godless from the pulpit or during instruction, even though they are well aware that Luther referred to them as worse than the Turks and the Jews. On the contrary, they strive to be edifying by instructing the people only in Christian doctrine.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Upon closer investigation, the Landgrave would rather find that slanders against them circulate in Hesse and Saxony, and they are defamed as Zwinglian iconoclasts, enthusiasts, and sacrament desecrators. This is done, for example, by Theobald Thamer in his teachings in Marburg, in the Landgrave's own city!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- They have also never claimed that Luther died of grief because he did not know how to refute their [True] Confession [of 1545]. They do not have the habit of slandering the deceased, not even insignificant people. All the less would they now want to speak ill of Luther, who was so deserving for the Church of Christ! With the exception of his teachings on the Lord's Supper and images, as well as some of his inappropriate writings [against Zwingli], they always defend his honor. Now that he has passed away, they would only publish further treatises on the disagreements if they were attacked by others.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- It is also not true that they do not tolerate those who adhere to the [First Helvetic] Confession worked out in Basel and sent to Luther. Unlike many Lutherans, they recognize this confession. However, they cannot tolerate it being interpreted differently from what it originally intended to convey. Furthermore (thank God!), they have not had to expel anyone over the Lord's Supper dispute, as they are in agreement on this matter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- Had Luther not attacked them, they would not be in the current unfortunate situation. They prefer peace over confrontation and will continue to behave peacefully.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">- In summary: They have neither publicly slandered Luther among themselves, nor do they intend to take revenge on him, nor are they less inclined than the other [Swiss Protestant] city [cantons] to adhere to the [First Helvetic] Confession. Rather, they teach that in the Lord's Supper, the believer is not only given bread and wine, but the true body and true blood of Christ, though not in a physical, but in a spiritual way, especially since Christ's body remains at God's side. Nevertheless, Christ feeds the believer with himself, so that Christ lives in this one and this one in Christ [John 6:56]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">- Despite everything, the spiritual nourishment they teach is criticized as insufficient. They are demanded to acknowledge a physical nourishment! But they cannot do this. And even less could they claim with Luther that in the bread the real, natural body of Christ is present and that it is received both by the godless like Judas and by the saints like Peter! Except for the doctrine of transubstantiation, Luther expresses himself like the Roman Church. This shows that the dispute is not merely due to the use of different terminology, but rather to opposing views. For to claim that Christ is physically present, that he is physically eaten with the mouth, and that it is beneficial to eat his flesh physically with the mouth, is fundamentally not the same as claiming that Christ is physically absent, that he is spiritually eaten with faith, and that it is not beneficial to eat his flesh physically!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">- Nevertheless, the [Zürichers] seek the unity of the church and are willing to work for it, as long as they are not required to assert something they do not believe and cannot justify before God, as this would cause confusion among the believers. They are ready to show their love and spirit of community to all those who do not consider them enemies in Hesse, Saxony, and elsewhere, and who, like them, advocate the doctrine of salvation through faith alone and not (as the Antichrist does) through other means.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">- The Landgrave should receive their letter well and defend them before the Elector [Johann Friedrich of Saxony] and all the other princes where they are slandered. They, in turn, are always ready to justify their faith and promote peace. They further commend the Landgrave to God's protection.</p>

      <p>Illustrious, high-born prince, gracious lord, your princely grace has our humble, willing service at all times beforehand.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Gracious lord, your princely grace's letter, written on the 5th of June from Friedewald to our dear Heinrich Bullinger, has reached us, concerning certain slanders, allegedly issued by us against Doctor Luther of blessed memory, publicly spread, has been received and well understood. We thank God, our heavenly Father, that He has instilled in your princely grace such zeal to promote the honor of God, as well as the unity and well-being of the church. We also express our great thanks to your princely grace for the friendly writing and faithful warning, as well as for the love and favor that your princely grace has shown us undeservedly and abundantly. May God grant that we could also show your princely grace love and goodness. We pray to God the Lord that He may strengthen your princely grace in all good things and increase His glorious gifts at all times.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Therefore, we ask for a gracious hearing of our innocence, which we now briefly and truthfully report to your princely grace. That we have ever publicly declared Doctor Luther of blessed memory from the pulpits or in the lectures or otherwise in the churches, whose servants we are, as an idolater, is unjustly reported to your princely grace; for we have not done so before nor do we do so now. And whatever disputes we have ever had with Doctor Luther, who called us idolaters, unchristians, damned, obstinate people, enthusiasts, heretics, sacrament desecrators, and worse than Turks and Jews, we have never mentioned his name or those of his followers from the pulpits with dishonor or slander, but have led the Christian teaching for the betterment of the people without quarrel, indicating thereby what of our teaching, taken from the word of God, is not similar or conforming, is erroneous and not to be accepted, whoever may introduce and protect it; for God's word alone remains forever. We can confidently rely on the testimony of the entire church, whose servants we are.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Your princely grace will thoroughly learn, upon inquiry, that we are publicly slandered by many in Saxony and Hesse, as your princely grace is informed, that we have done to Doctor Luther; for many preachers direct the greater part of their sermons to the people against the Zwinglian iconoclasts and sacrament desecrators, enthusiasts, and blasphemers. Herr Theobald Thamer in Marburg, in your princely grace's city, also has it in common practice to speak little good of us and ours in his public lectures, though undeserved and unmerited on our part, whereupon we humbly request your princely grace to graciously put an end to such injustice as much as possible; for we are also not inclined to wrong anyone, and are willing, where we write or act, that if anyone feels wronged and informs us of it with God's word, to follow the better. Likewise, we have not issued from Doctor Luther that he died miserably and from grief because he could not answer our confession, and we deeply regret that your princely grace is troubled by such unfounded words from our side, to our detriment and disgrace. We have always had a great aversion to slandering and defaming deceased people, even those who are not particularly deserving; so far is it from us to want to attribute a slander to Doctor Luther, who has shown his service to the Lord Christ and the church not insignificantly nor unfaithfully; except for the matter of the Lord's Supper, the images, and that he sometimes wrote uncleanly (which we do not hold against him so highly), we give him his due honor and would not allow, as far as our power extends, that he be slandered by others. And now that he has been called by the Lord, we would also gladly let the contentious points rest, unless we are drawn into it by others and compelled to say what has happened to us and what has driven us to the dispute and our last writing. Yet we also then use appropriate discretion, hoping to find all good understanding among all honorable people.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>We are also very unjustly treated in this matter, that your princely grace is told that those who want to adhere to the confession drawn up in Basel and sent to Doctor Luther should not be tolerated by us; for no one has ever been expelled or driven away by our gracious lords because of this matter. It has also not been necessary by the grace of God among us so far, as the authorities, servants of the church, and the entire community are of one understanding and well united in the matter of the Lord's Supper. We would have much more reason to complain here that our confession, as it is set forth in Basel, and the teaching as we lead it, is not everywhere, where Doctor Luther's blessed books are valid, given place and security, indeed not tolerated. We ask your princely grace to graciously consider this. We do not oppose the confession set forth in Basel and sent to Doctor Luther, as long as some words therein are not interpreted and explained differently than they were set forth by us with sound understanding.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>And as far as Doctor Luther of blessed memory and his followers have left us alone in this matter and have not attacked us with slanderous writings and pressed us in such a way that we could not proceed for the sake of honor and duty, the misfortune would have been avoided. We are deeply sorry that your princely grace has been accused of such discord at the imperial majesty's court, of which we bear no guilt and would have much preferred peace. We also want to conduct ourselves according to your princely grace's desire in the future, peacefully and properly, so that, God willing, we will not give any cause for new quarrels, but we cannot prevent it if other people start with us; we also cannot then leave the truth, the church, and our own, dead and living, unprotected.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Doctor Luther has not been slandered by us so far, as your princely grace states, nor shall he be slandered with falsehood, therefore there is no need to abolish untruthful slanders. We are not eager to repay evil with evil, slander with slander, much less to seek our own victory. We are also willing, gladly, and honestly to remain by Christian teaching, as it is set forth in the confession in Basel and later clearly stated by us in our last confession or response to Doctor Luther, no less than other Christian cities in the common confederation, and to persist with God's grace. For, as your princely grace states, we confess in the holy supper of our Lord Christ not only bread and wine, but that the believers also eat and drink the true body and true blood of Christ, though not physically, but spiritually through faith, so that the body of Christ remains at the right hand of God and does not come down, yet we are nonetheless fed, nourished, and sustained with and through the Lord Christ and no other food, so that He lives in us and we live in Him, as we have fully confessed and explained in our writings.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>However, we have not been allowed to remain by this so far, and we are still slandered as sacrament desecrators and those who only teach signs, indeed as enthusiasts who cannot teach or learn anything right about faith. Meanwhile, we are demanded to silently acknowledge the spiritual nourishment as too insignificant and to confess a physical presence of Christ, etc., which we cannot do with God and the truth, nor can we hold, as Doctor Luther taught, that the Lord's bread is His true natural body, which the godless or Judas receives just as well orally as St. Peter and all the saints; for thus, as now heard, his words sound. We now remain silent about the fact that he and some of his followers have publicly let it be printed that they hold the sacrament in every way and manner (except for transubstantiation) as the Roman church. This burdens us unjustly, we cannot accept or approve of such, nor speak or sign such. And it seems to us entirely that the dispute is not only in words but also in the matter itself; for to be physically present and not physically present, to eat physically with the mouth and to eat spiritually with faith, that the spiritual eating of Christ's flesh is beneficial, and that the physical eating of Christ's flesh is not beneficial, that the body of Christ is everywhere in the supper and that the same body is now at one place at the right hand of God, that the Lord's bread and drink is a memorial and sacrament and that the same is not only a memorial and sacrament, but that it is truly the memorial and sacrament, are indeed contradictory things that cannot exist together; therefore, the dispute and strife of words is not without cause and temptation. The necessity and clear truth compels us.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>Our heart and mind stand faithfully for Christian unity and we have always offered to do everything that is appropriate for Christian people and faithful church servants, as long as we are not forced (as your princely grace undoubtedly does not desire) to say or allow what we do not understand, nor can we make others understand. We must always act clearly and understandably before God in His church according to His word, not introduce contrary things, confuse the understanding of the simple, and cause offense with our inconsistent words; therefore, we do not look at our own temptations in this matter, but at God, at clear, understandable truth, and at the edification and preservation of the church. Herewith we offer all loyalty, love, and unity to all those, whether they are in Hesse, Saxony, or elsewhere, who bear no ill will towards us and who, like us, preach the Lord Jesus Christ, our only Savior, and proclaim the salvation of people through faith alone, and not (as the Antichrist does) through other means.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>We ask your princely grace for God's sake to graciously accept this our apology, and also to graciously defend us before the Elector's grace and others where we are accused, not to believe immediately when we are accused, but to graciously hear us, as has now happened. For we offer ourselves, at all times, as much as with the truth (which people have nothing to give up, whose disadvantage your princely grace undoubtedly does not desire) to give a proper answer, when we are called upon. Yes, we are all ready, willingly to do everything that we can with God and is in our power, to honor, serve, and love your princely grace, and to always help plant peace, favor, and love between the rulers or authorities everywhere. Therefore, we have also presented your princely grace's Christian, kind-hearted writing to our gracious lords with a fervent request to write back to your princely grace in a friendly manner. Herewith we commend your princely grace to God's almighty protection and care, with humble prayer, that your princely grace may always have us in grace.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, 27th of June, in the year 1546</p>
      <p>Your princely grace's entirely willing servants, pastors, readers, servants of the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the illustrious, high-born, Christian prince and lord, Lord Philipp, Landgrave of Hesse, Count of Katzenelnbogen, of Dietz, of Ziegenhain and Nidda, etc., their gracious prince and lord.</p>
