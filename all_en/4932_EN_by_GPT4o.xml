      <p>Greetings. The brevity of time does not allow me to discuss more with you.</p>
      <p>Know therefore that Mr. Martyr departed from here on the 26th of this month, which may be fortunate and auspicious, to France; Mr. Coignet will escort him through Burgundy to France, with whom the most honorable magistrate of this city has dealt.</p>
      <p>Pray with all the pious to the Lord, that He may bless the journey and the entire affair. Serious dangers are arising among the Rhaetians: the Pope and the King of Spain, having sent envoys, are altogether trying to expel the Gospel from the Valtellina. It is said that 28 ships have transported the Spanish army to Genoa.</p>
      <p>The Venetians are fortifying Bergamo for some unknown reason. There are those who suspect that the Spaniards, along with the Duke of Savoy, are plotting something against the Kingdom of France, to disrupt the plans of the pious. Therefore, the pious must be vigilant and especially pray to the Lord.</p>
      <p>If you hear anything and have certain information from France, please share it promptly, I beseech you. What response was given to the envoys of the Agronians, they themselves will explain.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever.</p>
      <p>Your fellow ministers and brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 30, 1561. Greet the brothers. In great haste.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. John Calvin, faithful pastor of the Church of Geneva, his most esteemed and beloved lord and brother. Geneva.</p>
