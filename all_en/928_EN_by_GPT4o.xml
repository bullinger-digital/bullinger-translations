      <p>Greetings. I am not surprised, most learned Bullinger, that you are indignant, given the disturbed state of affairs, that we are arming ourselves for fighting or rather quarreling, both sacred and profane.</p>
      <p>But indeed, if you examine the matter more closely, it is necessary to dissent, unless you wish to voluntarily give way to serious offense. The ministers have enclosed us in this game (to speak freely, but with good faith), who, without any preface from either your church or other churches of our religion, defend their obstinacy with such a stubborn opinion, that with that one and indeed Christian liberty, the authority of the senate was compelled to maintain its agreement with you and to make it pleasing to the people and the common folk. However, the state of the cause, in our opinion, revolves on this one pivot: whether by the law of God permitting, that is, not at all averse, the grandchildren and granddaughters can have the right to free marriage or not? And, if it is free, it is not permissible for the magistrate to establish differently by his law; if it is not, it is right for the divine law to be vindicated and held by his laws and edicts, no matter how madly those who abuse sacred matters for their own convenience may rage. Our senate, most lovingly of pure religion, sincerely and earnestly prays that you may untie this Gordian knot for us, and I implore you, Bullinger, to help us, through Christ the Lord. My mind is free from all distress in this matter; I equally favor both parties, but what is uniquely dear to me, I desire to be consulted by divine law. But enough of this.</p>
      <p>Regarding Uriel, I would kindly like a response. For I confidently promise myself that your people will do something worthwhile, since the young man is of such proven character that I promise myself the best about him. Farewell.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, the fifth day of June, in the year 1550.</p>
      <p>Joachim Vadian (von Watt).</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the holy church of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and friend above all to be honored.</p>
