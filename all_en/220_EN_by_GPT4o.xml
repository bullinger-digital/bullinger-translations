      <p>God's grace be with you! Dearly beloved godfather, I have nothing special to write to you at this time; I am waiting daily for letters from you. Today my gracious lord has learned about the situation in Constance; all posts on horseback and on foot have been occupied, and all bailiffs have been instructed to prepare and be ready for the next decision; similarly, letters have been sent to Freiburg and Solothurn. Today around 10, the post left here again; it will be in front of the council in Zurich tomorrow. Praise be to God! Everyone is comforted and willing; they recognize well what we deserve if it should come to a new conflict, but they hope for God's mercy, that He will not let the defiler of His word succeed in all his matters. Whatever is present, let us know in a timely manner for God's sake; the post will always be going. Blaurer was somewhat mistaken when he wrote this letter, which I am sending back today. May the God of all comfort give you strength and protect you from the terrible yoke! My gracious lords here will be willing to do everything that is proper and within their power for the matter. I truly hear no evil. Let us only pray earnestly; we have a faithful and true God, He will not abandon us. I would like to see how they would act to be a comfort to the honest people in Constance and not leave them.</p>
      <p>I am sending you the Vocabulary, in case you want to add or change anything in it. Artopaeus also writes to you about it; he would like it to be printed by Apiarius, if you agree. We all, including the schoolmasters with whom we have spoken about it, are very pleased with it.</p>
      <p>Ismael has greatly offended our lords, as he, the most unlearned of all, dared to take a wife; he has been dismissed from his stipend and will not be received again unless he shows some good sign of his repentance.</p>
      <p>Abel may perhaps be recalled shortly. We will support Schnevelius as much as we can if there is greater hope for him, and he should not think himself neglected if others are recalled and he is ordered to remain; rather, he should persuade himself that he is being nurtured for greater things.</p>
      <p>The treasurer Haller, who shows himself to me as a very close friend and almost as if he were truly a relative, recently entrusted me, among other things, to write to you as soon as possible, to greet you very much in his name, and to add that he finds it strange that, although you once used to be so familiar with him, you have not addressed him with any letters for a long time; he believes that he has been slandered to you and made somewhat suspect; he wishes to be cleared in your eyes, and it would have been your duty (if this is true) to admonish him if you have heard that he has become different from what he was before. I ask you to write to him; he is a man of great influence, and I would like to draw him to our side in any way I can, and I hope I can achieve something with him, as he seems to greatly enjoy my friendship (unless he is pretending).</p>
      <p>On the 13th of August, a day has been set for all the people of Lausanne to appear here before the senate and give an account of their disputes. I would have liked to mitigate Viret's case, but behold, in the meantime, while these things were happening, he himself published a booklet in the French language about the power and use of the ministry of the word of God and the sacraments dependent on it. From this booklet, certain things were extracted and translated into Latin and sent to us by Zebedee, which again irritated everyone's minds; for there are certain things that are completely contrary to us, some doubtful, confused, and obscure, some true, but not written at the right time and place. For it was not appropriate to irritate the hornets more now, so I greatly fear for him; for otherwise, he is pious, lest he also be dismissed and sent away. I will take care to transcribe those chapters and send them to you soon.</p>
      <p>In Musculus's case, nothing has been done in the meantime. Others have already read his writings and wonder that we wanted to impose on them someone who wrote such things against the dispute. These writings displease me as they do you; but I know he did not do it with a bad intention and will not do it again, as he understands (as you also write) what the outcome of this concord is. Certainly, there is no hope that he will be received here unless he clears himself with some writing or stays with you for some time. I wish he could be retained in Zurich with some support for at least a few months until suspicion of him ceases! I heard he went to Constance and there received his wife and children; perhaps he is stuck in those troubles. I will not write to him until I know where he is. You want to know what he writes to me. I am sending the letters themselves; return them after you have read them. We are not satisfied with these letters here.</p>
      <p>This is all for now; I will give more with the next message.</p>
      <p>Farewell. Greet your entire family and all the brothers in my and my wife's name. August 8, 1548. Bern. The brothers who are with us greet you.</p>
      <p>Your entirely, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest lord and godfather. Zurich.</p>
