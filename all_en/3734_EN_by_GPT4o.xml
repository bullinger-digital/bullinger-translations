      <p>Greetings. I am sending you a letter written by Mr. S. Laurentio [Bochetel], who is now a bishop. Mr. Constable has come to the king with given faith, and now deputies from both princes are negotiating peace, about which I dare not affirm anything for many reasons. Philip's army retreated a distance of three miles and, on the day it departed, due to the weather, lost two thousand men and a thousand horses. I hope to see you within three days, and we will discuss more in person.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, farewell.</p>
      <p>Greet all friends.</p>
      <p>Baden, October 20, early morning.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To the most learned theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a singular friend.</p>
