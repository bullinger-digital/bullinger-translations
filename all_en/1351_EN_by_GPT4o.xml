      <p>Greetings. You wrote in time; for it had spread throughout the entire city that peace had been made between the Pope and the French, and although this seemed impossible to me, I nevertheless believed it somewhat due to the consistency of the rumor. Meanwhile, your letters arrived, which explained the true situation. Regarding the Venetians, Mr. Vergerius asserted that there was no hope and that it was typical of their character, as they do not take up arms in such cases unless they see that the French will be inferior; for neither the Pope nor the Emperor can tolerate anyone greater than themselves. I understood this character when Ochino, who is now in England, was still here. Indeed, I easily believe both of them, as they are both Venetians and were educated among them.</p>
      <p>Regarding the council, our people prepared themselves in such a way that they were about to leave for you on the next Sabbath; as a sign of this, they sent the bull of Julius, the speech of the papal legate made before the Swiss, two writings of the Emperor, the letters of your senate, and their own letters, which they had once sent to the Septempagians about the same council, so that after seeing them, we might respond with what seemed right to us. Amorbachius, the rector of the academy, presented all these.</p>
      <p>We were amazed, we read, we set the twentieth of July as the day on which we wanted to deliberate on the proposed matters. Meanwhile, a courier from ZÃ¼rich arrived and the assembly replied. The magistrate immediately sent a senator to announce these things; thus, we have refrained from consulting as we had planned up to this point. However, each one acted for himself: he wrote the articles of his consultation up to the point of discussion, so that we might be prepared if anyone should demand anything from us, and as far as I understand, there is no one who wants to waste effort and oil here.</p>
      <p>Besides this, Mr. Vergerius told something about a large Turkish fleet and that the Pope fears it might make an incursion into Italy. I have been led here by many lies, so I believe none of what is said about the Turk; for even if there is some truth, the Emperor immediately sends with his brother, overwhelms with new gifts, to satisfy his own desire, so that he is almost forced to desist from his purpose.</p>
      <p>The consul from Nordhausen sent letters that peace had been made between Maurice and the Magdeburgers; he writes one condition, that they should be under the duke like other cities of the duchy, Leipzig, Wittenberg, etc. The same was written by a great man from Frankfurt; I do not know if it is so.</p>
      <p>Maurice could not have been captured if he made peace with them in the city of Dresden when convened by the Magdeburgers.</p>
      <p>Farewell with yours in Christ. Basel, July 22, 1551. I am very pleased to hear what you report from Italy.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most learned man, most esteemed friend in the Lord.</p>
