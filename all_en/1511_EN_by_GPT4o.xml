      <p>S. in domino. Stop wondering; there was no occasion or reason to write, nor was there a convenient messenger. Now, given the reason, it pleased me to write this: In England, everything is in turmoil; the king's protector has been captured and executed against the king's will; there are imperial intrigues; these people wish to expel Christ from England and cause trouble for the French. Georg Laetus was with us these days, who reported that the people of Magdeburg have excellent conditions for peace. They have dismissed half of their soldiers, keeping the rest with them, having little faith in the conditions of peace. They are completely freed from the priests and are now beginning to rebuild the walls and erect stronger fortifications, gathering provisions for several years. The Duke of Mechelen, along with the remaining nobles, has been released, who daily in his captivity listened to evangelical sermons and now begins to be most hostile to the priests; if he does this with a sincere mind, he is to be praised, if with a feigned one, he will have a reward worthy of his hypocrisy. They say he wanted to secretly occupy Erfurt; but he was thwarted. He withdrew to the land of the Bishop of Hildesheim with his soldiers; it is rumored that the soldiers are to winter in the lands of the bishops by order of King Ferdinand, whom he is to lead to Hungary in the coming spring; about which we will hear more certain news shortly. I thank you for the news from Hungary. It is certain that a monk has been made a cardinal because of the betrayal of Transylvania. There will be a cruel war between the king and the Turk. From the letters of Lord Lazius of Vienna, I have this: "A certain rumor has it that the tyrant of the Turks (unless Almighty God prevents it) will invade with innumerable troops in the coming summer, with this being prepared and cared for by the most hostile enemy of the Christian name, your king, or rather Henry of France. Therefore, we are placed between a rock and a hard place; but we hope in God, who has already granted our king several victories in Hungary against the Turks, along with all of Transylvania unexpectedly. For I cannot doubt that the best and greatest God will hear the prayers of the princes, who in public supplication so devoutly for a whole hour publicly prayed on his knees, which his chamberlains report to me he does privately every day. I am also consoled by certain very old prophecies I have found, in which there was mention that in the next year, 1552, the Turk will suffer a great defeat in Austria. Among these is one written in elegant verse on parchment more than 400 years ago, and I still have the original:</p>
      <p>From the lineage of Philip will descend a Caesar, Who will justly avenge the world's wickedness with a sword. He will lay low the French, scatter the Venetians and the Britons, Whoever turns his arms against such a leader. With unanimous sense and eternal zeal, He will establish the worship of the triune God. He will reform everything that fierce Frederick and his Cruel offspring and his own follower have overthrown. And you too, depriving you of the unjust diadem of the kingdom, He will compel, Turk, to come to the true faith. He will place the Roman apostolic power over the lambs, Thus the Greeks in Rome will endure the burden And he will draw to Christ the followers of Mahomet and Mars. Thus there will be one shepherd and one cause. When three times five centuries have passed since Christ was born. And twice three new suns and years will be, It will be the time under which Charles, the honor of the world, and its own glory, will burn Cremona and Crema." This he said. I do not believe the poems are old; perhaps they thus deceive the princes. Farewell. December 23, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Gastius.</p>
