      <p>As far as I can surmise from the words of the Lord of Chur, he was not only unaware that the whole of Thurgau was supposed to be closed to me, but also that the administration of the parish of LÃ¼tmerkingen had been denied to me. Indeed, some think that the other four places also have no knowledge of this, but it is solely the practice of a few people like the governor of Tobel, Diethelm Blaurer, and Heidenheimer with the bailiff of Schwyz. I would like to know if you might inquire with the Lord of Chur, whether he was aware of the other matter and was present when the service of the churches in the Five Places was laid down for me in Thurgau; for if it were known that this was solely the practice of a few, there would be less danger involved. A messenger from Basel told a good man: the Five Places not only want to exclude me but also my dear brother's son, which I cannot believe; for it would be entirely against everything that was allowed to the judicial lords in Thurgau, that each according to his situation may appoint his parishes where he is the patron, therefore they have not put forward any uncolored reasons against me, why they cannot tolerate me there, since they cannot accuse me of not having conducted myself according to the peace of the land in my preaching. I do not voluntarily bring danger upon myself, being otherwise most certain of the protection of my Lord and heavenly Father, who for so many years has deemed me, a man of no account and a most worthless worm, worthy to be placed among his ministers, not the least of them, and has always embraced me as a most tender son, so that often, though exposed to the most immediate dangers, I have never felt any penetrate to the quick, nor have I suffered prison, chains, iron, fire, hunger, thirst, or anything of the sort for the glory of Christ, always eluding the bloody attempts of my enemies by the counsel and strong hand of the best Father, so that I have nothing here to glory in, with the holy apostle and many others, but to always reverently kiss the bosom of the most indulgent Father, in which he has held me so gently.</p>
      <p>To Him be glory through Christ forever! If it is His will that, as a veteran and emeritus in the confession of His name, I should pour out this spirit among swords or flames, here I am, ready, provided the invincible Spirit of Christ is with me and He is glorified through my death.</p>
      <p>Winterthur, March 2, 1564.</p>
      <p>I myself have nothing, except that in Constance and elsewhere the adversaries boast greatly of a council, hoping that under its yoke all who are counted under the Christian name will submit their necks, however resistant, and that by force and arms (if they will not otherwise) compelled by the greatest monarchs of the Christian world.</p>
      <p>For they boast with the greatest certainty that the King of France has subscribed to the decrees of the most holy council; but this is not new to those who are not only vain but have become men from vanity itself, so that they most impudently boast that what they earnestly desire to happen has already happened. But the joy of the hypocrite will remain momentary and utterly fleeting...</p>
