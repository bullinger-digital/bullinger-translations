      <p>To Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, a most learned man and his dearest friend, Richard Hilles sends greetings.</p>
      <p>These are my words, most learned man, by which I inform you that your letters dated March 14 of the last year reached me after the death of our John Abel, along with a letter from Dr. Rod. Walther dated the 17th of the same month, both written to me in the absence of the aforementioned John Abel, and delivered into my hands. For this reason, I opened and read the letters, and I delivered the letters along with the books, which you mentioned in them, to those to whom you directed them. Furthermore, I received letters from July 16, 1569, and certain works separately bound and consigned to the Bishop of Salisbury, the Bishop of Ely, the Bishop of Worcester, and to Sir Anthony Cooke, as well as some booklets for each of them, which I took care to deliver with the codices to the aforementioned men. I wish to inform you of all these things. Your letter, dated August 24, was also delivered to me: and since you seem to be dealing with me in the same about letters to be delivered by you to others, and others to be sent to you, I will take the place of our friend Abel, who has died in the Lord and is now blessed and freed from the labors he suffered in this world, (I have no doubt,) and I will do the same as best as I can with a willing mind. As for those writings, which you mentioned were attached to mine, I delivered them as soon as they were brought to my hands to the reverend bishops and other learned men to whom you consigned them. However, I was certainly grieved when I perceived from your letters, which you sent to John Abel, that although you were not tormented by stones in the bladder (as he was), you were nevertheless troubled by the same disease in the kidneys, so that from St. Martin's Day to March 14, you passed 60 stones, some of which were quite large. Yet I rejoice that, although you suffered greatly from that kind of illness, you have been granted such patience by divine providence, which I pray to God will remain with you to the end.</p>
      <p>Two years ago, I sent you a letter, the content of which I extracted verbatim from a letter written by someone to Dr. Christopher Mont of Strasbourg, which informed him of the state of Lower Germany, especially of Antwerp, shortly before the arrival of the Duke of Alva. I sent a second copy of this letter to the Frankfurt Fair in 1568, included in my letters to you, (so that it might be delivered to some bookseller in Zurich to be transferred to you.) Since you did not mention a word about them in your letter of August 24, 1569, I suspect they were lost rather than delivered to you, and therefore I include a second copy in this letter of mine. When you write that letters from there to you, if brought by my efforts to Dr. Christopher Mont, will undoubtedly reach you, I rarely find that the reverend Bishop of London, Edmund G., can be of much help in conveying them to the aforementioned Dr. Christopher Mont. For I often used to assist in transferring their writings to Dr. Christopher Mont and to you, as long as it was possible to send letters through Lower Germany.</p>
      <p>However, for an entire year now, we have not sent any letters to any learned men through Lower Germany, which would be imported into Upper Germany or Switzerland, so that they would not be opened there; thus, we are compelled by necessity to arrange for letters to be conveyed to Hamburg. Therefore, until this controversy, which has arisen long ago between our most serene queen and the king of Spain, has ceased, I think that both you and the aforementioned Dr. Christopher Mont will receive very few letters from here, except from the Frankfurt Fair.</p>
      <p>I thank you for informing me of the news that was in Switzerland and in the borders of France concerning Switzerland. Here, however, there is no news to write about with certainty, except that two earls, namely of Northumberland and Westmorland, (as I suppose you have heard some days ago,) whom the royal majesty ordered to appear before her honorable counselors in the month of December last year, to clear themselves of the suspicion of a conspiracy premeditated by them against the religion and faith proven by the Holy Scriptures, and established by the authority of our most serene queen for at least 10 years, have raised a rebellion, and they, along with some subjects of the queen inhabiting the bishopric of Durham, over which Bishop Pilkington presided, whom they incited to battle, have wickedly taken up arms. However, the remaining subjects in other parts of the region, by the notable grace of God, as was fitting, remained in duty; they cultivated peace, and lived piously under the rule of God and the queen. And those who lived near the bishopric of Durham rendered service to those noble men whom the queen had sent to suppress that tumult. And so they pursued those two earls and their entire army, so that the earls themselves and some horsemen who accompanied them fled to Scotland, where they were captured by Lord James, the governor, and a certain nobleman named Hume; so that I hope they will soon be brought to England, and there, I do not doubt, they will be punished with the fitting penalty that their deeds demand. While the aforementioned were in arms defending their impious attempt, they not only overturned the tables of communion, tore apart the sacred Bibles, destroyed pious books, and trampled printed homilies underfoot; but they also wickedly restored the mass as a sacrifice for the living and the dead.</p>
      <p>And to better cover their feigned piety, they had crosses and certain insignia of some saints, whom they believed or pretended to be their patrons and defenders, extended among their arms.</p>
      <p>As for our friend Dr. R. Walther, when he asked John Abel about how much English cloth called "kersey" is worth in England, and how many German ells it contained, I ask you to understand from these my words that our kerseys are of different prices and different lengths; the common and coarser ones are 28 or 30 ells of Frankfurt or Strasbourg, and each is worth about 8 or 10 French crowns: and the dyeing or coloring of each piece of cloth called kersey in woad will cost two and a half or 3 French crowns.</p>
      <p>Before I sealed this letter, we received certain news that the aforementioned Lord James, the governor of Scotland, was struck and killed by a shot from a certain nobleman of the Hamilton family with a gun (called "bux" in German).</p>
      <p>Farewell in Christ Jesus, my most esteemed lord, who always keeps you! Amen. London, the sixth day of February, in the year 1569, according to the computation of the Anglican Church.</p>
      <p>Yours, R. Hilles. To the most learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my dearest friend, let these letters be given.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
