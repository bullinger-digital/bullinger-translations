    <p xml:id="regest1">[Megander and his colleagues] read their letter of comfort and admonition with great emotion. However, he could not comply with their wish to remain in Bern, even if he had not been dismissed because of the catechism, as his opponents are also reviving the long-resolved dispute about his conduct during the time of the [Second Kappel] War; therefore, he hopes for approval of his unwavering decision to return to Zurich before Candlemas, and once again requests the provision of accommodation.</p>

      <p>Grace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Your friendly letter, which we received, whether persuasive, consolatory, or remonstrative, was so pleasing to all of us that words cannot express it; for it could not be read by us without great tears. We have found it to be true, as the proverb says: "The loyalty of friends is tested in adversity."</p>
      <p>However, regarding the matter and the business itself: I am not unaware that it would indeed be most appropriate for me to comply with your request this time as well, and to stay longer in Bern. But when I weigh and judge everything precisely, as it is said, it ultimately prevails that, even if it were allowed, I should neither endure nor linger here any longer. And this is not only because of the business and the catechism, but also because of those things which everyone judges to have been long since settled and laid to rest by the decree of the senate and the people. For everything that was done during the time of our most deplorable war is being revived and exacerbated by certain disturbers of public peace. Although it is known to all mortals what was done, committed, and transgressed, they nevertheless try to reproach and impose it on me with great harm, and thus they move every stone to either take revenge or to seem to have a just cause for the given dismissal. Therefore, it seems advisable not only to me but also to the divine glory and our church, even if I could endure and linger here longer, to once and for all set sail from here and return to you. I therefore beseech you by our Lord God, that you assist me in this and that it may be done with your consent. This is my firm, fixed, and unchangeable decision. Therefore, I will hasten my departure without any further delay. I beg you, as I have testified to you in many recent letters, to ensure that I have a house and accommodation. I will certainly be in Zurich with all my belongings until Candlemas.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord, my dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>Bern, the last day of December, 1537.</p>
      <p>Megander, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and pious Bullinger, Leo Jud, ministers of the word of the Zurich church, my dearest lords and brothers in the Lord.</p>
