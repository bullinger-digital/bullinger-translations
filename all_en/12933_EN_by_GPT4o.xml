    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller received Bullinger's letter from the day before Easter [No. 2877] on the day before Quasimodo Sunday, in which Bullinger had answered four of his letters [HBBW XIX, No. 2821; No. 2837; No. 2844 and a lost letter from March 14]. Since Bullinger wants to know more about the capture of Margrave Albrecht Alcibiades of Brandenburg-Kulmbach, Haller encloses a copy of a letter written by Georg von Reckerode. Although Georg Frölich considers this account to be disorganized, it contains much valuable information. Reckerode is one of the most important commanders of Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony and almost as experienced as Sebastian Schertlin. Haller will report other glorious deeds of this man later. Haller cannot write anything precise about the extent of this victory, as the reports are contradictory. It is certain (as already reported in the letter [from March 14]): Duke Moritz of Saxony had 12 companies laid down.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony recently filled about 60 covered supply wagons with arquebusiers and let them pass by Dresden. The hussars, whom Duke Moritz of Saxony had left behind in the city, attacked the supposed supply wagons. Suddenly, the provisions came to life! 400 hussars were killed. The rest fled in disgrace.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Elector Joachim of Brandenburg sent Duke Moritz 500 cavalrymen. As they rode past Wittenberg, they were all cut down by the garrison there.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The imperial troop leader Martin von Rossem conquered the city of Minden. The local councilors helped him. After he withdrew, an uprising broke out among the population. The most important council members were beheaded, and all supporters of Emperor Charles V were expelled.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] An Augsburg [...] reported from Hamburg that the people of Augsburg and Ulm are hated there. He owes his survival only to the fact that he is well known in the city and has respected relatives.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] It is reported from Strasbourg that Jakob Sturm does not dare to venture onto the street. The cities that have paid homage to the emperor must deliver a lot of artillery to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] In Frankfurt, some council members are said to have conspired to hand the city over to Landgrave Philip of Hesse. Maximilian von Egmont, Count of Buren, learned of this and captured 16 councilors. As a result, the imperial forces have strengthened the guards in the cities they occupy (such as Augsburg).</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Bernhard von Schaumburg, the imperial colonel of the garrison stationed in Augsburg, accused the mayors Jakob Herbrot and Hans Welser of still being in league with Schertlin. The colonel, who has attended Haller's sermons twice, regretted only Haller's Swiss origin so far. His confessor [...] diligently reads the mass. He has such a large following that he will probably soon be assigned a church.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Haller does not like writing to the council of Zurich, as he fears that his letters will be interpreted unfavorably. If only the council behaved like an honorable father and called Haller and [Thoman Ruman] back to Zurich at the first opportunity! For he would rather die honorably in Augsburg than return home in shame! At the latest, after Haller's two-year service obligation expires, the council will have a good reason to recall him. Many honest people take pity on him, especially since he endures among a foreign people. They believe that he can decide on his departure himself. Everything is entrusted to God! A recall would be nice. If it does not happen, may God help him to faithfully carry out his office until death. If he writes to the council again, it would be a sign that he is in distress.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] It is known to everyone that King Francis I of France has died. Strange that Bullinger did not know about it in his last letter [No. 2877]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Martin Frecht wrote that Pope Paul III is dead and the Augsburg Bishop Otto Truchsess von Waldburg has been called [to Rome] for the election. What Bullinger reported about the 7000 Italians [moving to Germany] is said to be a false rumor, as the letters from Venice, Genoa, Mantua, Milan, and Parma report nothing of the sort.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] Some claim that the emperor is still in Eger, while others say he is returning to Regensburg because the Bohemians are refusing him provisions. This is probably also a lie.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Haller recently saw a print made in Venice about the sixth session of the Council of Trent, which dealt with justification by faith. Since then, he has not been able to find another copy. The publication was sent from Padua. Frecht reported that there is already a print about the seventh session, dedicated to the sacraments. However, Haller has not seen it.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Thomas Naogeorg has written a learned poem about the new papacy introduced by the Lutherans. Haller will send a copy of it as soon as possible.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] Wolfgang Musculus and Michael Keller were very touched by the offer of help from the people of Zurich. They reciprocate it, in case the people of Zurich ever need it. May God prevent that!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest16">[16] Greetings from Sebastian Lepusculus and Ruman. Bullinger should share news about the Confederates. It is heard that they are arming themselves. Everyone inquires about it from Haller, but he cannot provide any verified information. Greetings also from Sixt Birck and Nikolaus Müller known as Maier, with whom Haller now lives in the college [St. Anna]. Greetings to all colleagues. Haller would be pleased to receive at least a line from Konrad Pellikan and Theodor Bibliander. It now seems likely that the Augsburg library will lend the manuscript volume with writings by Philo of Alexandria to Konrad Gessner.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest17">[17] [P.S.:] The bearers of the present letter [Daniel Moser, Johannes Nisaeus, and Hieronymus Peyer] are recommended to Bullinger! They are scholarship holders of the Augsburg church. They were actually supposed to be sent to Tübingen, but Haller and Birck managed to persuade the council to send them to Basel. They would have been sent to Zurich, but they preferred (as all young people do) a university. But praise be to God that they are gradually getting enough of the Wittenberg enthusiasm!</p>

      <p>Greetings through our Savior Jesus Christ. I received your letter, dated the day before Easter, eight days later, on the day before Quasimodo Sunday. You responded to four of my letters. Among other things, you ask me to describe in more detail the capture of Margrave Albrecht. To ensure you have accurate information, I am sending you a copy of a letter written by Georg von Reckerode, one of the top commanders of the Elector, Johann Friedrich of Saxony, and a man almost as experienced and renowned as Sebastian Schertlin. He himself participated in this conflict and accomplished other notable deeds, which I will report later. Although he wrote without order, as Laetus says, the information is very noteworthy. There are so many rumors here that I cannot write the true extent of the victory. However, as I wrote in my previous letter, 12 companies of Duke Moritz's troops were defeated.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>The news I have heard since is this: Duke Moritz captured some hussars (light cavalry from Hungary) at Dresden. The Elector had about 60 supply wagons well covered and filled with arquebusiers, and let them pass by Dresden, which the hussars noticed. When they attacked, thinking they were going to plunder the supplies, the provisions came to life, and they killed up to 400 of them, with the rest fleeing in disgrace.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Elector Joachim of Brandenburg sent Duke Moritz 500 cavalrymen. As they were not far from Wittenberg, the garrison there attacked and killed them all.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Martin von Rossem, who leads his own troop for the emperor, captured the city of Minden with the help of the local council. However, when he moved on with all his forces, the community in the city rose up, beheaded the most important council members, and expelled everything that was imperial from the city.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>An Augsburg resident in Hamburg wrote that if he were not so well known and related there, he would have been killed, as they are hostile to everyone from Augsburg and Ulm!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>From Strasbourg, it is reported that Jakob Sturm does not dare to go out on the street. The cities must now deliver a lot of artillery to the emperor.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>In Frankfurt, some council members have reportedly conspired to hand the city over to Landgrave Philip of Hesse. The Count of Buren, who is stationed there, discovered this and captured 16 council members. It is uncertain what will happen. As a result, the guards have been strengthened here and in other cities.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>The colonel stationed here told the mayors to their faces that it is not good: Schertlin and they are still under the same cover! He has attended my sermon twice. He complains about nothing except that I am Swiss. His priest diligently holds mass. Many people go to him. I fear he will soon be assigned a church.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>I do not like writing to my lords, as I fear they will hold it against me as before. I wish they would act like fathers, preserving their and our honor, and recall us when the opportunity arises. I would rather die honorably here than return home in shame. My years are almost up. Then they can help me and themselves with good reason. I know many honest people who are concerned that I endure among this people. They think I have more freedom to leave than I do. I entrust it all to the Lord. If my lords recall me, I will be glad; if not, may God grant me the grace to fulfill my duty faithfully to the end. If I write to my lords again, it will be a sure sign that I am in distress.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>It is common knowledge that the King of France is dead. I am surprised you did not know about it when you wrote your last letter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Frecht wrote to us that the rumor is that the pope is dead and our bishop of Augsburg has been called for the election. There is nothing to it, as you wrote to me, about the 7000 Italians. Letters from Venice, Genoa, Mantua, Milan, and Parma mention nothing of the sort.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>Some say the emperor is still in Eger, others that he is retreating to Regensburg because the Bohemians are not allowing him provisions. I do not believe it, as the emperor's men spread unheard-of lies to make their situation seem better.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>The decree of the sixth session of the Council of Trent "On Justification" has been printed in Venice. I have seen a copy, but I cannot obtain another. It was sent from Padua. Frecht writes that the seventh session "On the Sacraments" is also available. However, I have not seen it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Naogeorgus has written a very learned poem about the new papacy, namely that of the Lutherans. As soon as I have the opportunity to copy it, I will send it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>I do not remember having anything else new, except that Musculus and Cellarius are very grateful to you for offering your services to them, and they would do the same for you, should it ever be necessary (which God forbid!).</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div16" corresp="regest16">
      <p>All the brothers greet you, especially Lepusculus and Romanus. If you have any news, please let me know; various things are being said about the Swiss preparations. Everyone wants to hear certain news from me. I therefore ask that I may have from you what I can tell others. Sixtus and Nicolaus Maior, with whom I now live in the same college, also wish you all well. Greet all the brothers and fathers in my name. I would like to receive at least one letter from Pellicanus and Theodor, if they have time to write. Please tell Gessner that I have great hope of obtaining Philo the Greek from the library. Farewell. April 19, 1547, Augsburg. Yours sincerely, Johannes H.</p>

      <p>I commend to you the young men through whom I send this letter. They are alumni and scholarship holders of our church. They were to be sent to Tübingen, but I, together with Sixtus, persuaded the school authorities to send them to Basel. They would have been sent to Zurich, but they, as young people do, preferred to be at a public university first. Praise be to God, they are beginning to endure the Wittenberg enthusiasm. God be praised, although we are not entirely pure.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and excellent man, Heinrich Bullinger, supreme head of the church in Zurich, his lord and father to be revered. Zurich to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
