    <p xml:id="regest1">Maier thanks for the dispatch of [Johannes] Haller. He is all the more recommended to him as Bullinger assured Haller that he could count on him. - Haller's companion [Huldrych] Zwingli [the Younger], who resembles his father so much, was also most welcome to Maier, even though he could not properly take care of him. He returned from a mission to Augsburg on the day he received Bullinger's letter [not received] and on which Zwingli [the Younger] and his companion [Hans Wilpert Zoller] were to depart in the evening. Since he has already been assigned a new mission and has [several] letters to write beforehand, he must be brief and will entrust his little letter to [Georg] Fr√∂lich for further delivery. - He commends himself to Bullinger's prayers.</p>

      <p>Greetings in Christ Jesus, dearest brother. You have done me a most pleasing favor by recommending Haller to us. Even though, due to his learning and piety, I would always wish to commend him to myself with a sweet and unique love for such pious and good men, he is especially commended to me because of your recommendation. And he will find that you have not promised him much from me in vain; I will assist him with my advice, as you advise, and I will not cease to protect him with my support.</p>
      <p>It can hardly be believed how much that young man, his companion, the son of the divine Zwingli, whose features he entirely resembles, was most welcome to me; to whom I cannot impart the goodwill I wish to impart. For on the evening of the day these letters are dated, both the young man and his companion decided to depart from us.</p>
      <p>I returned home from a mission of the republic and found another mission to the assembly of our religion's factions already decreed; due to the haste of these matters, I could not write to you as much as I would like. For I have a useful subject to write about, and before my departure, I will write letters and will ensure that our mutual friend Letus sends these to you with the first available courier.</p>
      <p>Farewell and support me with your prayers to our Creator. Greet all our friends. Dated November 22, 1545.</p>
      <p>Always yours, Nikolaus Maier, etc.</p>
      <p>To the man of highest learning and piety, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, ecclesiastic of Zurich, his dearest brother.</p>
