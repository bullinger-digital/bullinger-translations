    <p xml:id="regest1">Provides information about the teacher of Christoph Klauser's son: It concerns a somewhat inexperienced apothecary who demands a high tuition fee from him, while the best apothecary in the city would train him for free; Dasypodius therefore advises changing the apprenticeship and also refers to Bedrot's parallel letter. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. You and Bedrot wish to be informed by me whether Christoph Klauser's son is making any progress in his work at our apothecary. To put it briefly, as soon as the young man arrived here, I was very surprised why, having passed by more renowned places, he chose to serve in this particular workshop. And if I had not believed that there were some reasons of familiarity between Doctor Christoph and this apothecary, I would have already advised the young man not to bind himself to a man who, even if he is otherwise honest and upright, nevertheless, as is certain, could hardly obtain permission from the senate to run an apothecary in our city due to his lack of skill in the art. This is also easily inferred from the fact that while others have quite renowned workshops here, he, due to the infrequency of his own workshop, meanwhile devotes himself to selling spices; I refrain from mentioning that, as far as I understand, he demands more tuition from his students than anyone else. Indeed, to sum up the whole matter in one word: The one who is considered to hold the first place among the apothecaries in our city seriously (for he has much familiarity with me because of my roommate, his nephew from his brother) told me that he would be willing to instruct such a young man for free, if given the chance, much more faithfully. Therefore, dear Bullinger, regarding this matter, if Doctor Christoph wants to do what is best for his son, he will not allow him to waste both money and time any longer with such a master. I write this with good intentions, not because I begrudge my fellow citizen any profit he might make through the young man, but because I most willingly wanted to comply with your wish to know these things, and I earnestly wish to warn Doctor Christoph about his loss. I believe Bedrot will write not much different things, and he will add other matters that were to be reported.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and do not cease to love me as you have until now. Greet all the brothers and friends with you, especially Leo and Pellicanus.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, on the sixth day before the Ides of July in the year 1537.</p>
      <p>Petrus Dasypodius.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, an upright and learned man, Antistes of the city of Zurich, his dear brother and friend.</p>
