    <p xml:id="regest1">Erb does not want to bother Bullinger with empty chatter, as the apprentice [Hans Vogler the Younger] is going to the baths of Baden and will meet Bullinger. - Even though some want to harm the church built by Erasmus [Schmid], it remains uncorrupted, not least thanks to [Count Georg of Württemberg]. - In Montbéliard, however, [Johannes] Engelmann is raging, wanting to reform the church after the Wittenberg model. [Pierre] Toussain remains steadfast. The deceitful preacher Pantaleon Blasius, sent there from Stuttgart, has not fulfilled his duties and has abandoned his congregation. - [The "True Confession" or the "Orthodox Confession of the Church of Zurich"] is eagerly read by all the pious, while the blindness and intransigence of [Luther] are criticized. Perhaps God wants to give more weight to the Eucharist through this. Erb will never forget the words of Zwingli, which he spoke after his return from the Marburg [Colloquy] during a walk with [Leo] Jud and Erb (who had been sent from the Bernese brothers from Aargau to [Zurich]): Luther would rather turn to the Anabaptists than join the [Eucharistic view of Zurich] faithful to the Holy Scripture. Zwingli has prophesied accurately! - If the [Latin special edition of Bullinger's "Resurrectio"] has appeared in small format, the [Zurichers] should send it via [Hans Vogler the Younger]. - Greetings from Nikolaus König and especially from [Sigismund Stier], chancellor of [Count Georg]. Greetings to [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Kaspar] Megander, Erasmus [Schmid], and [Konrad] Pellikan. - [P.S.:] At the Imperial Diet [in Worms], no prince has negotiated so far, except [King] Ferdinand [I.] with a few little bishops. The expected [Charles V.] is moving slowly away from Brussels. [Sultan Suleiman I.] is said, according to the testimony of the [Common Penny collectors] active in [Alsace] and neighboring areas, to be on a great campaign. According to a letter from [Kaspar] Hedio to [Count Georg], [Jost Dietz?] wrote from Poland that [Sultan Suleiman I.] is leading an army of over 80,000 men. The Spaniards have advanced from the Vosges over the Kochersberg, crossed the Rhine near Strasbourg, and are marching to Ulm, where they will be transported by ships on the Danube to Hungary. The Swiss and [Alsatians] no longer need to fear [them]. - According to a letter from a Tridentine [...] to Beatus Rhenanus, the General Council is postponed to the Greek calends.</p>

      <p>Grace of the Lord be with you.</p>
      <p>Since our scribe is going to the baths of Baden and will meet you, most honorable man, I did not want to burden you with my lengthy and inept chatter. He will tell you everything more clearly than I can write.</p>
      <p>Here, by the grace of God, we remain steadfast in our righteous endeavors, even though there are those who, as usual, invite us with flattery to subscribe to some unknown opinions. And the more they flatter, the more diligently we guard against them.</p>
      <p>In summary: As Erasmus Schmid established this church correctly, it has not lost its form, even though many want to adorn it with masks.</p>
      <p>We teach true piety to the best of our ability and those things that contribute to edification. We encourage and urge, in season and out of season, towards integrity of life and a life worthy of a Christian. We dispense the symbols of religion and Christ with utmost faith and reverence. Moreover, the prince, fulfilling his duty, assists us vigorously.</p>
      <p>However, the church in Montbéliard is still wavering and is being attacked by a harsh battering ram. For Johannes Engelmann, or rather Satander, is raging as usual, wanting to reform the church according to the Wittenberg model. Pierre Toussain, however, remains steadfast and true to himself, even though he is deprived of all human help, and he makes light of his threats. There was a certain learned preacher, Pantaleon Blasius, a native of Stuttgart, sent to settle the dispute; but the man, deceitful and cunning, has so far nurtured the monster, as he has not executed the tasks entrusted to him to settle the matter and has defected from the church whose patronage he had undertaken. We all grieve. Our scribe will write about these things. Your apology against Luther is eagerly distributed and read by all the pious. Many deplore the blind blindness, or rather the inflexible obstinacy of that man, whose works God has hitherto used in many matters. But who knows the mind of the Lord? Perhaps God has seen fit to exercise his own in this way or to make the symbolic supper, the memorial of Christ's death, more illustrious (like a lily shining among thorns) to all the children of God.</p>
      <p>It remains deeply embedded in my mind when the good Zwingli, having returned from Marburg (a few days later, when I was sent to him by the Bernese brothers in Aargau in a difficult matter for consultation, and while we were going for a walk after supper, both I and Leo and the other learned men - among whom I was like a goose among swans), mentioned that conversation, saying: "I have recognized Luther in such a way: Before he stands with us regarding the sacrament, which is not ours but that of the scripture, he will sooner fall to the Anabaptists." I have observed that statement as if it were an oracle of Apollo and have often testified that Zwingli was endowed with a prophetic spirit at that time. But enough about this. I wanted to put an end to the letter, but I have already exceeded.</p>
      <p>If the booklet on the resurrection of Christ has been printed in small format, let it be sent to us through this person.</p>
      <p>Farewell with your family and church, brother in Christ, most honorable and beloved. Nikolaus König and all the brothers, especially the chancellor of the prince, greet you. Greet all the brothers in our name, especially Rudolf Gwalther, Kaspar Megander, our Erasmus, and my contemporary Konrad Pellikan.</p>
      <p>In Riquewihr, the day before the calends of May 1545. Yours most devotedly, Matthias Erb.</p>
      <p>At the Imperial Diet, nothing worthy of memory is being done, nor is any prince, except Ferdinand with some sordid little bishops, acting there.</p>
      <p>The emperor is expected, who is advancing from Brussels at a snail's pace. The Turk is said to be on a great expedition, according to the tyrants who are extorting the people around us and our neighbors and extracting a huge amount of money. Someone wrote from Poland, as I understood from a letter written by Kaspar Hedio to the prince, that he has an army of over eight hundred thousand men. If true, they would surpass the number of locusts. The Spaniards recently advanced from the Vosges over the Kochersberg, crossed the Rhine near Strasbourg, and are heading straight to Ulm, where they will be transported by ships on the Danube to Hungary. You and we Swiss are freed from fear, etc.</p>
      <p>Beatus Rhenanus reports that a letter from an Italian from Trento, once known and familiar to him, states that the General Council is postponed to the Greek calends. Would that the day would come when the great angel of the council would judge the world in equity and the peoples in righteousness, which is Jesus Christ! But where am I carried away? Farewell.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, especially in piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant bishop of the church of Zurich, his very dear brother.</p>
