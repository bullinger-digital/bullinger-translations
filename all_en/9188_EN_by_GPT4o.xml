      <p>Greetings. In recent days, I have received a second letter from your piety, the first through Samuel Curnerwell, an Englishman, and the second through this public rider of your city. As for that Englishman, he stayed with us for two days, during which time we provided him with what we could. I could do little because of the illness that still holds me.</p>
      <p>However, regarding the gift sent by your republic to Geneva for the aid of the poor, I would have preferred it to be sent here first, as I hear there are few French in Geneva anymore, and they will hardly share anything they have once absorbed with those who still live in large numbers in the territory of our city.</p>
      <p>As for Belliureus, he astonishingly bewilders some of our people, so they do not willingly listen if anyone speaks ill of him; for they assert that he is compelled to do what he does for his king; separately, they say he detests the king's actions among friends and laments them with tears.</p>
      <p>But what kind of people are they who blow hot and cold from the same mouth? They also affirm that he loves the Genevans and still works for them among the Swiss, so that they might either be received into the league or, if this could be done, that it might at least be free for the Cantons (who wish to undertake this) to take them under their protection and patronage, and they say he has achieved this with the people of Lucerne and Zug; for he has summoned some of them to the monastery of St. Urban in the jurisdiction of Lucerne and also some of ours to Frauenbrunnen. However, these things are still being done secretly; our people are hopeful that not a few Cantons will take up the patronage of the Genevans; it is also hoped that the Valaisans will join them. They say he is turning this stone in the name of his king, perhaps, as some judge, so that the king might thus commend himself to our people again after such a wicked deed, or, as the more perceptive easily foresee, he does this not so much out of love for the Genevans, but so that in this way he might also indirectly draw us into the king's league. Keep these things to yourself until it is seen what outcome the matter will have.</p>
      <p>We have heard nothing yet about the emperor's death. Beza writes to us about fiery armies seen in Lyon over the Saône, but he does not confirm it; likewise, uncertain rumors are spread that Boulogne near Calais has been intercepted by the Huguenots; but he does not give credence to this either, nor would I believe it, because this rumor had already been spread here some time ago. Steiger sends his greetings to you in return and is glad that the wine he sent is good, and asks that, as soon as it can be done, another be sent to Glarus and that you inform him of the transport costs, so that he can make sufficient payment for them. All of ours also send their greetings to you, Diesbach, the treasurers, Hagenberg, the father-in-law, and the widow of Telamon, who thanks you for remembering her and asks that you commend her to the Lord through your prayers.</p>
      <p>Greet all of yours in my name, especially Gwalther, Simler, Lavater, and your sons.</p>
      <p>In Bern, on the day of Charles celebrated among you, 1573. Johannes Haller, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the truly faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
