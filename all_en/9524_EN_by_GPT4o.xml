      <p>Most Reverend Father, I have received all your letters written to me at different times, along with the Gantnerian proceedings and the new reports from Belgium and France, all diligently taken care of.</p>
      <p>I am most grateful that, despite being heavily occupied with your own affairs, you do not neglect the duty of writing to us. We, as much as we can, strive to reciprocate by gathering new information from Italy for you; furthermore, we continue to send the cases handled by Mr. Haller of our court. Meanwhile, I have had many other tasks to complete, and therefore we have been somewhat slower in the task we began. I will send the final proceedings soon, God willing.</p>
      <p>Today, the sentence against Gantner was confirmed by a larger senate, and I believe he will be expelled, leaving only his children and wife here. He will not go far from his disciples, whom he has misled, so that he can more conveniently harass us.</p>
      <p>Marius, that most troublesome critic, is also being expelled from the domain of the Three Leagues, and the grace period granted to him is set to end with these Christmas holidays.</p>
      <p>For when, during the last peasant uprising, he was asked by his peasants to support such outbreaks, he arrogantly and insolently replied: 'Why should I support them? You Rhaetians have never committed any remarkable deed.' The peasants, amazed by his nature and slander, accused him and recalled some of the remarkable deeds of the Rhaetian ancestors. He, adding to his slander, said that such deeds deserved the noose. Consequently, he was reported to the new president, Mr. J. Georg von Marmore, and after reviewing these slanders, he was forced to undergo the sentence of exile. It pains me that these two, who are otherwise not unlearned and could have rendered excellent service to the churches of Christ, have so disgracefully conducted themselves that it is more a cause for rejoicing than sorrow if they are banished to the farthest Indies, so that they do not involve more people in their errors, which they partly secretly nurture and partly spread to others. Marius has shown himself so frivolous in the matter of Sabbath observance that he has led most of the peasants of his valley to make no distinction between feast days and other days, working on feast days just as on others, though at certain times, but not necessarily. He also threatens to write against some of the modern writers who have written about the Sabbaths within a decade and to bring their various errors to light, etc. But why do I trouble you with these irregular minds? We pray to the most good and great God that He may allow you, the most ardent and illustrious light of His church, to shine for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>All of ours, whom you have greeted, return your greetings and wish you a particularly happy and blessed new year.</p>
      <p>Most quickly from our study, December 29, 1573. Your most devoted Tobias Egli.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man in piety, learning, and every kind of virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, his singularly esteemed lord.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned Mr. Bullinger, pastor at the Grossmünster in Zürich.</p>
