      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear friend. We send you herewith the old and new news, expecting that soon new tidings will come, which perhaps are not expected. Farewell in God's care. Dated Schaffhausen, the 27th of June, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>New tidings. The Turk advanced on Transylvania on the 27th of April with 70,000 men and on the 21st of May sailed with 300 sails and ships to Sicily or Naples. The King of France is encamped at Martin von Rossen, skirmishing daily. The Kingdom of Naples is rebellious and partly turned French. I would not withhold this from you, graciously. Dated Passau, the 13th of June, in the year 1552.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] of Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>Such was written by Count Friedrich von Castell among other things as true news.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
