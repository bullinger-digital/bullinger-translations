      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. You see what I have dedicated to your name, most illustrious man. I pray, however, that you accept my effort and gift, whatever it may be, with the same spirit with which I offered it most amicably. For I am ready to diligently serve you and other distinguished men like you. I urge you, continue on the holy path of the Lord; virtue is immortal and truly ennobles. We are created in the image and likeness of God; we must reflect this integrity and holiness in all our plans, words, and deeds; this should be the goal of our entire life. The Lord will be present with His own, who seek and invoke Him from a true heart; He has enough strength to protect against enemies. Hence, truly only those are considered secure and invincible, who, being grafted into the Lord, have the Lord as their protector. I wish you and all yours to be well in Him. Zürich, 28 August 1539.</p>
      <p>The one who offers you this, the former mayor of Chur, has remarkably refreshed my spirit, and his piety, sincerity, and modesty have greatly pleased me. Would that our Switzerland had more such mayors! You will commend me to him. May the Lord be with you.</p>
      <p>Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Johannes Travers, his most esteemed lord.</p>
