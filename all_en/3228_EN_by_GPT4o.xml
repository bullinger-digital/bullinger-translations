      <p> I eagerly await your son, dearest and most learned man, and I will receive and embrace him not only with open arms but also with paternal affection. Do not doubt my faithfulness and integrity towards you. The sweetness of your character, which everyone praises, and the similarity of our religious beliefs, which delight us both, make me love you all the more. I know that you have endured great waves of labor and will also endure the greatest waves and storms of affairs, which almost drown those who seek Christ and not themselves. But I prefer to demonstrate my feelings towards you through actions rather than words. </p>
      <p> I believe you are more promptly informed about the affairs of Piedmont than I am, as you are not so far away. It is said that the French have laid great foundations for victory in Piedmont. In Italy, French affairs have cooled for a few days, especially concerning the Kingdom of Naples; but now everything is said to be heating up and igniting again. </p>
      <p> For the Pope, that incarnate devil, has amassed a huge pile of money through great exactions. Therefore, he does not cease to supply fuel to the fury. The King of England is assembling a large army in the Netherlands; he has come from Hatstet with 12 banners of infantry to the Netherlands, and Pemelberg will soon follow him; the Duke of Brunswick will lead the cavalry there, which is thought to exceed 3000. All of Lower Germany is miserably afflicted by the high cost of provisions, intolerable exactions, domestic soldiers, and the tyranny of the Inquisition. I dare not write anything certain about Hungary. </p>
      <p> It is still unknown what the preachers and several princes will do in Frankfurt. </p>
      <p> Farewell, my Bullinger, and greet Dr. Gesner. Augsburg, June 28, in the year 57. </p>
      <p> Your Geryon. </p>
      <p> To the most learned and pious man, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy Antistes of the Church of Zürich, most esteemed lord and brother. Zürich. </p>
