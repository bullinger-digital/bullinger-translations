      <p>Johannes Blasius wishes grace and longevity of life to his dear Bullinger through the Lord.</p>
      <p>The person you see here in person, most esteemed Bullinger, has been recommended to us by the brothers from Italy, who are more familiar with his life and character. They have urged us to recommend him to you in writing. We considered this unnecessary, since your innate kindness and your well-known readiness to help, especially those who suffer exile for the Lord's cause, are well known to us. However, it was not possible to refuse such a pious and devout request; therefore, we commend him to you. He will explain his business himself. Furthermore, we are certainly curious, as we are continually bothering you, about the status of the Eucharist dispute, not only among the brothers of our Switzerland, but also whether Luther has responded to your most pious response to his absurd faith or confession. We earnestly ask you to inform us of this in your next letters. Farewell through Jesus Christ, who may deign to preserve you for his church for a long time, amen. Hastily, in Chur, on the very day of the Nativity, in the year 1546. To your most honorable wife and your most elegant children, I wish all happiness.</p>
      <p>Your same and most devoted at the Church of St. Regula קהלת.</p>
      <p>To the incomparable man in prudence, piety, and true learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful bishop of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed lord.</p>
