      <p>Greetings. I have nothing of particular importance to write to you at the moment, most esteemed Lord Bullinger. However, so that you do not accuse me of negligence, since I have found a suitable messenger, I am pleased to greet you and all of yours with these words. May you all be well.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I wish to be informed whether you are all truly well and under what auspices our Christopher has come to you and whether he has been restored to his former health. I hope to hear only the best from all of you.</p>
      <p>We are all well here by the grace of God, although I am not free from constant troubles; I am overwhelmed with business, especially legal matters, which compel me to change my way of life considerably. As a result, it follows that I am not able to indulge much in friendships and letters, and therefore I write less frequently to you and other friends; please excuse me for this. We have news that the Venetians are continually anxious that the peace, which has been established among such great monarchs, might bring upon them some notable war, as certain preludes are seen daily indicating the same.</p>
      <p>Recently in Crema, among other things, several Spaniards were discovered plotting some treachery, of whom only one (as it is said) was torn apart by horses, while the rest were taken captive to Venice. Many such things are reported, which I now pass over.</p>
      <p>Cardinal Medici has attained the papacy beyond almost everyone's expectations, and although he is considered to be most fortunate for having achieved such a dignity, I judge that mortals can wish nothing worse for him; for he will be very similar to his predecessors and therefore most impious.</p>
      <p>The Duke of Savoy, governor of Milan, is very ill, not without the danger of losing his life. Eight days ago, Hannibal of Emps went to Rome with a distinguished retinue to visit his uncle, the pope. But also from other places adjacent to my jurisdiction, many are flocking to Rome, thinking that they will all return home wealthy, having been generously rewarded by the pope's liberality. I eagerly await your letters, meanwhile commending myself to you and yours again and again.</p>
      <p>Farewell forever, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, whom I wish to remain safe and happy with your entire family for as long as possible. Written hastily in Chiavenna on the 15th of January, 1560.</p>
      <p>Yours most devotedly, Friedrich von Salis, Commissioner of Chiavenna. To the most honorable and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, supreme preacher of the Church of Zurich and his most esteemed and revered lord. In Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
