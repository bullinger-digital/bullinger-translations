    <p xml:id="regest1">Did not write for the last two masses, as Johannes [Hensenstein] travels less frequently to Frankfurt since his marriage, but recently a messenger from Bautzen is available. For two years, no books [from Zurich] have reached them, but he was able to obtain Zwingli's interpretations of Genesis and Exodus; from the Wittenbergers, only German writings are coming. The Turks have not advanced further - perhaps due to the plague; at a diet in Prague, King Ferdinand was promised help, which will be of little use. The Austrians wish for the Gospel to be preached, as they attribute the lack of success against the Turks to godlessness, but the Bishop of Vienna [Friedrich] Nausea opposed this. Further details in a German letter to Froschauer; greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings and grace through Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>During the last two fairs in Frankfurt, I did not send any letters to the most faithful ministers of the word of God in Zurich, dearest Bullinger.</p>
      <p>This was not due to my negligence or forgetfulness; for I always remember you and truly recognize from your writings that the spirit of Christ dwells in your hearts. I write this with a sincere heart; many faithful brothers feel the same with me. The reason was that young man from Frankfurt, named Johannes; since he married in the Ore Mountains, he rarely visits Frankfurt, although he was born here. I finally found the man in Bautzen, a city a day's journey from this city, who does not neglect the Frankfurt fairs. He voluntarily promised to deliver my letters to Christoph Froschauer, adding that he is familiar with his library. Through his efforts, there will be no room for negligence in the future.</p>
      <p>I, in turn, eagerly await your commentaries. For almost two years, no books have reached us. Many brothers and I with them are surprised. In those days, by the grace of God, I obtained the annotations of the holy man Huldrych Zwingli on Genesis and Exodus, excerpted by Leo Jud and Caspar Megander. The ministers from Wittenberg offer us nothing but German books.</p>
      <p>I would gladly write more; but everything I have in mind is known to you. There is nothing new that could delight you. The Turk reigns widely in Hungary, having become quiet towards our neighbors. He has not yet advanced beyond the borders of Hungary. Perhaps the plague, which had invaded Austria and Moravia, hindered him.</p>
      <p>In the past December, King Ferdinand gathered the Moravians, Silesians, and both Lusatias in Prague; the Austrians were also present. He demanded aid against the Turk. Subsidies were promised, but nothing will be done against the Turk.</p>
      <p>The Austrians especially desire the Gospel to be sincerely preached in their land, asserting that impiety is the reason why nothing has been successfully done against the Turk. The papists opposed, especially a monk named Nausea, who has now become the Bishop of Vienna.</p>
      <p>I will write the rest in German to Christoph Froschauer. I wish for the growth of the knowledge of God in your churches and their ministers. May Pellican, Leo Jud, Megander, Bibliander, and others be safe. At the next fairs, if the grace of Christ is present, I will write more; may it be with us all.</p>
      <p>Very quickly from Zittau in the margraviate of Upper Lusatia, 20th of February, in the year 1542.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted brotherhood</p>
      <p>Oswald Pergener, etc., from the commentaries (City Clerk).</p>
      <p>To the truly pious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed bishop of the Church of Zurich, most sincere friend.</p>
