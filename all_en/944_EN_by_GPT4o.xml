      <p>To the man endowed with the highest piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and teacher, Johannes von Ulm.</p>
      <p>Even though there was absolutely nothing for me to write, most learned and dearest man, I could not let a courier traveling to Switzerland go without giving you at least an empty letter rather than none at all. Truly, there is nothing new in my affairs; we are still engaged in those studies of letters to which you alone of all have always encouraged me.</p>
      <p>About you, although we hear less than we desire, we do hear what we wish: that you adorn and protect Switzerland with such piety and prudence that no enemy, however fierce, dares to invade it. How pleasing this is to me, I think you understand well enough even without me saying it. Indeed, I do what I can and should do in absence, I pray for your safety and wish again and again that I may see you preserved in your former liberty. I cannot describe the religion accepted in England in more detail than in my previous letters to you; for everything is still in a safe and intact state, and none of the faithful even thinks of looking back. We devoutly hope that Ireland and Wales will soon embrace our, or rather, to speak more correctly, Christ's opinion with all their might. Likewise, we confidently trust that Scotland, once it has been completely conquered, will embrace the true and saving doctrine of Christ and will reject darkness with all its heart. About this, I will write to you more certainly when I can. Know that Peter Martyr, a distinguished theologian, is engaged in the same kind of teaching and does not concede anything to the papists, and that he has recently declared his mind more openly concerning the Eucharist and has deviated little, if at all, from you, if I consider the words. But the adversaries; for a certain notable rascal from their number, blathering in a public sermon that the bread is substantively the body of Christ, has torn apart Johannes Oecolampadius, a man endowed with piety and learning, with his unchaste mouth and overwhelmed him with lies, saying that he was so overwhelmed with madness that he attempted to bring death upon himself. O pestiferous, shameless, and bitter tongue, which relies on no other arguments than deceptions and mere tricks! But why bring owls to Athens; for these things are born at home. Take care to be well; for we are as well as we can be and are devoted to our studies. You will convey my greetings to your most honorable wife and to Gwalther, a most learned man and dearest to me, along with others who have deserved well of me, in the most adorned words. Given in Oxford, England, three days before the day of John the Baptist.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your name, Johannes von Ulm. To the man endowed with the highest piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Archbishop of the citizens of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
