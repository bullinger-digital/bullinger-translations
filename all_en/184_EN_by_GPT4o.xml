      <p>Noble, pious, honorable, prudent and wise, gracious, dear sir, my entirely willing service is always ready for your wisdom. Since God, the true and just, has severely punished the imperial cities in body and goods, yet all this is bearable compared to what is happening to them at this time from the priests and from all the priests' protection and support of the emperor and the Roman king, who at this time are imposing on all estates and cities of the empire a form of faith, which is presented and praised by some as a reformation and improvement, but in essence is nothing other than the shameful idolatrous papacy, burdening them to the great torment of their consciences and to the ruin of their souls. The poor people, so faint-hearted, that they would not choose death over such a misleading, miserable life, and therefore everywhere accept the form of the imperial faith, in which they are forced to attend mass, worship the sacrament, keep images, attend vigils and rites for the dead, confess, and other perverted things; for the emperor does not only act with threats but also with the deployment of soldiers. It is known that most of the cities have been forced to accept the aforementioned form of unbelief, only Strasbourg, Constance, Lindau, the Saxon and Sea cities are supposed to remain. Among the princes, only Margrave Hans of Brandenburg, Duke Wolfgang of Zweibrücken, Württemberg, etc., are supposed to remain. The imprisoned Duke of Saxony gave his answer on the evening of Peter and Paul to the two electors of the Palatinate and Margrave Joachim, that he would remain steadfast in his faith and would not accept the imperial form (called the Interim); his life was in the emperor's hands, he entrusted his soul to God, for which he expects great displeasure from the emperor. The people of Nuremberg have answered the emperor, they only ask for another 3 months, in which they may be able to arrange themselves with the Interim, so that no unrest may arise from the common people. With Ulm, it is also not stable. Memmingen, Kempten, Isny, Biberach, and all other similar cities have gone that way; Augsburg accepted it on June 26; this week, however, their cardinal, the bishop, will be installed as of old. Churches are being reconsecrated here and there, and there is great joy and jubilation among priests and monks. In all this, in some places, the church servants are also falling away, especially in the Upper Palatinate; on the other hand, many remain steadfast with God's help, refusing to accept the Interim, leaving what they have, and moving into misery. The emperor has also ordered and commanded the city of Hall in Swabia to arrest their preacher Johannes Brenz and take him to Augsburg, and since the preacher has escaped, he has placed some soldiers in the city for revenge, etc. Thus I have written from Constance. Thus, in recent days, the foremost preacher of Augsburg, Wolfgang Musculus, a remarkably learned man, as he was in the empire, faithful and honest, has come to Zurich. Paulus Raßdorffer, preacher in Memmingen, has also come, and as I am informed, other honorable people are also preparing to move into misery and flee from the abomination, and it is truly a great misery and distress, etc.</p>
      <p>I write all this to your wisdom with entirely good Christian intention as to a lover of evangelical truth, who has also shown himself faithful in protecting and promoting true religion, with an earnest plea, for God's sake, to let this serious matter and the misery and distress of poor exiled people for the sake of truth touch your heart, and to help and advise in the honorable and Christian city of Bern, so that comfort may meet the poor exiles. The praiseworthy city of Bern has many churches, needs many church servants, where they might help the exiled servants of the Lord Christ and the church. I do not intend to accept anyone who is not of our religion and does not beforehand commit to teaching, holding, and preaching according to the general city order and praiseworthy disputation; I have also spoken with Mr. Musculus about this and found him righteous. However, your wisdom knows how to report to Mr. Hans Haller on his behalf. I am very glad that such a pious, remarkably learned man, whom an entire country may rejoice in, has escaped to us in the Confederation from the hands of the Spaniards. He is to be used for profiting, reading, writing in print, disputing, and preaching, as he is proficient in many languages. I ask for God's sake, let him and other poor people be entrusted to your wisdom, to speak the best for them in Bern. May your wisdom also inform me in writing (if possible) what comfort I may give to the miserable and exiled on behalf of you and the praiseworthy city of Bern; for I also assure myself of all comfort and good from my gracious lords of Zurich, that they will gladly do, advise, and help the best according to their ability. I trust in God, He will likewise give it into your heart. Herewith I commend your wisdom along with the praiseworthy city of Bern and all the pious to the protection of God; may He faithfully protect us all in the Confederation from such severe downfall and terrible tyranny.</p>
      <p>Both mayors, Mr. Hab and Mr. Lavater, send their greetings to your wisdom, with whose foreknowledge I have written this letter.</p>
      <p>Dated Zurich, July 9, 1548. Your wisdom's always willing Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Schultheiss Nägeli in Bern regarding the exiles from Swabia due to the Interim.</p>
