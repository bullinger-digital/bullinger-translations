      <p>I have received two letters from your kindness, most illustrious man, which I have taken care to send to the people of Locarno through their own messenger; for I first give thanks to almighty God for your benevolence towards the wretched Christians, your readiness of spirit, and your diligence and solicitude in their cause. May God grant you the crown of justice, just as He has appointed you a valiant soldier and diligent in the business of Christ.</p>
      <p>I therefore ask your kindness and my most noble lords of Zürich not to be upset, even if the matter did not succeed as intended; for it is enough that they have strived with all their might to promote the gospel of Christ. It is now the Lord's to grant the outcome. Just as we do not know what we should ask for, so we know even less what should be done. We humbly pray that they cease to provoke the hornets, lest the word of God be ill-spoken of among the people. It is enough not to have consented to impieties; for it is God's to punish the impious and their impieties. Let them not doubt, the Lord will be with us in time; He alone knows how to rescue His own from temptations and will make a way out along with the temptation. For we ask the clemency of our lords to be inclined to help the needs of the saints, if necessary, so that for the present they may have some places to stay with you or the people of Bern, lest they be forced to wander uncertain of their dwellings. This matter will be explained in person to your senate by the Locarno people's own messenger. It will then be your kindness, as you have been present for them up to this day, to accompany them with your benevolence to the end. Farewell. Chiavenna, December 14, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted servant, Antonio Mario Besozzo.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in piety, learning, and character, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed lord of the people of Zürich.</p>
