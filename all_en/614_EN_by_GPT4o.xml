      <p>Most excellent Bullinger, may the Lord keep you in your ministry without reproach.</p>
      <p>I wrote to you a few days ago about what all the faithful greatly desire to be done by you for the salvation and consolation of the Church of Chiavenna, which has been almost destroyed by many and great discord; namely, that through the Synod of Chur, those two, having been made aware of the cause, be removed: Augustinus, the minister of Chiavenna, and Camillus, the patron of the Anabaptists.</p>
      <p>If you write to the ministers of Chur about this matter, you will do a most pleasing thing not only for me, who holds you in unique esteem, but also for Bishop Vergerio, indeed for all the faithful who are in these parts, and you will most rightly look out for the glory of Christ, which is now in danger in this way. Therefore, you will make an effort so that in this very serious matter we may feel you to be the person we have always considered you to be, that is, the supreme patron and caretaker of the Church of Christ.</p>
      <p>Moreover, I highly commend this brother to you; he is worthy of your effort. He abandoned monasticism along with the mass, and since he could not remain safely in Italy nor seek sustenance elsewhere, he was compelled to come to you, persuaded by us in such a way that either there or in Basel he may be provided for in terms of sustenance and clothing and serve some vocation, provided that he is left with enough leisure to learn something. He is prepared to endure all hardships, however severe, rather than return to that abomination of monks and masses; therefore, it will be your duty to support his commendable endeavor in any way possible. Whatever you do for him, know that you have contributed first to Christ, as you know, then to many faithful and to myself.</p>
      <p>I came to Poschiavo together with Bishop Vergerio. He has everything prepared against the thunderbolts of the Antichrist, which he is about to hurl against that beast. He says he will winter here to complete his work.</p>
      <p>As for me, this too insolent persecution of the Venetians offers almost no hope. Those letters of recommendation will be of no use.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord. Greet the rest of the church in my name and love me.</p>
      <p>Given at Poschiavo, on the 3rd of August, 1549. Yours sincerely, Baldassare Altieri.</p>
      <p>To the most upright and learned minister of the Church of Zürich, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my ever-honored.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
