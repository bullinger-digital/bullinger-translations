    <p xml:id="regest1">M端nster was stormed, but not conquered. The city is to be starved out with a blockade. In Cologne, there is concern about newly emerging sects, which is why they are temporarily sticking to the old church customs. The better preaching of the Gospel bears little fruit. Bitter thanks for Bullinger's "De testamento" and the commentary on 1 Corinthians, as well as for a cheese. He defends himself against the accusation of laziness in writing. Greetings. Teachers enjoy little respect in Cologne.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace.</p>
      <p>Regarding the siege of the city of M端nster, I have recently reported. Know that the city was stormed in six places, yet not conquered, and about two thousand of them perished before the city and many were wounded. Now the bishop has begun to build six blockhouses on the common roads. He intends to garrison them with soldiers, with the aim of preventing anything from being brought to the people of M端nster, and thus to starve them out over time. How the situation will develop, I may learn with time, etc.</p>
      <p>Our lords in Cologne are not a little concerned and worried about the various sects that arise here and there, each one stranger than the other. They do their utmost to ensure that nothing new is introduced in their city, and for the time being, they adhere completely to the old ceremonies. However, the Gospel is preached more purely than before, with little effect; few pay attention to it, etc.</p>
      <p>I have received the "Exposition of the Covenants" and the "Commentary on the First Epistle to the Corinthians" and the piece of cheese. They are all welcome to me, and I thank you a thousand times. However, that you think I should be more inclined to write because of the sending of cheese than paper gifts, you do me wrong. I have sent up three letters within a year, one by the bishop's messenger from Costens, the other by a citizen of Cologne, the third just recently, in which I have listed what gifts I have received from you. I have not seen the "Compendium Vadiani in Acta Apostolorum." If I knew how to do you a favor, I would not fail to do so. I would load Brother Jacob with a Dutch cheese; he would not carry it. If there is anything with us that pleases you or your wife, command me. And with this, I commend you to the Almighty. Greet your brother and wife for me very much.</p>
      <p>Also, the teaching is of no use in Cologne; it is of no regard. The people do not know which way they want to go. They do not raise their children to good things. As a result, I and my kind are held in little regard and must seek all sorts of things to sustain ourselves.</p>
      <p>Given on the last day of September in the year 1534.</p>
      <p>Dietrich Bitter von Wipperf端rth.</p>
      <p>To the honorable and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, my kind and good friend, to be delivered. In Zurich.</p>
