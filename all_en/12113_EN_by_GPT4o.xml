      <p>Greetings. I am sending Osiander's response to that infamous poem with which he was provoked. Now the pot has a lid. And once again, we have been given a just cause for complaint, so that no studies can be peaceful or complete for us, while in the meantime, the Roman Pope rejoices and sings under his cloak with confidence in our discord. Meanwhile, Frecht wrote to me about various matters, including one main point: the remarkable inclination of the cities towards our safety. I wrote to him, expressing my concern about some reluctance from the Roman Emperor, fearing heavy conflicts and that we are excellently preparing ourselves in a confederation to maintain our freedoms and liberties and to bind the guard to it; for it is well to consider that if we were defeated, it would also affect other free states, etc. To this, he replied orally: although the rabble along with some priests might wish or want it, they should not think that the cities and states would allow themselves to be brought into such danger as to wage war against the Confederation. More Swiss would be made before more Swiss would be tamed. These were his words. But what he seeks, you will understand from the letters themselves, from which it is easy to recognize the attitude of the cities towards us. I will send you Stumpf's Chronicle, which I like very much, within the next 8 days by the next post. As for the monastery, the city of St. Gallen, Appenzell, and the region of the Gotteshausbund, we want (and are now working on) to improve them in such a way that Mr. Johannes Stumpf will accept it with special thanks. However, everything should be done neither enviously nor with any offense or fault, but calmly, candidly, freely, truly, and simply. Farewell. Very quickly, as the messenger is knocking and calling me to the council. January 15, 1545. Return Frecht's letters.</p>
      <p>Your Vadianus.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord and friend.</p>
