      <p>Greetings. What has been the growth of the French churches since a year ago, and how happily we have begun to breathe under our ruler, whom we hope to be another Josiah, you have long been able to know, dearest brothers in the Lord. It is not at all surprising that Satan envied this progress and therefore now stirred up the depths of Acheron through the work of his faithful ministers. However, it is worth the effort for you to know the whole matter.</p>
      <p>In the very colloquy at Poissy (which was disrupted mainly by the cardinal of Lorraine not so much by cunning as by shameless audacity), the enemies of truth, otherwise most hostile to each other, began to be united in the example of Herod and Pilate and to deliberate about crucifying Christ. And when they saw that the authority of the pious nobles in the court was greater than to immediately obtain this, they resorted to their own arts. Thus, some went towards Lorraine, intending to draw the Germans to their side by presenting the Augsburg Confession as a mask (while they themselves care for nothing less than religion) or to engage them against us; others at home and in the very heart of the kingdom, especially in Paris, began to gather money, friends, and forces in every way possible; for there is no doubt that they have joined with all the others. It was not difficult to perceive all these things and indeed to discover them by many indications, but to guard against them was not the same, since those whose interest it particularly was (as you know, the children of this world are wiser than the children of light) could never be brought to apply the diligence needed in recognizing doubtful matters.</p>
      <p>Therefore, after the edict was promulgated, by which some sort of liberty was granted to us, they thought they would be safe. Then this inconvenience also arose, that he, by whose authority the others necessarily relied, fascinated by the deceptions of the enemies, after long dissimulation, suddenly went over to their camp and was not content with having done this until he expelled the pious nobles from the court. Then followed the illness of Prince Condé, who himself, wishing to retire home for a time, suddenly the whole conspiracy was revealed.</p>
      <p>For Guise, summoned to the court as if bringing death and destruction with him, first attacked the church at Vassy. Now Vassy is a small town not far from Joinville, the homeland of the Guises, long famous in those regions for its piety and therefore hated by the Guises. Here, therefore, their first attack was poured out with such rage that hardly any example of similar cruelty has ever been recorded, as you will learn from the true history of the event.</p>
      <p>The messenger of this cruelty, with added threats that breathed nothing but similar savagery, inflated the spirits of the enemies and also awakened ours to think of a remedy. Therefore, the neighboring nobles were summoned, and by chance, Condé was in the city, hurrying home with his pregnant wife, who, having tried everything in vain to persuade Guise to go to the court by another route unarmed, was finally brought to the point that on the same day and moment that he entered the city armed, he also, with a suddenly gathered company of about three hundred nobles, proceeded to the assembly armed.</p>
      <p>From that day, everything in the city was more like a camp than a city. Finally, Navarre came, who, by the queen's order, commanded both sides to lay down their arms.</p>
      <p>Where these things were tending, there was no one here who did not know. For certain reasons, Condé did not like to wait for this order, so we left the city for a day's journey. There, Admiral joined us.</p>
      <p>Soon other forces also joined, while we waited for Guise to depart as well.</p>
      <p>And he did depart, but armed, directly to the king and queen, against their command. And indeed, a garrison was established in the city under the name of the governor, Cardinal Bourbon. It was not difficult to foresee that Guise would do this (which was of the greatest importance), nor to guard against it, since we were in no way inferior, but I dare say something fateful happened here, the outcome of which I am still waiting for. Having received the news of the captive king (for it is nothing other than the most miserable captivity, which even the king testified with tears), we returned towards the city to cross the Seine, at the town called Pont de Saint-Cloud, we caused great alarm in the city, since we had about two thousand horsemen in arms, and it did not seem difficult to occupy the alarmed city. But the leaders had another plan.</p>
      <p>For from the bridge of Saint-Cloud, we suddenly reached Orléans by the greatest marches, so opportunely indeed that, with the enemy garrison not yet having entered, we were admitted by the brothers without slaughter and any tumult, not without great rejoicing and the most glorious jubilation of psalms: where we also now remain and gather forces of horsemen and foot soldiers from every side. Meanwhile, the enemies had nothing more important than to scatter the Parisian church, trampling on the royal edicts. Where no day passes without the furious populace exercising unheard-of examples of savagery, led especially by the most impure Constable. The remaining conspirators, to persuade everyone that the king is not captive, carry him around with his mother and brother and display him everywhere.</p>
      <p>And so the wretched princes are compelled to dissemble this evil with themselves and even to subscribe to the most savage proscription of our people. This, therefore, is now the condition of us all.</p>
      <p>What the outcome will be, He knows whose cause we defend together with public liberty and the safety of the kingdom. However, since we have learned from some that those have been sent there who spread the most vain lies and gather soldiers against us, we did not want to fail our just cause and duty. Therefore, we implore you in the name of the Lord, to have faith in us, about whom you cannot justly doubt, rather than in the slanders of those. Nor is there any reason for you to be moved by the name or seal of the king and queen.</p>
      <p>For what will they not extort from a captive boy and a woman mother? But the Lord lives, the avenger of our innocence. What we ask, you will understand from him who is setting out to you for this very reason. If there is any compassion, brothers, help the infinite multitude of brothers in whatever ways you can, and prevent the way to you from being opened to the most cruel robbers through our ruin.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most esteemed brothers, and continually intercede for us with the most merciful Father. Orléans, April 12, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Theodore Beza.</p>
      <p>I had omitted an unworthy deed.</p>
      <p>The wife of Prince Condé, pregnant, while returning to her own after her husband had set out, behold, a band of peasants attacked the prince's son, about nine years old, sitting on a horse with stones, and wounded two of his retinue. The mother was so struck by the danger to her son that on that very day she gave birth prematurely to twins; however, both live, and the mother is quite well. But from this, you can infer how far the rage of the enemies has progressed and how necessary it is to check it, since we rely on the expressed royal edicts.</p>
