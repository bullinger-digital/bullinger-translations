    <p xml:id="regest1">Could not respond immediately due to many obligations, but takes advantage of the departure of the Zurich envoys [Hans Rudolf Lavater and Rudolf Kambli] to King Ferdinand I to write. Thanks for the friendship and is pleased if his [Bible] commentaries are appreciated. Regrets that the controversy over the Lord's Supper is being conducted so hostilely, but expects improvement - after Luther's friendly letter to the Swiss [from December 1, 1537]; counts on Osiander's and others' understanding and help. What he wrote about the Lord's Supper in his work dedicated to King Henry VIII of England [„De scripturae sanctae authoritate... libri duo“] will not be condemned by Osiander if he approves of his commentaries on Paul and Melanchthon's new edition of the „Loci“. Zwingli neither saw mere symbols in the bread and wine of the Lord's Supper, nor did he deny the presence of Christ; he only rejected the crude notion of physical presence. There have been enough disputes; they should be laid to rest through mutual forgiveness of errors and insults. Osiander's booklet on papal oaths was useful to Bullinger in the composition of his work. Thanks for the kindness shown to the person he recommended. Recommends the Zurich envoys and asks to support them with the Nuremberg Council if necessary. Greetings from [Joachim] Vadian and [Konrad] Pellikan.</p>

      <p>To the most excellent man, Lord Andreas Osiander, Bishop of Nuremberg, faithful minister of Christ and an uncommon friend.</p>
      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. Know, most learned Osiander, that the duty of writing between us, which has been mutually interrupted until now, was not due to any ill will but out of necessity. For I am so entangled in affairs, both private and public, that I lacked both the time and leisure to respond to you and write to other friends, despite my great desire to do so. Meanwhile, when our most illustrious council decided to send these envoys to King Ferdinand and they affirmed they would pass through Nuremberg, I did not think such an opportunity should be negligently overlooked. Therefore, first of all, I give you many thanks for so readily accepting me into the circle of your friends. I hope that you will never regret the pledged faith and friendship. Secondly, I thank God the Father through our Lord Jesus Christ, who has deemed it worthy to use my ministry and my vigils for the glory of His name. I did not seek any private glory with those commentaries of mine. I wished to benefit many and, as much as I could, to promote the glory of God. I prayed to the Lord in this name, that He might bless my undertaking. If, therefore, my work is now approved by you, most learned man, and by other good men, I acknowledge that my prayers have been heard by the Lord, I acknowledge the benefit of God. To Him alone I attribute whatever I can and have. What remains, I will pray for His mercy, that He may always use my ministry for the glory of His name and the benefit of the church, and that He may increase His gifts in me and grant modesty and constancy in all His works.</p>
      <p>As for the controversy over the words of the Supper, believe me, I grieve that the matter of the symbol of concord and peace has come to such a hostile conflict; I grieve that men, foremost in the restoration of religion and adorned with rare gifts, have so given themselves over to passions, anger, hatred, grief, and other disturbances of the mind; I grieve that such a pleasant spectacle has been offered to our enemies; I grieve that the church is so filled with contentions and factions that modesty and brotherly love scarcely have a place; I grieve that many are still held in foul errors and papal abominations by the same offense. May God have mercy on us, illuminate His face upon us, and bless us. You indeed, I hope, say most rightly and prudently that the contention, mitigated by time, will soon be entirely removed. I also hope the same, especially since the most illustrious man, Doctor Martin Luther, has written so amicably to the Swiss churches. Certainly, the fire was so great, the injuries so great, and such wounds were inflicted on both sides, that this contrition cannot be mitigated and healed among many except by time. Meanwhile, the main thing that will contribute to reconciliation is if you and men like you, learned and foremost, do not abandon our churches, if you love the ministers as fellow soldiers and dearest brothers, and sometimes greet them with friendly letters, and again if we and ours do not despise your churches and pursue you with mutual love, excluding informers and sinister rumors on both sides. There is no reason for you to doubt my faith and zeal towards good men who have deserved well of piety and letters. Last winter I wrote and published two books to the King of England about the Word of God and its ministers against common enemies, the pseudo-bishops of the papacy, in which I touched briefly on the sacramental matter, but in such a way, I think, that it cannot displease you and all the pious. For if you consult my writings on Paul more fairly, if you do not disapprove of what Philipp Melanchthon wrote in the latest edition of the "Loci," you will not condemn our present work to the king. Believe me, most esteemed Osiander, our Zwingli did not at all feel that nothing is received by the faithful in the Supper except bare symbols of bread and wine, nor did he simply deny the presence of Christ the Lord in the Supper, but only the gross and corporeal one. Meanwhile, he acknowledged from the heart what is true and most salutary for the soul. However, those who have entered the arena and are now striking and fighting have little moderation, nor do they consider those things which the spectators of the fight otherwise clearly see. Therefore, those who know how to judge about the contest and the gladiators more rightly than these. But let there be enough of raging and sinning so far, let us take care, my most beloved Osiander, that our churches may flourish in purity, truth, and holy peace. Let us pray for each other, forgiving each other's errors and injuries.</p>
      <p>Your booklet on papal oaths was of great use to me - as you will find in the second book to the King of England. For this, I thank you, as well as for the kindness and humanity shown to the one I recommended to you. Now I commend to you these envoys of our city, certainly most religious and honest men. Help them, wherever the need arises, with the illustrious council of your city. Farewell, my dearest Osiander, together with your wife and children, and the other ministers of Christ. From Zurich in the month of March 1538. Our Vadianus, Pellikan, and the rest of our fellow soldiers wish you well.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger</p>
