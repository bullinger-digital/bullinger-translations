      <p>God has now sent me the opportunity I greatly desired through this messenger, so that I can write to you, dearest Bullinger. I last wrote from Strasbourg, where I saw your Heinrich, that is, yourself, as I wrote, and indeed you acted wisely in sending him away from you for a while. I wish you would do the same for me someday. By God's kindness, I am well and continue to roll the same stone, that is, I live in those perpetual labors to which I am now accustomed. I spent a full 20 days preparing memoranda, with which Mr. Sleidanus may enrich and adorn his history (as I hope), and tomorrow I will send them to Strasbourg. It has been almost two months since I last saw the Duke; but next week I am setting out to see him and will stay there for 10 whole days; there are many things that draw me there, and all good things (thanks be to God). Here everything is peaceful, both in the school and throughout the duchy, indeed even in Germany itself, whatever may be happening in Flanders or England. However, there is something new in the school, as our Molinaeus daily loses some of his reputation, and (in my opinion) will lose whatever little remains. I love the man and support him as much as I can; but he can destroy more than all his friends can build. Now he is suffering from this frenzy; for he says that the King of France will soon be the Pope's enemy and will recall him with all the exiles to sharpen their pens against the Pope. Deluded by this most vain hope, he openly says he will leave here within 15 days. Meanwhile, he consumes food here and there, certainly changing tables three times in ten days, and now he is with Volmar. Eventually, he will collapse; he sins against nature and cannot be sustained in any way. But all these things, which are otherwise better known here, are with you. Whatever others may hope, I announce that the assembly will finally be held at Michaelmas. I had written to a friend to deposit about 50 crowns with you, if he does, you will keep them and inform me that they have been deposited. I tell Josias that I have moved from the previous narrower house into the one where Ehemus lived; therefore, if you are to seek the Ferinae Thermae (Baden), which I greatly desire, let him know where to lead you directly; I speak from the heart, my dearest Bullinger: I now live splendidly, so that I pay 30 for the annual rent, always to the glory of God. I now have with me Hieronymus Donzelinus, a physician most learned in Latin and Greek, driven into exile from Venice for the sake of the gospel.</p>
      <p>Ulrich Fugger, who was the son of Raimund, will soon take him in for my sake. I wrote about the Genoese thief; this is how it was: he came recommended by Gribaldi's letters, so I could not help but bring him with me from Raetia; finally, he behaved most disgracefully and more than can be expressed in words; for having partly broken open chests and partly opened them with forged keys (which we found), and having broken open Donzelinus's packages, he stole away with many things. But we recovered almost everything; for he came under suspicion in Balingen, so that he fled from there after being released for theft. But listen further: he had gathered whatever he could of my writings and others' against the antichrist and had taken them away; I think he wanted to boast to that devil that, since he could not kill me, he at least took away my writings.</p>
      <p>Truly he had come here to take me, not my writings; but the Lord saved and will continue to save, and I will be more diligent in guarding against this kind of thing.</p>
      <p>Give my greetings to Josias, my Lavater, and Zwingli, indeed to the whole house, school, and church, as I say alone. Pray for me. TÃ¼bingen, August 19, 1554.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>To you, Bullinger. Second.</p>
