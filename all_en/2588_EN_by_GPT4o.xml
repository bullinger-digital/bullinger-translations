      <p>Praise be to God always, on the 14th of March 1555 in Ferrara.</p>
      <p>My very friendly greetings and always my humble service are also ready from me, honorable, kind, dear lord and brother in Christ Jesus, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>For a long time, I have not written nor have I heard of your well-being, and if it is well with you, it would be a joy to me; I hope to God that you are well. I hope to hear something similar from you. Now, my lord and countryman, since I have such a messenger at the moment, I could not refrain from informing you of my well-being and health, praise be to God, and thanks to Him eternally. Amen. The bearer of this is a citizen of Ferrara, named Hans del Segrado, a very young pious butcher and a well-traveled fellow, and he intends to travel through France to Spain and to England and the Netherlands and back through Germany to see the countries; it is my friendly request to you, that you would be a good person to him and show him something in the honorable city of Zurich, so that he may also speak well of our nation.</p>
      <p>For indeed, whoever passes through Zurich speaks praise and honor of you; three of the young prince of Ferrara's people have told me this and all good and honorable things that have been shown to them. In this, you would do me a service, and with whatever I can serve you, just command and request always; you will find me willing, and furthermore, I ask you to greet for me Mr. Ammann Vogler and Konrad Gesler and Master Hans Fries and Mr. Heinrich Goldli and his wife. With that, may the dear God be with you and us all. Made in haste. The brothers are 2. Your always willing servant Hans Ratgeb.</p>
