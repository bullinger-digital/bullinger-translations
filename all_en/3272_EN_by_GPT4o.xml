      <p>Greetings. Why I am not doing now what should have been done long ago, my father, I wish I did not have such a suitable reason. But praise be to God, who is accustomed to instruct His own in this way, not to destroy them.</p>
      <p>I am surprised that I have understood absolutely nothing yet about the four copies of the Bible, which I sent long ago to Mr. Zwingli, as I had promised.</p>
      <p>You have the remaining part of Mr. Calvin's last response, a man indeed worthy even for the holy labor, whom the neighbors desire to destroy more than Satan himself, along with so many thousands of exiles. I cannot write more due to sadness and illness.</p>
      <p>I commend to you both my health and that of my wife. This is written with difficulty by my hand. August 18th.</p>
      <p>Yours, Beza.</p>
      <p>I include the other brothers and fellow ministers together.</p>
      <p>To the excellent servant of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my father to be especially revered.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
