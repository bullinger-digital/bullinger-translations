    <p xml:id="regest1">[Martin] Bucer traveled one and a half months ago to the [Arch-]Bishop and Elector of Cologne [Hermann von Wied], who has been inclined towards the evangelical doctrine for some time - hopefully, this does not result in an impure mixture. According to a report from Hans von Utenheim, who returned to Basel, the city of Metz and its entire surrounding area have embraced the Gospel; the same was written by the Frankfurt preacher [Mathias] Limberger [probably to Johannes Gast] about a large city to which he was called, although [Oswald] Myconius did not mention its name [cf. No. 1606]. A rumor suggests that the Bavarian dukes want to approach the Schmalkaldic League. There is no progress to report from Speyer; it is said that [King] Ferdinand is uncertain whether to await the arrival of the other princes and the end of the Diet or to return to Bohemia, where an uprising is said to have arisen; however, there seems to be little truth to this. A delegation from Pope [Paul III.] is said to be on its way to France to persuade King [Francis I.] to marry his daughter [Marguerite] to [Emperor] Charles [V.]; the Pope wishes to suppress Lutheranism with the help of the two rulers and through the Council of Trent. Rumor has it that the Pope has taken Siena by force; Bullinger believes the popes, kings, and princes are incarnate devils. He awaits the promised reply from Vadian [Manuscript to BZD C 315] on [Kaspar] Schwenckfeld's doctrine as well as news about the situation in Hungary. Emperor [Charles V.] is arming again against Algiers. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord. I have nothing to write to you, my most esteemed Vadian, except that Bucer went to the Archbishop of Cologne, who is an Elector of the Holy Roman Empire, one and a half months ago. The Archbishop has been contemplating and laboring over something evangelical for some time now, so we must rightly pray to the Lord that it does not result in an unfortunate outcome or, as many often do, produce something monstrous, with the purity of the word being mixed with Pharisaic and papistic leaven. Furthermore, the noble Johannes Utenheim, returning to Basel, reported that Metz and its entire region have embraced the Gospel. Limberger, the preacher from Frankfurt, writes that a large city, whose name Myconius did not mention to me, has also embraced the Gospel, and he has been called there to educate them. There is a rumor that the Bavarian dukes are seeking to join the Schmalkaldic League. In Speyer, nothing serious has begun in the past few days. Perhaps they think that the Turk will delay longer. They say that Ferdinand is uncertain whether to await the arrival of other princes and the end of the Diet or to return to Bohemia, where they suspect some kind of uprising has arisen. This is indicated obscurely; perhaps because it has little or no truth. The Pope is said to have sent a delegation to the French king to persuade him to marry his daughter to Charles; if a prince is born from this union, he is already declared to be the future Duke of Milan. But some suspect that the French king will not wait until this wicked master of delays has interposed enough obstacles; for the Pope is wonderfully eager to unite the minds of kings, whose help he will then use against the Germans and summon the Council of Trent, in which the Lutheran heresy will be suppressed. There is a rumor that the Pope has taken Siena by force and holds it not without bloodshed. I believe nothing else than that the popes, kings, and princes are incarnate devils. I have nothing more at the moment. I am expecting the questions opposed to the Schwenckfeldians, which you recently promised. I am also expecting what certain news you have about the affairs in Hungary. The Emperor is preparing for a journey and equipping himself with new troops and a new fleet to return to Algiers and come back more calamitous. Farewell, most esteemed Vadian. March 2, 1542. Your Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Joachim Vadian, his venerable and more than dear brother and lord.</p>
