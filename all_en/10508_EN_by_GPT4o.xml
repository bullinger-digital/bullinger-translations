    <p xml:id="regest1">Asks Bullinger to listen to and advise Michael Farner, who is currently deeply distressed and confused due to church problems. Does not know how things will proceed with the church in Trüllikon, but could in no way leave his own congregation to serve there. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace, peace, and constancy through Christ.</p>
      <p>I beseech you, my dearest Bullinger, by Christ the Lord, to receive with a kind countenance and to listen with a pious spirit to that excellent and most beloved man to me, Michael, who is now more than sufficiently afflicted, disturbed, and distracted by the matters of the church. You will hear amazing things. Help and advise. And so much for this.</p>
      <p>As for how the affairs of the church in Trüllikon are now navigating, I do not know. I wish to be informed. Indeed, it is not without reason, since I have no one who would take care of my matters there if I were called. I cannot and should not abandon this church. Meanwhile, the burden of my duty presses upon me. What I wish, you understand. Meanwhile, fare well in the Lord Jesus Christ, to whom I commend you along with your church, your most honorable household, and your dearest brothers.</p>
      <p>In haste, Stammheim, November 9, 1534.</p>
      <p>Lorenz Meyer.</p>
      <p>To the Christian man and evangelical doctor H. Bullinger, brother to be respected in the Lord.</p>
