      <p>Greetings. We have been expecting your letters for fourteen whole days.</p>
      <p>We have little or nothing to report that you, reverend father, would wish to know. I met the distinguished man Hercules von Salis (who also encouraged me to convey his greetings to you in his own words); but he denies knowing what the Venetians are planning; he says they are vigilant and preparing for any event. Those who come from our people in Venice speak wonderfully of the Venetians' kindness towards them; for many from the Rhaetians are accustomed to travel there for trade. The people of Venetian dominion are convinced that there is some sort of alliance between their lords and ours, and I hear that the Venetian senate is quite kindly indulging this belief. Hercules affirms that the Bishop of Constance presides over the Council of Trent in the name of the Pope; there are those who claim that he has never in his life looked into the Bible. Paulus Gadius writes that it is certain the fathers of Trent are now thinking of beginning their most serious sessions; but in Italy, nothing is currently being done regarding military matters. Theodoric, the bailiff of Schwyz, is said to have returned home.</p>
      <p>You must absolutely ensure that the people of Glarus obtain their rights, that is, that a decision is finally made; for I do not wish to hear what I hear everywhere; the name of Zurich, which has been famous among all until now, is beginning to be gradually obscured. I write this not without immense sorrow, and if you heard a tenth of what is daily murmured into my ears, you would say I have just causes for sorrow, I am sure. The Elector Palatine and Wolfgang (if I am not mistaken, his brother) Palatine, the Duke of WÃ¼rttemberg, and the Margrave of Baden write to our people. The main point of the letter is this: they have heard that the Pope and his followers have requested passage or may request it in the future; they urge our people not to trust sweet words; rather, they should cultivate friendship and neighborliness with the German princes. If they do this (as they have done so far), they too will act as friends, etc.</p>
      <p>This is the main point.</p>
      <p>I hear our people will respond.</p>
      <p>This is mostly what I wanted you to know.</p>
      <p>Friedrich von Salis is here with us and has promised to write himself.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ.</p>
      <p>Chur, February 2, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man of singular learning, piety, and humanity, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, his lord and patron.</p>
