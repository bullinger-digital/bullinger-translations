      <p>Greetings. I have finally completed the books I wrote against the Anabaptists, and for which reason I have sent you letters less frequently for quite some time now. I am now sending the book itself and thus try to make amends for what you might have complained was lacking in my diligence. I overwhelm you with my writings; however, I do not think you need them, but since I usually send my works to my closest friends, and you are among the first and oldest friends, I cannot help but share mine with you. Please consider it kindly, I pray.</p>
      <p>You would do a most welcome thing if you would kindly inform me what seems to you more correct or more convenient or even should be proposed differently. Indeed, I have compiled many things in this work in a short time; I pray to the Lord that all these things may contribute to His glory and the salvation of many. From France, we hear of strange disturbances arising.</p>
      <p>There are among the princes and nobles those who wish to free the king from the rule and tyranny of the cardinal and the Guise family; the French do not like that the Lorrainers sit on their heads. The constable has long since left the court; the King of Navarre is also scorned; other princes are forced to see what they do not want: therefore, friends now write that I do not know what the French princes and nobles are planning, from which a remarkable change must necessarily arise, etc. Let us pray to the Lord that things turn out well.</p>
      <p>It is strange why so many companies of soldiers are being gathered throughout Germany, if what I hear is true. If you have any information, please share it.</p>
      <p>Master Burcher has not yet returned, perhaps he will return with the merchants coming back from Frankfurt. All of mine greet you; greet your family.</p>
      <p>Wilhelm Stucki has gone to Master Hubert, so that he may be a companion to your son.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 29, 1560.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
