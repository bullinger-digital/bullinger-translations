    <p xml:id="regest1">The Englishman [John] Burcher wrote yesterday that he [in Zurich] has married [Adelheit Kn√ºpli?] and is seeking [Zurich] citizenship, for which he needs a certificate of good conduct that Myconius is to issue and send to Bullinger. - Myconius thus attests to Burcher's impeccable conduct during the time Burcher lived with him. His diligence and reliability in literary work were confirmed by the printers [Johannes Oporinus and Michael Isengrin]. His interest in religious matters, shown during table conversations, is likely the reason for his expulsion from his homeland. Should Bullinger be able to assist Burcher in this matter, he is encouraged to do so. - Myconius is expecting [letters] from Pope [Paul III], which he will soon send to Bullinger. - Greetings to Theodor [Bibliander] and [Konrad] Pellikan.</p>

      <p>John Burcher, the Englishman, wrote yesterday that he has married [in Zurich] and desires your citizenship. Since this is granted only to those of good repute, he asked me to write a testimony of his life while he was with me, for you to pursue the rest.</p>
      <p>I say therefore before the Lord, that during the time I have known him, not only while he was in my house, he has conducted himself in such a way that there was nothing I could reproach him for. In literary labors, he was diligent and faithful, as the printers testified. At the table, his conversation was always about divine matters, for which he was expelled from his homeland and is now completely excluded. His life was plainly blameless, so that I often wondered how it could be that I never heard any stain attached to him. Therefore, I am in this, that I can commend him as a good citizen and, as you know, for future benefit. If you can be of any help in this matter, I ask you to assist; for I have no doubt that you will not bestow a benefit on an ungrateful person. Therefore, consider him highly recommended for being good and pious.</p>
      <p>I am also expecting some things from the Roman pontiff, which I will send shortly.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with all the pious brothers, especially Theodor [Bibliander] and [Konrad] Pellikan. From Basel, hastily, just about to ascend the pulpit, January 27, 1545. Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To D. Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned Antistes of Zurich, friend and brother in the Lord.</p>
