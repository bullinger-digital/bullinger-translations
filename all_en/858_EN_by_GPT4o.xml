      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Jesus Christ. Amen. We cannot, brother and esteemed lord in Christ, refrain from troubling and interrupting your and your fellow workers' studies and affairs, not so much because we have experienced your humanity and singular benevolence towards us, but because we are aware of your unique vigilance towards all the churches of Christ, and your tireless effort to consult with everyone, especially those of the same profession. Therefore, when our senate, together with the people, decided to summon us, they proposed to us these articles, which we now send to you, through three elected from the senatorial order and three from the people, asking that you provide us with your assistance in this matter. For we do not wish to act in such an arduous matter without forethought and rashly, lest we regret our decision or there be those who can reproach us for having concluded this tragedy without consulting the Corinthians. We know that in a similar matter we have used both your work and counsel and have stood by them, and we have not regretted it to this day. Therefore, most humane brothers, assist us, so that we do nothing that could tarnish the glory of our common Lord, but that all things may be directed to the glory of Christ and the salvation of His church. We would rather change our course than do anything that would disgrace our profession. We do not doubt that our Savior will provide both food and clothing for us and our children, either with you or with other churches. What remains to be said, you will receive in person through our most faithful brother. For it seemed right to him to offer his assistance in this matter, so that everything might be more surely expedited. Our brothers greet you; they also greet, in the name of all of us, Mr. Theodor, Pellican, and Gwalther. Hastily from Schaffhausen, March 12, 1550.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the man distinguished in piety and doctrine, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church.</p>
