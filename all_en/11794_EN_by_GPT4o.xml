    <p xml:id="regest1">Sends a part of a writing by Bucer ["What is taught and preached in the name of the holy gospel... in Bonn..."], which Bullinger should send back, the second part will follow; one should be satisfied with Bucer's teaching, considering the situation he is in [in the Archbishopric of Cologne], even if he could have expressed some things more clearly, as he himself would admit. Request for divine assistance; greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Since I did not receive the messenger I expected on May 24th, I am sending a part of the booklet that Bucer published, which I have been able to read these past days. I will send the latter part, which exceeds this by three gatherings, once I have read it, and you have returned this part, which no one else has read. There is no other copy here, and even in Strasbourg, there is only one remaining. I believe that those of good will, considering Bucer's teaching, especially when they carefully consider the context and those with whom he is currently dealing, will appreciate it; for otherwise, some things, as even Bucer would not deny, could have been presented more clearly and solidly. I can only conjecture about myself, what I would do if I were there.</p>
      <p>May the Lord extend the boundaries of His kingdom more and more through our ministry! In this, my venerable and excellent brother, fare well and perpetually. Greet the brothers and friends, especially our Gwalther. May 30, 1543.</p>
      <p>Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a friend to be greatly respected and a brother most dear. In Zurich.</p>
