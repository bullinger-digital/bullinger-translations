      <p>Greetings. Since your most honorable council has achieved nothing with its authority, favor, and requests among the neighbors, a meeting will be held in Baden. However, because no response is usually given there unless the delegates of the cities and cantons come prepared, your most honorable council is again requested to ensure that the demands, which our delegates will bring, are communicated to the confederates. If you can extract anything that would be of interest to us, I ask you not to hesitate to inform me privately. However, although it is necessary to also make the matter known to the neighbors, so that they do not complain of being kept in the dark, and indeed so that they do not dismiss our people empty-handed under this pretext, we nevertheless wish them to learn of it a little later, so that they do not block the way. Since, due to the inclement weather, it is not yet convenient to travel for leisure, at least make an effort to see us here immediately after Easter. I defer to that time the consultation that you wrote should be held regarding the letters of Mr. a Lasco. Farewell, most illustrious man and my especially honored brother, along with Mr. Martyr, Mr. Gualther, your family, and other colleagues. May the Lord bless you more and more always!</p>
      <p>Geneva, March 17, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your John Calvin.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man and distinguished minister of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, faithful pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, most esteemed brother and colleague.</p>
