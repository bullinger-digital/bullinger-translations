    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius will report on the progress [of the discussions about the First Helvetic Confession]. Gryn√§us has recommended Bullinger to the [Archbishop] of Canterbury [Thomas Cranmer] at his request; [Christoph] Froschauer, to whom he wanted to show the letter, does not understand Latin. The basis of a concord can only be the truth; although the confession [of the Swiss] agrees with it, there is little hope for agreement. He requests Bullinger's intercession for his newly begun theological teaching activity. Greetings. Thanks for a book [HBBibl I 81].</p>

      <p>Greetings. Myconius will respond to the rest, what and how everything has been done.</p>
      <p>I wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury as you wished, diligently; but you are mistaken in believing that I can gain any favor for your name. However, whatever it is, I did it diligently. I wanted Froschauer to read the letters of recommendation, but I did not know he does not understand Latin.</p>
      <p>Regarding this concord, I cannot sufficiently conjecture what will happen. The Lord himself governs the matter; this I see. As for the rest, I do not see what is being done. Therefore, let us call upon him with all our heart. May truth live and prevail! If it can be borne, nothing will be more important than concord with those who conspire with us in truth; if not, let the Lord's will be done. My conscience is a sufficient witness to me that I do not abhor the friendship of those who labor in the Lord's work. But if a heathen says that truth is more important than a friend like Plato, how much more should we! I know that this confession of ours is neither abhorrent to truth nor to Christian concord. For what, have we not stammered with them, have we not done everything? I write this because I seem to almost smell that there is no hope of concord from Luther. Therefore, let the Lord's will be done, as I said. But I discuss these things with you alone and before the Lord. For what purpose would it serve to say these things to those ignorant of the matters?</p>
      <p>You will pray, my most candid soul, diligently for your brother. For I have undertaken to lecture in sacred matters, where incredible difficulty surrounds me. But he who impels me here will give me knowledge of his will.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my sweetest heart in the Lord. Greet your wife and all good people.</p>
      <p>For the book, I thank you. May the Lord increase this grace to you and keep you in his will. Amen.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most dear patron and brother in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
