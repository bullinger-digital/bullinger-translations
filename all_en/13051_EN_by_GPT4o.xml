    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger was, as always, pleased with Curione's last letter [No. 3000]. Even though he remained silent for a longer time, he has by no means forgotten him! However, both in the public and private spheres, he has a lot to do and cannot always act as he would like. Therefore, if he writes rarely, Curione should not hold it against him. By the way, the educated letter carrier and mutual friend, Pietro Perna, was very welcome to him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Curione is right to consider the present times as disastrous. This is due to the sins of the people. For a long time, the Gospel has been preached and yet continues to be despised. Now the Lord comes and rebukes the sins of his people. If they plead to him and repent, they will surely be delivered from the hands of this godless horde of soldiers, who behave so disgracefully that they (even if God's people would not repent) cannot escape God's punishment. For this, God will either summon the Turkish [Sultan Suleiman] or another terrible enemy to put an end to the atrocities of these soldiers, which is hardly comforting. However, the pious know that the heavenly Father will direct everything for their good. Therefore, those who trust in God can cope with everything, no matter what happens. The Lord is their sure anchor in these stormy waters!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Thanks to Curione for sending his beautiful, useful booklet [„De omni artificio disserendi“] to Bullinger's son Heinrich. He should send another copy to his son Hans Rudolf and include a handwritten dedication, so that any descendants can see that the latter had him as a mentor and patron. This request shows how intimately Bullinger deals with Curione! He should continue to advocate for education and students. The Lord will reward him for this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger must admit that he appreciates and admires Curione's writing against the slanders of Antonio Fiordibello [„Pro vera et antiqua Ecclesiae Christi autoritate oratio“] all the more, the more he reads it. May Curione write more such treatises! Bullinger hopes that Italy will gradually come to rest and recognize its errors. Curione should therefore continue to confess the truth in this way. Greetings, also to his wife [Margarita Bianca, née Isacchi] and to the children, also from Bullinger's wife Anna [née Adlischwyler] and from the whole family.</p>

      <p>Heinrich Bullinger to his dear Celio Secondo Curione, greetings. I read your letters with great pleasure, my esteemed Celio. For everything from you delights me and is dear to me. The fact that I have not written to you for several months is not because I have forgotten you or that your memory has become less valuable to me, but because I am overwhelmed with public and private affairs (as I have often complained to you) and cannot always do what I wish. Therefore, I ask you to interpret my silence kindly, and if I have not written as often as you, out of your love for me, desire, do not interpret it as if I love you less. Furthermore, the very courteous and dear to me Pietro, our mutual friend, was most welcome to me.</p>

      <p>You rightly judge our times to be most calamitous. Indeed, they are as they are said to be! But they are so because of our sins. For many years now, the Gospel of Christ has been vigorously preached, but it has been most stubbornly despised! Therefore, the just God is present and visits the sins of His people. If they cry out to the Lord and repent of their former life, there is no doubt that He will deliver us from the hands of the godless soldiers, who rage and lust so impiously, impurely, inhumanely, and atrociously, as if divine justice could not bear it. You will soon see, even if we have not been justly converted to the Lord in repentance, these impious soldiers will pay the penalty to the just judge, God, who will either raise up the Turk or another fierce enemy to root out these crimes from the earth. This is a miserable consolation, but not even a consolation. The pious know that the heavenly Father does everything for the benefit of the saints. Therefore, they take all events in good part, resting in true trust and hope in the most good and merciful God. We will be happy enough, we will have enough consolation if we consecrate our hearts to God. This will be both the safest and the best anchor in adversities and storms. Meanwhile, let us pray to the Lord to make us such as are approved by Him.</p>

      <p>For the elegant and useful book sent to my son Heinrich, I give you the greatest thanks! And I ask you to send a similar copy to my son Hans Rudolf, but with your handwritten dedication, so that this may also be a testimony to his children, if the Lord grants him any and he lives, that he had Celio as a teacher and patron. See how impudent I am, who dares to ask for another book! But from this, I want you to gather that I use you as my intimate friend. Continue thus to benefit studies and students! The Lord will reward you with a fitting reward.</p>

      <p>Your speech, in which you respond to the slanders of Fiordibello and defend the true authority of the church, the more I read, the more I am compelled to love and praise it. Would that you might also be pleased to write many more such works! I would hope that your Italy would gradually become more gentle and recognize its errors. Therefore, continue in the confession of the truth and live and farewell with your dear wife and dearest children. My wife and my whole family send greetings to you and your entire household. Zürich, August 30.</p>
