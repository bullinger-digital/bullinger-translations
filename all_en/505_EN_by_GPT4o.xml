      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I received your letters, dearest Bullinger. Even if you had not mentioned it in your letters, it is not unknown to me that you are very concerned about my affairs; for from the benevolence we have truly experienced there, not common but truly Christian and fraternal, I can easily judge how much you wish to know after our departure how my family, whom I took away from there while they were feverish, are faring. I hoped that a change of place and air would bring about some change in those with fever, as we often see happen; but in Judith, Salome, and Elias, I was disappointed in this hope; for in them the feverish heat still persists. My wife has recovered by the grace of God; but in her place, Abraham has now been suffering from a severe fever for several days. However, whatever the case may be, although it is quite troublesome, especially because my wife has to endure more inconvenience in domestic care, being deprived of the help of our daughter Judith for so long, we commend it to the divine will and grace, which will also set some limit to this inconvenience, which we hope to obtain through your prayers.</p>
      <p>Everything else is going quite well. The treasurer received me with great kindness, as did many others whose names I do not yet know. I am so close to my dear compatriot Haller that we are separated by only one house, which also brings much comfort. The house we are in is not unattractive, except that it is narrower than what would suffice for such a large family; but this inconvenience has been removed by the use of a small house on the side, which has been vacant and without an inhabitant for some time. Thus, our affairs are now quite comfortable, except that the stipend is insufficient for the expenses I am forced to incur; but perhaps this inconvenience can also be addressed, especially if friends remind the authorities about this matter from time to time. It does not suit my dignity to trouble them for this reason. On the twenty-fifth of April, I began to read Psalm 104 with the intention of finally bringing forth my Psalter, which I have been laboring over for so many years. May the Lord grant that this can be done with the good peace of this nation. Concerning our Erasmus, whom I wish well with his family, I beg you to write what hope you have.</p>
      <p>Bartholomew Metzler from Constance wrote to me, asking for help with his affairs; I would do this willingly if I could do so conveniently. However, since I can achieve nothing here on my own as a newcomer and still ignorant of the churches and places, I consulted with Mr. Haller. He said he had written to Metzler to come here; there are several opportunities by which he can be assisted, provided he is present.</p>
      <p>I beg you not to hesitate to inform this good man as soon as you can. Farewell, dearest of men. Greetings in my name and that of my family to all yours, your wife, children, and Mrs. Klungler, and to all the lords and brothers there, Mr. Pellican, Mr. Theodor, Mr. Gualther. May the Lord preserve you safe and in peace for His church.</p>
      <p>Bern, May 4, 1549.</p>
      <p>Your Wolfgang Musculus in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful leader of the church in Zurich, lord and dearest brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
