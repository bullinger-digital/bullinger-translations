      <p>Johannes Ewich, physician of the Bremen Republic.</p>
      <p>Greetings. Beyond all hope and expectation, it happened, reverend sir, that I am writing this letter to you. For those who recently came to us from the Frankfurt fair, trustworthy men known to you, consistently reported that Bullinger had passed from this world to the heavens. I was truly grieving, not for your sake, but for ours, that the Lord had taken from us a man who could still have been useful to His church, even if he himself, satisfied with life, had been taken from so many troubles to his great benefit. But the gods have given better things, who, foreseeing how great a grief and loss we would have suffered from losing such a noble reputation, have resurrected you to us as if from death, like Lazarus. May God now preserve you for us as long as possible and in good health, whom He wished to restore. However, to resume the interrupted duty of writing, to which you may respond through your son (for I do not wish to burden you, exhausted by age and illnesses), I have decided to describe to you in a few words the state of our neighbors (which I think you wish to know) and the war, just as I have informed Simler about the condition of our churches, which we enjoy at this time. Peace has long been negotiated, but nothing has been achieved. For after securing provisions for their cities during the truce, the impious Spaniard is more inflamed for war.</p>
      <p>A few weeks ago, he seized a very strong and adjacent small town from the Prince of Orange by treachery, with no casualties on either side, and attempted the same, but in vain, in the large city of Gouda. He occupied two small islands near Zeeland, where the enemies are besieged, so that they can hardly escape. He has newly built several galleys in Antwerp, which, to lead them out more safely, he had sent ahead several other warships to a certain shore called Rosendaal. When the Prince of Orange learned of this, he suddenly attacked and captured two, and the others, namely ten, were sacrificed to Vulcan as if to be purified by fire as heretics. The Spaniards are now besieging the small town of Oudewater (called Ouwater by the Dutch), which is quite strong, where they have twice attempted an assault not without loss to the attackers. They say that several captured Spaniards, among the principal ones, have been brought into the city, but since it happened very recently, we have not yet fully learned the whole matter. The commander of the garrison in the city of Groningen recently captured three not large ships, in which there were Danes, Holsteiners, Dithmarschers, and Antwerp papists, all merchants, not enemies, seeking Holland for the sake of trade, whom he drowned without distinction and without any compassion, and thus he seems to spare no one henceforth. It is very surprising that he does this with impunity to foreign and innocent nations. Those who previously brought him aid, he thus repays with gratitude, and rightly so it happens to them, who, for the sake of profit, betrayed their country and religion, and in previous years brought assistance to the Spaniards in droves. To the remaining Dutch, almost all the Spaniard's efforts are a joke, and they are not moved, indeed they despise whatever he contrives, partly trusting in God's help and partly in the nature of the region. The Bishop of Cologne, offended by the rebellion of some Paderborners, set fire to their fields, but was forced to desist by the threats of neighboring princes. Various and uncertain things are reported about the French; however, it is certain that the king has suffered several defeats. The plague occupies nearby places; it has not yet reached us, but we expect it daily, and it can hardly be that we are safe, because of the constantly frequent merchants exchanging with each other. Meanwhile, there is a great harvest of grain, but no greater benefit due to human greed. As much as God's beneficence increases, so much does charity and equity decrease. These things, because I had nothing else to write, venerable Bullinger, I wanted to inform you of in passing, both to confirm our custom and to let you know something about our affairs and to aid the oppressed churches everywhere with your prayers in the most unjust wars. I wish in return to learn from you, whether you have any spirit left besides the coming of the Lord of Hosts, who alone will put an end to all the troubles of His elect and restore them to eternal happiness, which may He grant to you and to us, who reigns forever and ever. We greet your son and all the other colleagues from the heart, except for one, all of us. Farewell in the Lord as rightly as possible and love us.</p>
      <p>Given in the year 75, August 19, in Bremen.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and reverend man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zurich and my lord to be reverently observed as a father. Zurich.</p>
