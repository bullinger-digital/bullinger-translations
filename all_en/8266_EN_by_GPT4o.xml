      <p> Greetings. On the 9th of May, Mr. Haller sent me these letters, which I should ensure are delivered to you. I did not want to deny this duty to either of you, as I hope it will be appreciated. If nothing else, you will let me know whether you have received them or not, so that if they are not delivered, I can more easily inquire and find out whose fault it is. I don't think you expect any news from me, as I am not a very curious person. However, so that you do not receive these letters completely empty: it is said that the Emperor has summoned Johann Wilhelm of Saxony to him for some unknown reason, some say because of his captive brother, others because of a dispute with Elector August arising from a theological disagreement, which is said to be spreading and growing daily, and indeed spreading in such a way that there is a dangerous risk of war arising from it, which would be harmful to many. </p>
      <p> It is said that Elector August has sent letters to the Senate of Strasbourg, in which he severely accuses Illyricus and requests that he be expelled from the city. You will learn the rest from the letters of others. </p>
      <p> Mr. Hoser and Treschius send you their warm regards. Farewell and continue to love me, my most kind Mr. Bullinger, and greet your colleagues. </p>
      <p> Farewell. </p>
      <p> Augsburg, 16th of May, 1570. </p>
      <p> Your Matthias Schenck. </p>
      <p> To the most excellent man and theologian Heinrich Bullinger, my esteemed lord and friend. </p>
      <p> ZÃ¼rich. </p>
