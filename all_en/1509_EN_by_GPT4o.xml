      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>That you have not received any letters from me before now, dearest Bullinger, - by which I could both testify to my goodwill towards you, which you have earned by many reasons, and give thanks from the heart for your incredible kindness towards me, which I have very clearly perceived, - there was no other reason than the affairs of our republic, to which all my effort, labor, and diligence had to be devoted, unless I wanted to completely fail in my duty to God, my dignity, and the expectations of many. Therefore, you will easily bear this long delay, especially since you trust that my love for you can in no way, and much less by time, be diminished. Regarding the booklet, which you published under the auspices of my name, I give thanks not only for myself but also for the entire Christian church, recognizing the divine goodness and (as it is with Paul) philanthropy towards His church, that He wished to adorn and illuminate His church with such lights, so that we who are more unlearned may follow as guides those who can, for the gifts they have received from God, and who are willing, for their piety towards their brothers, to diligently point out the way that must be followed. Indeed, it would have been over for us, had He not prepared such pillars in His church, which could support it, otherwise without any doubt, it would collapse. I also confess that I owe you much even in the name of my daughter, because with your most holy writings you always encourage true faith in Christ, the study of the Holy Scriptures, integrity of morals, and innocence of life; which I earnestly urge you to continue doing as diligently as possible. Farewell, most distinguished Bullinger, and may God, the best and greatest, prosper your efforts in the church and always protect you! From my house in London, December 21, 1551.</p>
      <p>Henry, Duke of Suffolk.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest brother.</p>
