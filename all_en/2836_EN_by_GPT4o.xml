      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father through Christ the Savior, etc.</p>
      <p>Georg, formerly the public scribe of the Republic of Memmingen, reverend lord and brother in Christ, sent me these notes, wishing that after reading them and sharing them with the other brothers and good men, I would send them at the first opportunity to the most honorable man, Consul Habius. However, since the rumor here is not entirely uncertain that he has been appointed as a legate for the Republic of Geneva and has already gone to Bern, I wanted to share them with you, having conveniently found a courier, on the condition that you offer the sealed letters to the consul as soon as possible along with the attached notes upon his return, or if you see it worthwhile, send them to Bern, so that I can also account for my entrusted duty.</p>
      <p>We have again presented the cause and exile of the Locarnese to our magistrate, yet we do not see that he has arranged any assistance to alleviate their poverty. However, we hear by rumor that if they come to ask for alms, their efforts will not be in vain; for they say that even the people of Basel have not yet sent anything to them. Therefore, if our help is needed further in this matter, we will be entirely at their service. Lastly, our Jacob recently wrote to you about the prison where, along with nocturnal thieves, the great envoys of God and our Savior Jesus Christ are punished, to the great contempt of our common ministry, where there would be many more suitable and less offensive ways to decide the punishment for wrongdoers, which sometimes seems to fall even on the innocent, such as deprivation of office for a few months or, if the case warrants, permanently, or some private prison or any other method by which (in our judgment) the church would be better served. We certainly do not wish to prescribe to anyone; however, we await your judgment, especially since you were recently unable to write due to your health. Therefore, if you have time, we ask that you write to us about the decisions of your synod's council on these matters; for, to confess frankly, we are also quite offended by this matter.</p>
      <p>You can easily guess what drives us to these concerns. A rumor is spreading among us that it is forbidden among you to reprint Gualther's Antichrist, which we would like to know. Sebastian, RÃ¼ger, and the others greet you. Please also greet in my name Mr. Theodor, Pellican, Gualther, and everyone. Hastily from Schaffhausen in the year 1556, 7 days before the Kalends of March.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely from the heart, Simprecht Vogt.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and virtuous man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and brother in Christ, to be greatly respected, the first and most vigilant fellow minister of the Church of Zurich.</p>
