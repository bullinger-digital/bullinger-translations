      <p>To the most reverend bishop of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Taddeo Duno sends greetings.</p>
      <p>In the letters I sent to you (most kind Heinrich) a few days ago, I faithfully explained the situation as it happened in Locarno; then I repeatedly urged that, as much as it is in your power, you ensure that our church is not oppressed by persecutions. Since this has begun with good auspices and because you are moving every stone so that the Gospel of Jesus Christ can be safely preached among us, I indeed give you and the other ministers of your church the greatest thanks I can on behalf of the entire church. However, since we cannot repay you, be assured that our Savior will return a hundredfold joy for such a small labor. For nothing is as certain as that those who fight for Christ will be blessed forever. Since God has promised the kingdom of heaven, which is eternal, to his children, I say, to those who have embraced Christ as their Savior, how can it be otherwise? Therefore, come on, most illustrious Heinrich, strive, watch, work, so that Christian pastors among us can perform their duties fearlessly, namely to teach the truth and administer the sacraments purely, otherwise, we will have to say farewell to our homeland altogether; for if it is not allowed at home to lead a life worthy of a Christian man, at least it will be allowed abroad, wherever the Lord wills. And do not think that we are three or four, indeed we are very many, although many are somewhat weaker and need milk rather than solid food. Therefore, if through you we can arrange what is necessary for the Christian church, there is no doubt that soon all our citizens will believe, with the Lord's favor. You will also learn from the letters of our church, which are attached to this, both our spirit and our faith and also the love with which we rightly pursue you. May the heavens grant that we obtain from the orators what we pray for. May our Lord Jesus Christ keep you safe for your church for as long as possible, and may his peace and grace be multiplied to you, amen.</p>
      <p>Locarno, the day before the calends of October 1549.</p>
