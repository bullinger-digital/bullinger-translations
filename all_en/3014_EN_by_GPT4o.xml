      <p>Wittenberg. After sealing my letters, which I sent to you, this honorable young man Albert Brinck, a native of Gelderland, informed me that he would accompany Mr. Rudolf Collin on his journey and earnestly requested that I commend him to you, which I gladly did, not so much for his learning as for his integrity of life. For he, a lover of Christ and preferring the sincere and pure doctrine of the gospel to the impure teachings of the papists, left behind his parents, relatives, friends, and his homeland of Gelderland, and came to Wittenberg, where he lived piously and honorably, diligently engaged in the study of letters for half a year. Now, because perhaps the Swiss churches please him more than the Saxon ones, he has decided to set out for Switzerland. Therefore, I commend this honorable, pious, and learned young man to your kindness and ask that you assist him in all ways you can. If you cannot help him in the matter he seeks with you due to the multitude of students you support, nevertheless, assist him with your testimony or some recommendation in Basel or elsewhere among learned men. I wanted to write these few words to you because of the familiarity and friendship that was between us.</p>
      <p>Farewell now forever, dearest father. Heinrich Bullinger, your beloved son.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished and excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, head of the church in the city of Zurich, his beloved father. Zurich.</p>
