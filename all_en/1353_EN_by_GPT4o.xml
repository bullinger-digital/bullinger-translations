      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear friend, we are sending you herewith two treatises by P. Vergerius, recently published against the Pope and the proposed council in Basel, from which you may understand and perceive more than we can, etc., as well as a treatise that has been written to our cousin H. Christoph. Additionally, we did not want to withhold from you the enclosed news that was graciously sent to us. Dated Urdorf, the 24th of July, in the year 1551.</p>
      <p>A dreadful, burdensome incident has occurred with the undersigned in Zurich, as you undoubtedly have learned. May God forgive him and be gracious to him with a joyful resurrection; may the merciful God grant this to us all. Amen. It would be good if he were removed from there, as it leads more to a spectacle than to praise or honor; in this, you will know how to proceed further.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
