      <p> Greetings. On the 12th, instead of the council meeting, my messenger arrived. I immediately took care of your letters in the most certain way, sought out Sepianus, showed him your letter. He informed me that it was secretly decided to write to our delegates not to accept anything that is detrimental to the faith. However, if it cannot be otherwise, they should explain themselves, as they have done everything possible to avoid it. Since it is detrimental to our faith, my lords do not want to have anything to do with it, yet they should explain themselves if anyone understands that armed and equipped (armed) forces are passing through their land and territory (earth, area), they will not allow it, but will protect their land and territory from force. This I learned from Sepianus. Although it has come to this, that those from the city and land of Solothurn should withdraw at all times and wait for what the arbitrators decide for us, except for the 8 men they first requested, who should vacate their land and offer space. </p>
      <p> Then four Solothurn Catholics came to a farmer, who was armed with a halberd and a battle sword, and asked him where he wanted to go. He confessed, "To our brothers of the faith." They attacked him, he defended himself and struck two of them dead. If the others had not retreated, it would have gone badly for them as well. </p>
      <p> This is what I have now. You will find me tireless, as long as I have messengers whom I can trust. </p>
      <p> Farewell as above. </p>
      <p> B. H. </p>
      <p> To his Heinrich Bullinger, dearest brother beyond all measure. </p>
