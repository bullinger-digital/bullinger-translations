    <p xml:id="regest1">The letters from Gilbert Cousin [18060 from March 17, 1548] and Gast [18057 from March 13, 1548] were certainly delivered by the reliable messengers [Antoine Cousin and N.N.].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">Gast reliably took care of forwarding the letter [not received] to the [or from the?] Lady of Stadion [N.N.].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Strange that Bullinger [in his last, not received letter] did not share any news.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">Recently, he reported on the brawl of the lads [from Gaienhofen, Hemmenhofen, Feldbach, and Steckborn]. And now Gast can report a very similar incident from the inn "Zum Neuen Haus," not far from Basel [in Kleinhüningen], where Margrave Ernst of Baden-Durlach and the city of Basel share the tax revenues and jurisdiction: There, on Sunday, March 18 [1548], [imperial] Landsknechte joined the drinking of young lads and journeymen from various regions. It became tense when a journeyman baker from Uri [N.N.] no longer wanted to drink with the Landsknechte and therefore knocked one of them down. However, the dispute could be settled. Then the approximately eight [present] Confederates were provoked by about thirty peasants standing in front of the inn, shouting ("Here is Austria!" and "Here is the Margraviate!"). They could still hold back. But when they were grossly insulted, they attacked them, whereupon an approximately one-hour brawl began on the imperial territory, in which nine men were seriously injured. The innkeeper [N.N.] threw stones at the Confederates. He has been on the run since then, but he will still receive his punishment! [Nevertheless] the latter could decide the brawl for themselves. Only one man from Uri [N.N.] was captured by the peasants and brought to Rötteln Castle. A proper brawl!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">When King Ferdinand I learned of the joint war chest of the nobles [of Further Austria] filled with 8,000 guilders, he claimed the money for himself. When they refused, he threatened them with disgrace. The nobility is in a bad way! But it serves them right.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Many rumors are circulating, but Gast does not believe them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Many faithful are fleeing the cruelty of Emperor Charles V to Basel. There, an unknown disease is now spreading, causing the body to swell as if poisoned. Some are taken by it, others survive. New people, new faith, new diseases, and new customs...</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">Greetings. The letter carrier [Fernando Díaz Paterniano], who can report in detail on the situation of Martin Bucer, is recommended to Bullinger.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord. I do not doubt that you have received the letters from Gilbert and myself. For I entrusted them to reliable men.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Similarly, I took care to deliver the next letters to the Lady of Stadion.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>It is strange, however, that you did not add even a word about new matters.</p>

      <p>You recently wrote to me about the brawl of the lads. It would not be inappropriate to also narrate what happened here: There is an inn called "Zum Neuen Haus," right near Basel (a horse's gallop away). It is under the joint jurisdiction and tax of the Margrave and Basel. There, the young journeymen drank on Judica Sunday. Then Landsknechte came and drank with them. There were also journeymen from many lands. One from Uri did not want to keep drinking with the Landsknechte. Then a commotion started, and the journeyman baker knocked a Landsknecht to the ground, saying: "Must I drink when you want?" Peace was made. Afterwards, some went outside the inn and shouted: "Here is Austria," and the others: "Here is the Margraviate." There were about eight Confederates. They sat quietly until they were provoked and shouted: "Where are the cowards and scoundrels?" Then ours rushed out, behind the peasants, who were about 30, and chased each other in the field for about an hour. About nine were seriously wounded. The innkeeper then threw stones at ours, and now he has fled. But he will get his share. Ours held the field. One from Uri remained, whom the peasants captured and took to Rötteln Castle. Thus, everything led to a brawl.</p>

      <p>King Ferdinand has learned that the nobility has gathered 8,000 guilders for a joint armament in case something arises. He wants to have it. He first asked for it, then, when it was refused, he threatened to take the money by withdrawing all his favor. The nobility is not well off. But they are rightly dealt with.</p>

      <p>Many other vain rumors are spreading, which I do not believe.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Pious men are flocking to us, fleeing the cruelty of the Emperor. Moreover, an unheard-of disease is spreading among us: Bodies swell as if they had absorbed poison. Some are overcome by the disease, some escape it. New people, new faith, new diseases, and customs.</p>

      <p>Farewell. I commend to you Mr. Ferdinand, the bearer of this letter, an excellent brother, from whom you can learn much about the state of Bucer. Basel, March 23, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, G.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished theologian Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his dearest in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
