      <p>Greetings. I wrote previously that our people were content with renewing the covenant in its old form, but because it was otherwise pleasing to the people of Bern, they moderated themselves. It has finally come to the point that in the main point, which the people of Bern were most pressing, our people preferred to yield rather than bear the blame of stubbornness. Having conceded this, we hoped they would be appeased, so that they would not be so troublesome about the rest. When this expectation was disappointed, our people implore the faith of your most illustrious council, so that with friendly intercession the people of Bern may be inclined to fairness. And hence you see how truly I have asserted to you that there is no fear that our people would adopt any turbulent plan, as was suspected by Bern or at least rumored. But it would be superfluous to burden the messenger, who will best fulfill the role of a living letter, with a longer writing. I ask nothing of you privately, except that you confirm your friends, who are already, as I trust, willing, with your authority.</p>
      <p>Regarding the refutation of Westphal, of which I send you a copy, I eagerly wish to know what you yourself think, and what the judgment of others there is. I see that I was somewhat more vehement than I had intended. But somehow, while dictating, I let myself go. If the book is not pleasing, at least it may be testified that it was not written by me. But without joking, I hope it will be so pleasing to you and the rest of the brothers that no excuse will be needed. However, you will freely express whatever seems right to you. Perhaps something will also be published by you, which could serve as a place for criticism: because from there it will certainly be clear what reasoning was approved by you. I see one thing, that I have so provoked the hatred of those who have hitherto been hostile to you, that in the war they wage with me, a truce may be brought to you. May the Lord therefore add courage and strength to me to sustain this burden. Farewell, most distinguished man, and brother much esteemed by me in the Lord.</p>
      <p>My colleagues greet you. In turn, greet yours in my name. May the Lord preserve, guide, and bless you perpetually with your wife and family.</p>
      <p>Geneva, January 23, 1556.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and faithful minister of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich, my most esteemed colleague.</p>
