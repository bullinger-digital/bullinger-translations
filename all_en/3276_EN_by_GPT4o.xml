      <p>Greetings. I give you immense thanks for the diligent account of the events that took place with you and in Romania. The day before, Peter Perna, returning from Milan, recited the same about the papist Swiss being slain at Paleano, and he also brought letters from the city of Venice dated August 1st by Mr. Friedrich von Salis, confirming the same and designating the day of the defeat as July 23rd. It is to be lamented that so many souls are indeed in peril, but in the meantime, the Lord is to be praised in His holy judgments; may He, I pray, turn all things to the glory of His name. Our confederates could not meet at the assembly in Baden held on account of the king, but they returned home divided in different opinions; for there are those who complain that soldiers were led to Naples through Milan against the agreements. These deny soldiers to the king; others think that now is the time to assist the king in peril and our struggling people. The people of Glarus, Basel, Schaffhausen, and some others, as I hear, have denied soldiers; however, the people of Lucerne or some others are said to be preparing an expedition, and when the people of Schwyz reported the king's request to the assembly, they were so hostile that they almost resorted to arms. Indeed, they did not grant soldiers to the king, and many even shouted that the alliance with the king should be renounced. And these things indeed happened before the rumor spread that the pope's banners had been cut down. What do you think will happen now, what if they hear that war is now being waged against Ferrara? Will they easily understand that the paths are closed to those who are with Guise? Let us pray to the Lord to temper all these matters to the glory of His name; for everything is fraught with dangers.</p>
      <p>Live and farewell with the honorable consuls and Philipp and Pontasella and all friends.</p>
      <p>You will commend me and greet most diligently Mr. Matthias Coignet.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 20, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Take care of these letters, I beseech you, diligently. To the highly and well-learned, pious and faithful Mr. Johannes Schmid, pastor at Chur by Saint Martin, his dear lord and brother. Chur.</p>
