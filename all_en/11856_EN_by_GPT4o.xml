He married his son Samuel to Küngold, the daughter of Hans von Schönau, a citizen of Zurich. Many honorable people from Bern, Biel, and Neuchâtel also came down to us, among whom was Hans Wunderlich, the negotiator of the Frenchman Francis I. This morning, he received news by a messenger traveling from Lyon to Venice that on the night of October 30th, Emperor Charles V had fled from the field with his troops. The messenger was dispatched on Saturday from Lyon and is hurrying to Venice. Tomorrow, he also expects other news that will show the matter more completely and accurately. What if the withdrawal is just a feint? God protect us from the Spaniards. Farewell. Given on Tuesday, November 6th.</p>
