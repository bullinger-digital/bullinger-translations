      <p>Greetings and Peace. As soon as I arrived in Basel, most illustrious lord and most revered teacher in Christ, my first concern was to inquire about suitable lodging. I first approached Mr. Oporinus, to whom I delivered your letters.</p>
      <p>After reading them, he diligently inquired about the state of your affairs; I said that everything was well. In our first conversation, he offered me lodging and asked for forty crowns.</p>
      <p>I thanked him for his prompt and benevolent disposition towards me; but I thought that nothing should be done rashly, as this matter brings much inconvenience if it turns out unfavorably, and much convenience if it turns out favorably and successfully. I first thought I should approach Celius, because my father wished that, (if I ever came to Basel) I should be with him.</p>
      <p>He promised all his effort and support; but for various reasons, he said he could not take me into his household, the main one being the scarcity of provisions and the high cost of everything. Finally, with the help of some friends, a certain honest and moderately learned man took me in; I am with him until some suitable lodging is found for me. However it turns out, I see that I will be treated much more inconveniently (as far as provisions are concerned) than with you, most illustrious man; but, (as you know), I am content with very little. You have the state of my affairs; by the blessing of the most good and great God, I am well, and everything is going according to my wishes.</p>
      <p>When I diligently recall the great benefits I have received from you, most excellent lord, I do not seem to myself ever able to repay them; but your singular and almost divine kindness refreshes me, for which a grateful mind and a desire to please in every way is as good as a great gift; this, my lord, I ask you to accept and to persuade yourself that I am most observant of you.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent lord, in Christ Jesus. Greet your wife reverently in my words (if it is not burdensome) and your daughters Alexia and Dorothea, and your most illustrious sons-in-law Mr. Lavater and Mr. Simler.</p>
      <p>Again and again, farewell in Christ, most esteemed teacher.</p>
      <p>On the very first day of March, hastily from Basel. Your most observant, Johannes Utenhove.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious lord by doctrine and virtue, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, bishop of the Church of Zurich, his much-revered lord and teacher. To Zurich.</p>
      <p>Johannes Utenhove 1564.</p>
