    <p xml:id="regest1">The unknown author of the "Speculum Osiandri", who apparently knows Osiander well, could be [Thomas] Venatorius. Gast is not aware of the existence of a commentary on the Apocalypse by Johannes Hus; to his knowledge, however, Hus' letters contain statements about the Roman beast [i.e., the Pope as Antichrist]. He did not meet the letter carrier [Johannes] Wolf; [Johannes] Oporin sends eight copies of the Greece map [by Nikolaos Sophianos] for Bullinger and his colleagues; Gast does not know if Oporin gave Wolf a letter. A rumor says that the French [King Francis I] has defeated the Emperor [Charles V], and 6000 Swiss Confederates have fallen; if this is true, the survivors will soon report. References to new publications in Basel will follow in the next letter. Greetings; Gast will soon write to Theodor [Bibliander].</p>

      <p>I am completely unaware of the author of the "Speculum Osiandri", but I suspect it might be Venatorius, although I cannot determine anything for certain. The author will soon become known to both you and me. It must have been someone close to Osiander, who knew his life very well.</p>
      <p>The lid of the pot was very fitting. Regarding the commentaries of Johannes Hus on the Apocalypse that you mentioned, I do not know if they exist; for I have never seen any of that good man's works. Some letters of Hus have been published, in which, if I remember correctly, he discusses certain passages about that Roman beast.</p>
      <p>I did not see your Wolf; for I was not at home when he brought me the letters. Our Oporin sends you a map of Greece, for Theodor, Frisius, Pellicanus, Gwalther, Sebastian, and Gesner. Your Wolf will receive the eighth copy. I do not know whether he wrote through your Wolf or not.</p>
      <p>There is a rumor that the Frenchman has fought with the Emperor and that the Frenchman has gained victory, with 6000 Swiss Confederates fallen in that battle, and the Emperor eventually put to flight; but I write nothing certain here. Soon, if anything has happened, our people, without a doubt, if any have survived, will write.</p>
      <p>I will inform you about the books published here in my next letter. Farewell. September 5, Basel, 1544.</p>
      <p>Greet your wife and all the brothers. I will write to Theodor soon. Yours, Gast.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, a most esteemed friend. Zurich.</p>
