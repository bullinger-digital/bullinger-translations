      <p>S. P. Yesterday, young Froschauer brought us your letters, honorable lord and godfather, along with the Latin and German preface to the Apocalypse, as well as some of your other sermons on the same subject. By chance, he also brought Apiarius, with whom he might have been negotiating about the work, but he did not find him at home. For two days ago, he set out for Basel and from there, if circumstances allow, as I hear, he will go to Zurich. Meanwhile, nothing could be done here except this one thing: that your letters, along with the work itself and the prefaces, were presented to Lord Haller, as the primary schoolmaster. Musculus and I, according to your instructions, have so far concealed that we had the work in our hands. Now, according to the decree of the senate, it will also be read by others. However, since this cannot be done in one or two days, especially as most are now occupied with the celebration of the Lord's Nativity, Froschauer returns to you. I will hasten as much as possible so that after the holidays it will be read by everyone, and to make this happen more quickly, I will divide the parts among individuals so that several can read at the same time.</p>
      <p>After reading the work, the schoolmasters will confer and report their opinion to the senate. Once this has been done and the senate has decreed that it should be printed, I will ensure that Apiarius goes to Zurich and brings with him one or two printed sheets as a sample, so that you can inspect the letter and Froschauer can negotiate with him.</p>
      <p>I have read the preface and desire nothing except that I am stuck on assigning the names of the consuls. Nägelin is now in charge and indeed in office, but another precedes in authority; therefore, Nägelin should be placed before the other in terms of office, which I do not know how willingly the other, a man whom I once described to you, will take. It seems to me it would be better to simply dedicate it to the consuls and senate without naming names, as the German preface also has; thus, all would seem equally honored.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, there is nothing to write. Froschauer reported to us from your mouth that Philipp in Wittenberg has a dismissal and will succeed Dr. Martyr in Strasbourg; I am therefore surprised that you did not mention this in your letters. Therefore, we ask you to inform us of this as soon as you can. There is nothing new, except that many Swiss soldiers are said to have perished from the cold on the journey; in Geneva (it is certainly reported) two collapsed on the bridge itself and soon expired there. This also happened to some not far from Freiburg. These are great judgments of God; nevertheless, with stiff necks, they all proceed like a horse rushing to the slaughter, as our prophet [Apocalypse?] says.</p>
      <p>Farewell. My family and I greet you and yours, and especially my mother sends her diligent greetings to you in return, and we wish you a prosperous and happy year.</p>
      <p>In Bern, on the eve of the Lord's Nativity, 1556. Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>I am sending here the letters of a certain French minister of the Bernese dominion, in which he wrote his opinion about that number 666 in the Apocalypse to our Musculus three years ago, I think; you can inspect it if you please.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, his most esteemed and dear lord and godfather.</p>
      <p>December 24, 1556.</p>
