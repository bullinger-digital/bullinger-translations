    <p xml:id="regest1">Inquires whether he should send a messenger to Strasbourg to take care of the affairs [of his deceased son] Heinrich, or if he should come to Zurich for a conversation with Bullinger. His wife, to whom he communicated Heinrich's death early the previous day, showed great strength; the words of comfort from Pastor [Hans Seebach] were also a great help.</p>

      <p>May the grace of God always be with us and protect us from sorrow and suffering, etc. To begin with, well-learned, honorable, and my especially trusted, kind, and dear sir, etc.</p>
      <p>As I requested in yesterday's letter, if you deem it necessary for me to send a messenger to Strasbourg, so that if Heinrich owes something, it can be paid, or if the matter can be settled in another way and with fewer costs, I ask for a prompt response, or if I should come to you myself and discuss it with you in person.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, my especially friendly and dear sir, you should know that yesterday morning at half past four, I informed my wife of the matter, and in such a way that she should not think I am burdened with any illness, because I lay all night with great grief; for I will recover. But if God the Lord had struck us again with some misfortune, I earnestly ask her not to be frightened, but to offer the matter to God alone; He will compensate us. And especially if Heinrich were with God the Lord, etc. When she looked at me, she said: "This is not a misfortune, it is God's order; for He has given and taken away." If only he were now with us, so that we could give him advice. Yet I can do nothing for him. If he has not fallen dead or been struck down, I must endure it; but if this happens, I would not know how to overcome the matter. In the meantime, our preacher came, took her gently by the hand, so that she is completely resigned. She did ask me yesterday and last night several times if I knew how long he had been lying and what was wrong with him. And always: if he has now died in bed in the name of God! And she comforts me very gently, although I try my utmost to hide my distress from her. Some of my writing may reveal my friendly opinion of me: for it is done out of special trust to you alone. I can well imagine that you have other matters to attend to, but I have the hope and heart towards you that it brings you no displeasure or unwillingness. For by nature, good friends confide their concerns to each other in times of need and adversity. So it is truly with me towards you. I would have written to you much more about this unfortunate event, but I will not burden you further at this time; for my heart and mind are greatly burdened with grief and sorrow. For I fear the wrath of God upon me. But you should also know my great heart and mind towards my gracious Lord and God, and that I have a firm trust in Him, that He will not abandon me, even if He seeks me out in this way. Who can fathom His judgment and purpose here? He may do it for my good rather than to my detriment. May His will always be done and grant me grace for patience and overcoming my life. Amen.</p>
      <p>May the gracious God keep you in health and also protect you and those dear to you from sorrow, suffering, and tribulation.</p>
      <p>Dated the 14th of July, in the year 1535.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant always,</p>
      <p>Hans R. Lavater.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, honorable Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the Zurich foundation, my especially kind and dear sir.</p>
