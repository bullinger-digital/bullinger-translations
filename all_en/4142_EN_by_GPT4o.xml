      <p>Greetings. I have just received a rather sad letter from my son, written on November 1st in Venice, in which he complains to me that he receives no letters through the Rhaetians, that he is completely abandoned and weakened by fevers, staying at the school of the bakers, which I understand to be a hostel. The poor man is now suffering because he went to Italy against my advice.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I am tormented and exhausted by expenses. In Treviso, he owes 5 florins to the host of the White Rose, and he owes others elsewhere; the expenses increase daily. But this loss would be easy to bear if only his health were intact and sound, or if the illness would remit just a little, so that he could return home through Augsburg. I pray to the Lord to be with him and me in this matter.</p>
      <p>I am writing to him in the enclosed letter, advising him on what to do, although I doubt whether he is still there.</p>
      <p>But I beseech you and implore you by our friendship to ensure that this letter is delivered to Venice. For I hear that good men from your area or through you frequently travel there, to whom you can entrust this letter. Furthermore, I am negotiating with some people from St. Gallen to provide him with travel money, if he is still there. You know that I have entrusted you with at least two or three letters addressed to him over the past six months. I do not doubt your fidelity, but it is possible that those to whom you gave the letters have failed.</p>
      <p>If you love me, take care of this diligently.</p>
      <p>Deliver to Peter Roos at the White Lion in Venice; he knows where my son is.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Zurich, December 3, 1559. Most urgently.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Friedrich von Salis, my most esteemed lord and dearest brother, commissioner of Chiavenna.</p>
