    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Bullinger likely learned from Peter Schnyder of Aarburg that Pfister had dealings with some preachers [Johannes Ulrich Göppel and Benedikt Schürmeister] from Zofingen. However, this is not to be elaborated here. Benedikt Schürmeister was ultimately declared the main responsible party for the dispute. He had to swear in Bern to adhere to the [Ten Conclusions] of the Bern Disputation, which is based on God's Word, and was also forced to sign them. Yet, afterwards, a dispute broke out again between him and Schnyder, whereupon both signed a settlement agreement, which Schürmeister did not adhere to. Therefore, he had to be reported to the Bernese authorities.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Pfister heard that Schürmeister was in Zurich and that Bullinger had discussed with him his views on faith and especially his conception of the Lord's Supper. At that time, it probably did not seem appropriate for Schürmeister to justify his stance. However, Pfister learned from Schnyder that Schürmeister intended to present his conception of the Lord's Supper to Bullinger in writing. However, Schnyder did not know how and when this would happen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Since Pfister had much to do with the preachers, he now asks Bullinger, if it is not too bothersome for him, to send him Schürmeister's treatise through Schnyder. Pfister will show his gratitude for this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger should kindly receive this letter, written with good intentions. May the Lord protect him!</p>

      <p>My friendly greetings and willing service beforehand, gracious and dear sir. As I assume that you are likely well informed and have been notified by Peter Schnyder of Aarburg about some dealings I had with certain preachers in Zofingen, it is not necessary to elaborate on this now (however, the last matter concerning the aforementioned preachers has remained partly with Benedikt Schürmeister, who confirmed in Bern with an oath and signature to teach nothing other than what is upheld in the praiseworthy disputation through God's word), and after this oath, some dispute arose again between the named Mr. Peter and him, a settlement was made again, to be upheld with the signing of his name, but not adhered to by the aforementioned Schürmeister. Therefore, his transgression was reported to my gracious lords.</p>

      <p>However, I have heard that Mr. Benedikt was with you in Zurich and that you discussed with him his beliefs and teachings, especially concerning the Lord's Supper, to provide his explanation on this matter, which at that time did not seem appropriate for him to justify. Mr. Peter from Aarburg partly informed me that Mr. Benedikt intended to present his explanation regarding the words concerning the Lord's Supper or the Lord's Evening Meal in writing to you, but he could not specifically indicate to me how or in what form it would be given.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>And on this matter, dear sir, since you are partly aware of how much I have had to deal with them, my friendly request to you is, if it is not too burdensome for you, that you would send me Mr. Benedikt's treatise on the Lord's Supper through Mr. Peter. If I could earn and deserve this through your grace, I would do so with good will and gladly.</p>

      <p>Gracious and dear sir, you should receive this letter from me in good faith, as it is written with the best intentions. Herewith, may the Almighty God protect and shield you. Given on Thursday, the 29th day of September in the year 1547. Vincenz Pfister, your willing servant in Aarburg.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich, my dear and good patron, to be delivered.</p>
