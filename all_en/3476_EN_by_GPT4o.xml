      <p>Greetings. It was very pleasing for me to learn from your letters about your health, and the concern you have taken for my chests and the host at the Stork, for which I am grateful. I believe that the lord legate of St. Laurent has written so that I might have them while I am here. If nothing has yet been accomplished, I would wish, since I am soon to return to Cambrai, that, when convenience and opportunity present themselves, he would send them as far as Baden to the master of the post and the cups, unless it is more convenient to send them all the way to Geneva to Mr. Normandie or the city syndics, who will pay what has been agreed upon for the transport.</p>
      <p>There is no need to fear that anyone will cause him trouble or controversy if anything is lost, as long as he has shown the diligence and good faith that anyone would wish for in a friend's affairs, and I ask you to be a guarantor. The lord legate has promised me that he will write to both the master of the post, and there is nothing that presses or cannot bear delay and wait for a faithful and suitable carrier; for perhaps the lord will grant me that I may soon see you and speak with you in a friendly manner. Farewell and love us, and please greet our mutual friends.</p>
      <p>Payerne, January 16.</p>
      <p>The lord legate has communicated to me what you recently wrote to him.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Matthieu Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
