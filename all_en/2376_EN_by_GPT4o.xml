      <p>Greetings. I received your letter along with the English booklet, and everything was most pleasing to me; but now that kingdom is in great turmoil.</p>
      <p>The Emperor triumphs at the Pope's court, because the Queen is related to him, and she promises everything concerning religion. And indeed, you should know for certain that the Mass has already been reinstated and everything has been changed again in a remarkable way.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, an English nobleman was here with me, who is traveling to Rome via royal posts, and he told me that this change is certain.</p>
      <p>Among other things, he has letters from Queen Mary to Cardinal Pole, and he is summoned; I believe he is already on his way, which the Englishman also hopes.</p>
      <p>In Picardy, everything is going well; when there was to be a battle, the enemies fled. But I refer you to the copy of the letters I wrote to our confederates; if you please, you may give this to the lords and the council. The King wants to prolong the war throughout the whole winter, and I believe he will send those six thousand soldiers to Italy, where everything is also going well; for Lord Ferrand retreated with our forces into Piedmont with great loss to his own. We have no certain news about that Albert; it is written to me that he is dead and was killed in a second conflict by the Grumsheisens; but the one who writes this gives little credence; therefore, I doubt. Farewell most excellently. From Solothurn, August 27th.</p>
      <p>Yours always, from Basse-Fontaine.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man and friend, Lord Bullinger.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
