      <p> Greetings. I thought, most excellent and wise Bullinger, that the Council of Trent was over, [when I heard] that a war had broken out in Italy between the Pope, the Emperor, and the French; but when I saw today monks and Louvain theologians, as well as some bishops, hurrying to Trent, I greatly fear that this war is something monstrous and that the aforementioned three great heads are merely a kind of collusion, whereby only the papal side has safe access, with the Emperor on one side and the French on the other blocking the path of the pious, who perhaps were going to support the endangered piety and were going to gather there. Add to this, that in the meantime, that... head, as if surrounded on both sides by an army and armed soldiers as if by hired guards, may decide about our religion according to its own pleasure. I greatly fear that the time is near or at least not far off, about which John speaks in his Revelation concerning that destructive beast: "It was given to it to make war with the saints and to overcome them," and also "and all who dwell on the earth will worship it, whose names are not written in the book of life of the Lamb, who was slain from the foundation of the world." </p>
      <p> A truly formidable sentence for the doubters, but consoling for the pious, whose names are written in that book, who are chosen in Christ before the foundations of the world were made, who hear the voice of their shepherd and flee from the hireling, etc. For although they may be conquered in body, their soul will remain invincible in true confession, ultimately triumphing over that conqueror of theirs. Therefore, what is yours and of similar men of yours, learned and enlightened by the spirit of God, diligently do, that is, oppose your invincible pens as a bronze wall to the most impious efforts of those men. </p>
      <p> For the common people, that is, for me and those like me, who desire not only to seem but also to truly be members of the pious and truly catholic church, it will be to pour out the most ardent prayers day and night to the Father of mercies, that for the sake of his most sweet Son Jesus Christ our Lord, he may avert impending evils from the necks of his own or grant victorious patience over all evils and a steadfast confession of the truth until the very last breath. Amen. I would have added something about my private affairs; but I know you are very busy with these serious thoughts, so I will perhaps reserve it for another time when a more severe storm arises, if at least a crack for escape opens, to discuss them in person. Farewell in Christ Jesus with all yours and the whole church of Zürich happily, and allow me to be commended to your most holy prayers, I beg; I certainly remember you every day. From Worms, 18th of the Kalends of October, in the year etc. 51. </p>
      <p> Yours from the heart and truly from the heart, Wolfgang Waidner. To the most illustrious and learned man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigorous defender and propagator of Christian piety, his most esteemed lord and friend. </p>
      <p> In Zürich. </p>
