      <p>May God grant you His blessing and His spirit for a good year.</p>
      <p>From Italy, I have received the announcement of the continuation of the Council of Trent, issued in Rome on the 18th of November, to continue on the 1st of May. Only those who have the freedom to sit in the council, archbishops, etc., are being summoned. The Pope claims that he has the authority to convene and govern the council, confirming the actions of Paul III in the Council of Trent. Additionally, I have also been sent this, which you see here; keep the printed copy, and send the written one back to me as soon as you can; for I want to send it to Bern, and I do not want to delay.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I have received two copies from below, one from Philipp, Duke of Brunswick's son, the other from Heinrich, the incendiary father; they complain about how a people have risen up in three groups to march, indeed they are strong, well-equipped with artillery and all armaments, they have already crossed the Elbe, have taken the bishoprics of Bremen and Verden up to the house of Rotenburg; all the soldiers from the Netherlands are joining them. Help should be sent to them quickly, etc.</p>
      <p>From Strasbourg, I am informed that this people is strong and has a wild house, that also the East Frisians are against the emperor and the neighbors are against them. I fear a miserable peasant war, or that the Goths and Huns, awakened by God, will give their reward to the ungrateful, shameful world. Oh Lord God, if they are to be struck by the emperor, what scandal it brings; if they are victorious, I fear they will not inquire about any discipline, policy of peace, or institutions. I can expect little good in this recent time, although I know, punishing those who... the house of Ahab of Austria not, yet God will surely find His Jehu. God be with you; let us earnestly pray, for it is time. Given in Zurich, January 2, 1551.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned, worthy, pious, and faithful Mr. Ambrosius Blarer, currently residing in Winterthur, his particularly gracious lord and friend, to his own hands.</p>
      <p>January 2, 1551.</p>
