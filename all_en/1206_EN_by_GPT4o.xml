      <p>Grace and mercy from the Lord. I have persuaded Johannes Pontasella to act as an agent in my business; he will go as far as Basel, where he will satisfy the creditors of the deceased Paul; then, on his return, he will also satisfy Franz in Zürich and will take his daughter with him. But you, for your kindness, should thank him and his wife on my behalf as much as possible, and if the opportunity arises anywhere, I will reciprocate. I also thank you greatly for your diligence and care shown to me in this matter and wish to reciprocate if it could ever be possible. You accuse me of negligence, and not without reason: I am lazy and inept at writing; indeed, from January until now, I have had pain in my eyes, so that I could only write or read what was absolutely necessary. The present courier will inform you more clearly by telling you about our affairs and those of Italy than I could by writing. Farewell. From the court of Rhaetia, on the 9th day of March. I wish all the brothers in Zürich well, along with your entire family.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Johannes Comander.</p>
      <p>Philipp Gallicius has arrived these days, having been made a colleague in the ministry.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Master Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
