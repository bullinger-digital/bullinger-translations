    <p xml:id="regest1">Came to Konstanz on Bucer's advice to prepare a concord on the Lord's Supper. Acknowledge that the people of Z端rich, with their confession [No. 482], which they find very good, were as good as present. Hope that Luther and Melanchthon, to whom Bucer brings it, will also agree, although certain irritable minds today often disdain what is true, but perhaps insufficiently formulated. To appease them, certain expressions, if they are not unbiblical, should be tolerated to promote concord. Bucer, who wishes to complete his concord network and was called to Hessen by [Philipp of] Hesse and Melanchthon three days ago, wanted to travel there [to Kassel] with knowledge of their [Upper German] opinion on Luther's [Lord's Supper] view and the possibilities of an agreement. Discussed for six days and want to decide only after knowing Melanchthon's response from Bucer. Therefore, they want to dissolve the meeting tomorrow and not decide anything without having greeted the people of Z端rich. Testify to growing respect for the people of Z端rich and affirm the sincerity of their desire for unity. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings in the Lord.</p>
      <p>We do not think it should be hidden from you, venerable brothers in the Lord, that in these days, by the advice of our esteemed Bucer, we have come here safely by the grace of God, and that primarily for the purpose of investigating and finally finding in the Lord the long-desired and sought-after means of establishing concord on the sacramental issue. For this purpose, we have especially considered that we need your advice and assistance, and we have awaited your arrival. But through letters, we have received a well-written apology for your absence from our most beloved brothers in Konstanz, especially with your confession sent, through which we have recognized you as present even in your absence. For you have expressed your mind on this matter of establishing concord as clearly in your absence as we have in our presence. And indeed, we could not help but greatly approve of your confession in this matter. If only Luther and Melanchthon, with Bucer delivering it, would approve of it as we cannot disapprove of it with a good conscience! But these are our times, in which it is difficult to satisfy certain ill-disposed minds, who sometimes tend to reject or at least disdain what is truly confessed, yet perhaps not sufficiently professed. If you can address these by allowing certain expressions that do not conflict with Scripture and the views of the orthodox, you should refuse nothing and yield, so that concord in the Lord may proceed, by which, as he said, "small things grow," but great things "fall apart." We speak of concord in the Lord. For we desire and seek no other than that which is from the word of the Lord.</p>
      <p>For this reason, our Bucer, who has long since begun the work of this holy concord, is now striving to complete it, especially with such a good opportunity given by the most pious Prince of Hesse and the peaceful Melanchthon, whose letters called our Bucer to Hesse four days ago, so that, having clarified their intentions, he might come there more informed and certain of everyone's opinion on Luther's view and the possibilities of concord. Therefore, for these six days, we have done this: We have discussed rather than decided, intending to decide only when we have learned from Bucer what Melanchthon will respond to our explanations of Luther's and his followers' concord. And Bucer will bring this response in due time, as he so desires concord to be established that truth is not suppressed. Therefore, we wished, as we are about to depart tomorrow and return to our own by the grace of the Lord, to decide nothing without greeting you, but to simply explain what has been agreed among us, so that by this means we might testify to you our mind, which will not be swayed by any fear or favor to abandon the truth.</p>
      <p>We also testify with these letters that our love and respect for you have certainly not diminished, but have increased greatly, as we see you equally burning with love and zeal for establishing and completing concord as we are, who perhaps seem to be the only ones desiring to meditate on concord. Meanwhile, to some brothers who suspect that we are attempting this either imprudently or impudently, we wish to testify to the Lord and His church and indeed to all good and pious people our intention, which now desires nothing more and earnestly prays to the Lord than "that we may proceed by the same rule to what we have attained, to think the same thing" [Phil 3:16]. "For if we think otherwise," as the apostle said, "God will reveal this also to us" [Phil 3:15].</p>
      <p>Farewell happily in the Lord and continue to be persuaded of us, as you have been, namely, of those who cultivate brotherhood steadfastly and holily in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Konstanz, December 21, 1534.</p>
      <p>From the people of Augsburg, Ulm, Memmingen, Konstanz, Kempten, Isny, Lindau, and Biberach, who was absent but present in writing.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished Leo Jud, Heinrich Bullinger, Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, and the rest who preach Christ in Z端rich with good faith and constancy, venerable lords and brothers.</p>
