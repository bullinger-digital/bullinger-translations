      <p>Greetings. I rejoice when good men are elevated, as you write has happened in your place during these miserable times. May God ensure that this leads to His glory. I have not yet learned anything about the meeting of the Swabian League in Augsburg. However, I hear this about the alliance between the Pope and the French King: It is agreed that the King will eradicate Lutheranism among his people, starting with his sister; if he cannot convert her, he should send her into exile. If he is strong in this pact, the Pope promised to make him Emperor and then create a new King of the Romans. To satisfy the Pope in some way, they say the King soon drowned two brothers and the sister of Farel. The Pope holds this against the Emperor: He promised a council, which he did not deliver, and also promised to subdue Germany, which he never attempted, therefore he cannot act otherwise against him. See, my Bullinger, a council, such as the debate in Baden would have been if Zwingli had attended. A man said all this to some of our leading figures, to whom nothing about the King was previously unknown. Inform me about the weight of the gold, once you have been informed.</p>
      <p>Farewell to you and all the brothers, especially Utinger.</p>
      <p>Basel, in the year 33, in the month of December.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, dearest brother and lord. Zurich.</p>
