      <p> Greetings. I am very sorry that the booklet was not delivered to you, my most esteemed Myconius. Therefore, I am now correcting that mistake and sending two to your piety instead of one. I have received two letters from you and thank you for your diligence; but since there is nothing in them that requires a response, you will not be offended if I do not reply; nor could I due to the lack of time, even if a response were necessary. The Baden Assembly will begin the day after tomorrow; the king will request that several Swiss cohorts be sent, I believe two thousand; he will lead them as a garrison to Piedmont. </p>
      <p> There is silence from the Swabians; I fear they are too compliant with the Emperor. If you have any news from friends, please share it. From Italy, pious and outstanding men write that the churches are growing, despite the devil's madness. Farewell, along with all the pious. </p>
      <p> Zurich, November 20th, on which day 20 years ago I was forced to flee my homeland to Zurich, lest I be slain or burned by the victorious Five Cantons. Glory be to the Lord. 1551. </p>
      <p> Your Bullinger. </p>
      <p> To the most distinguished man, Oswald Myconius, my most esteemed and beloved lord and brother. </p>
      <p> Basel. </p>
