      <p>Greetings, esteemed brothers.</p>
      <p>Due to what you recently wrote about my alleged defection to the Lutherans, I am so occupied with the affairs and troubles of our church, both mine and those of my people - for some very harmful erratic fevers are rampant here, although the Lord has not yet sent them to me, but to my wife and youngest daughter - that I have not been able to reply to your letters. It pains me that you are so indignant with me, who has done nothing other than what I have been doing for four whole years now, and I miss the candor in you, as you did not endure to either plainly look at my letter yourselves or send it as testimony against me to those churches to which you wished to report my name so gravely. Am I so unknown to you? Have I been so frivolous, not to say impious, that you should have imputed such a great fraud to me in the matter of religion? But I will bear everything for the Lord's sake, considering who you are to Christ and the churches, whatever you have shown yourselves to be to me on this occasion. I wish you would recognize those you have as co-workers in the Lord's vineyard even among those who, held in error, do not recognize you. I wish that the more hostile you find them, the more cautiously you would treat them, and that you would not seem to give anything to enmity, but rather charge them with nothing other than what is true, so that you would not attack each other with slanders rather than arguments. But I also wish that I myself would arrange and conduct many things far differently than I do, and I persist in this with myself and with friends. Thus, while you bear with me, I do not renounce the friendship of Christ, seeing the work of the Lord in you. I do the same towards the Lutherans, in whom I require this more than in you, because they first proscribed you and me with you from the kingdom of Christ. I will write to you about everything I have done in this matter, as well as the reasons I have followed in each case. It will then be your judgment. Meanwhile, while you do not truly know the cause, do not judge. But if it pleases you to accuse me before others, set a day, and make it so that I also have a place to defend what is true. It is enough, oh brothers, that there are enemies everywhere. There was no need for us to attack each other in this way. You write about great disturbances among you. Who, I ask, stirred them up? I wrote private letters to you. If they offended, the matter could have been settled between us without disturbing so many churches and yourselves. But I forgive everything. Forgive me too, for I disapproved of your actions, which I do not see as commendable, among you. Let the same right be yours over me. Through me, the friendship of Christ will remain unscathed.</p>
      <p>Farewell, and while it is not pleasing to fight against the Turks, I ask you to help by praying. For unless Christ looks upon us, too much danger threatens Germany. Our 80 horsemen set out yesterday, and five hundred foot soldiers will follow in nine days.</p>
      <p>In Strasbourg, the day before the Ides of August.</p>
      <p>The brothers greet you.</p>
      <p>Your Martin Bucer, if it pleases you, as always.</p>
      <p>To the most pious and learned men, Leo Jud, Heinrich Bullinger, Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, and the remaining brothers in Zurich, esteemed fellow ministers.</p>
