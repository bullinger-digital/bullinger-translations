    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Myconius' letter [No. 3035] requires no response. It is certain that Emperor Charles V will not spare the Swiss Confederates if a good opportunity for attack presents itself to him. The French King Henry II is seeking [in the Confederation] a [new mercenary] alliance and is lamenting the miserable death of the Duke of Piacenza, Pier Luigi Farnese. Bullinger concludes from this that Pope Paul III and Henry II have allied themselves [against the Emperor]. Should the [Protestant regions of the] Confederation ally with France, they would become mercenaries of the Pope, and this, in turn, fills Bullinger with fear and worry! May God stand by His Church! For some see their salvation only in an alliance with France. But Bullinger knows that this would be life-threatening for the [Protestant regions], just as it already is for the allied [Inner Swiss]! God would disapprove of such an alliance and therefore destroy both France and Helvetia.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Myconius should immediately summon Johannes Buchter to him and, in the name of his parents and Bullinger, command him to hasten back to Zurich without delay, for his father Heinrich is on his deathbed. Both the doctors and Bullinger believe that Heinrich's death is imminent. Hopefully, Johannes will arrive in time before the burial! If not, he will at least be able to support his mother [...] with her many children. The dying man has already called out a few times: "Run, my Hans, or you will not find me anymore!" May the Lord strengthen him. He will hardly see the light of the next day. Bullinger hurries back to his bedside.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Greetings, also to Francisco de Enzinas, Johannes Gast, and the other colleagues.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] [P.S.:] Gast should know that Bullinger has not received the edition of the Satires of Persius at all. He asks him for it again!</p>

      <p>S. D. In your letter, esteemed brother, there is nothing that requires a response. It is certain that the Emperor, when he finds a convenient opportunity, will not spare us, and now he has a favorable occasion to attack us. The King of France seeks an alliance. Among other things, he laments that the Prince of Piacenza has perished miserably. From this, I infer that there is an alliance between the Pope and the French King. If we were to join our forces with the French, we would become soldiers of the Pope. I am in great difficulties and anxieties! I pray to the Lord to be with His Church. Some think their affairs will not be safe unless through friendship with the French. I see and know for certain that we will perish through this French alliance, just as our confederates have perished so far. The Lord disapproves of this alliance. He will therefore destroy it along with the ruin and destruction of France and Helvetia. I wish I were a false prophet!</p>

      <p>Immediately summon Johannes Buchter to you. Command him to ascend to Zurich without delay. His father is suffering from a fatal illness. Hopefully, he is not buried before Johannes reaches Zurich! But if he dies (as the doctors certainly predict he will soon die - and I myself have detected signs of death in him), the son will not have returned in vain: For the mother is a widow burdened with many children, having no solace. Therefore, he must be present for his mother. So do not delay, but immediately prepare for the journey! You will seriously tell him this in the name of his parents and mine. The father, in his illness, has cried out once and again: "Run, Hans, or you will not find me anymore!" May the Lord strengthen him in true faith. I am now returning to him. In my opinion, he will not see the light of the next day, but with God, all things are possible.</p>
