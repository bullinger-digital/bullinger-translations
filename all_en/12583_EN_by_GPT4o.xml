    <p xml:id="regest1">Renato gratefully received Bullinger's last letter [not received] and took note of the position of the Zurichers. He does not want to respond to it in order not to bother Bullinger or appear stubborn to him.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- May the Lord grant everyone, especially the servants of His word, a mindset that is receptive to instruction; for wherever one exceeds the [God-given] boundaries, one sins, just as Adam once did. Therefore, everyone should be careful never to advocate views in their sermons or books just because they like them, for such views must also be able to be substantiated in the Book of Life [= in the Bible]. If not, their advocates will only cause problems for their successors. Thus, we are still troubled today by Augustine, Ambrose, Jerome, and Gregory [the Great], even though they have long been dead. We talk and write a lot and imagine that we are benefiting Christianity and posterity in piety and in the fight against the Antichrist. May this indeed be the case! Renato considers this clarification necessary, especially since the writings of the early and even more so those of the later [theologians] continue to cause much harm.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- Bullinger should report what he has learned about the current unrest. The Council of Trent is not making progress. May it completely fail! Friends have reported that a French [correct: an Italian] bishop [Giovanni Tommaso Sanfelice, Bishop of Cava deâ€™ Tirreni] has become physically aggressive against another bishop [Dionysius de Zanettinis, Bishop of Crete], whose nickname is Grechetto.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- Bullinger should forward the letter intended for Celio Secondo [Curione] to Lausanne.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Greetings to all as well as from everyone, especially from Agostino Mainardi, pastor in Chiavenna.</p>

      <p>Camillo Renato sends greetings to Heinrich Bullinger in the Lord.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>I have received your last letter, which was indeed very delightful to me, dear Heinrich, from which I have understood clearly what your opinion is regarding the matter of the Lord's Supper. There is nothing for me to write to you about the same matter repeatedly, lest I seem to you either bothersome or overly stubborn. Meanwhile, we wish and pray to God through our Lord Jesus Christ that He grants everyone, especially the ministers of His word, a mindset sufficient for Christian discipline. For it must always be observed in everyone's mind; do not exceed the limit. Wherever we cross the boundaries or line in any matter, it must be a sin. If Adam, the parent of all men and thus of all evils, had not crossed the line of God's word, we would not be laboring so much in divine matters. Therefore, let us be content and focus our minds so that we do not impose or command anything to the people that pleases us but cannot be found in the Book of Life. For there is a danger that (what is vain and null) in divine matters, we will cause trouble for posterity. Augustine, Ambrose, Jerome, and Gregory are examples, who, though dead, still trouble us. Many of us speak, many write, thinking that we will greatly aid the Christian cause with our voice or writing and leave behind for posterity something from which they can always maintain and nurture their piety and avoid the injury of the Antichrist. May we finally achieve what we most desire, and may it lead to the glory of God, our Father, and our Lord Jesus Christ's triumph. Amen. It is right that I write this, not to deter; from the writings of the ancients, we have received a great wound not yet healed; I omit the more recent ones, whom you know. Enough about these matters.</p>

      <p>We earnestly ask you to inform us of any news, plans, or hopes you have amidst the great turmoil of current events. The Council of the Roman bishops still lingers in Trent; may it, if it pleases God, perish there! But God reveals their spirit, in which they boast of being gathered. For a certain French bishop, during a debate (as friends write to us), treated another bishop, nicknamed Grechetto, a Franciscan, very badly with fists; clearly the work of papist spirits.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>As for the rest, ensure that this letter is delivered to Celio Secondo in Lausanne, and I trust you will do so diligently.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Greet the church in Zurich in the Lord for us. From here, everyone, especially Agostino Mainardi, the minister of the church in Chiavenna, sends greetings to you in the Lord. Farewell.</p>
      <p>15th of August, 1546.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished minister of God's word, Heinrich Bullinger, his brother in the Lord, to be greatly respected. In Zurich.</p>
