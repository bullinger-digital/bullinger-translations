      <p>The episcopal matter greatly distresses me.</p>
      <p>I easily foresee what will happen unless the Lord intervenes in a miraculous way... Do what you are doing, namely, as it pertains to preserving the purity of religion and the tranquility of the republic, as much as can indeed be done... - I hear that Lussy from Lucerne has come and has been able to achieve so much that the Five Cantons have made a pact with the papists, etc.</p>
      <p>It is written from Austria that from the occupied fortress of Erdeth, the Turks have gone to meet 2000 Saxon horsemen sent by the princes to aid Lazarus; he understood that the Turks wanted to prevent the two armies from joining.</p>
      <p>Therefore, Lazarus pursued the Turks with his men and arrived in time, when there was a battle between the horsemen and the Turks; thus, the Turks were surrounded and cut down, and the Lazarites achieved a great victory, but that victory was very bloody.</p>
      <p>You see where everything is heading and what the disturber of all kingdoms seeks: civil war. He wants to avenge his brother, the bloody Müser, under the guise of religion.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 14th of September, 1565.</p>
      <p>Soon I will inform you of joyful news regarding your case.</p>
      <p>If only you would finally write something about the money of my Süleri! I could use it better than anything else, but I must do as I can.</p>
