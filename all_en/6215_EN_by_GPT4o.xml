      <p>When I received the letters sent to me from my homeland, Reverend Sir, I also found letters signed by a brotherly hand and addressed to your name. Therefore, I did not want to fail to add mine to those of my brothers and to inform you, our most loving friend, of the present state of my affairs. Which indeed is quite unfavorable, with both foreign and domestic enemies tormenting us.</p>
      <p>Inside the city, there is fear of pestilence; outside, a raging enemy who spares no effort in plotting the ruin of this city. Therefore, most illustrious man, do not fail to support both me and our brothers with your prayers, which I am confident you have long been doing. I cannot write more to you, most illustrious man, as in such a disturbed state of my affairs, I can send nothing worthy of your eyes and judgment.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again in the Lord, and embrace me, your most observant, with paternal benevolence. Given in Geneva, July 30, 1564.</p>
      <p>Your most esteemed Johannes von Ostrorog. To the Reverend man endowed with singular piety and learning, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most vigilant pastor of the ZÃ¼rich church, to be honored with singular observance as a father in Christ.</p>
