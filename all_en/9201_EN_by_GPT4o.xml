      <p>Greetings. The reason I have not written to your kindness for a long time, most illustrious man and father in Christ, highly esteemed, is mainly because I had either nothing or very little to write. Regarding the publication of the Rapsaceni script, Dr. Martin wrote to me on February 2nd in these words: "There is no need for you to be concerned in the future about printing the Rapsaceni script; for Dr. Grynaeus was with me, and he affirmed that once he returns home, he will diligently ensure that it is printed as soon as possible." This is what he said. However, Dr. Grynaeus himself was with me in recent days and promised his efforts in publishing that script. So that you may see how that script has been translated by me and sprinkled with various notes, behold, I now send you an example of it, which indeed, if you wish, you can keep; I would wish, however, that your kindness would add its refinement to it.</p>
      <p>I have endeavored, as you wished, for brevity and that everything be treated with the utmost care in a foreign idiom, yet most commonly used throughout Germany. I have read the printed speech of Bellieverus, but I have not yet seen the letter of Carpentarius, which you write is most venomous; I would wish, however, that someone would arise to refute the trifles, insults, and slanders of these people. It is written from the court of the Margrave of Baden (which, however, was told to me in confidence by a friend) that those in Cologne who profess pure religion are being expelled from their domain, and the emperor is ordering the people of Strasbourg to restore the main church to the bishop, likewise ordering the people of Hagenau and Weissenburg to receive priests into their provostships, and thus occasions for a new Schmalkaldic War are being sought. These preludes show that what the Rapsaceni script mentions is not in vain. Superintendent Brettanus from the Palatinate, Johannes Frisius, writes to me that it is certain that in the battle in Holland, with the army of Alba engaged, the Prince of Orange emerged victorious, with about 8000 of the enemy slain, and that this slaughter took place on the eve of the Lord's Nativity, the day after which Sylvanus was subjected to capital punishment in the public square of Heidelberg. If these things are true, the Lord has indeed proven true what he says, that he will honor those who honor him. On the last Sunday, a French collection was made in our city and countryside; however, I hear that a rather generous contribution was made despite the great scarcity of all things. I wanted to write these few things so that I would not write nothing for too long.</p>
      <p>Dr. Consul, the doctors, Burgoverus, Peyerus, Holzachius, Beatus Leo, and all the fellow ministers send their greetings to your kindness. You will also greet on behalf of all of us all the doctors and professors of the church and school, and if the most illustrious Dr. Rodolphus Gwalther happens to meet you, you will tell him not to be concerned about the vessel he wrote about; for everything has been excellently taken care of.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Written hastily on February 12th, 1573.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted to your kindness, Johann Konrad Ulmer. To the most illustrious man and exceptional servant of Jesus Christ, Dr. Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of ZÃ¼rich, his lord and father in Christ, highly esteemed.</p>
