    <p xml:id="regest1">Has not yet answered two of Bullinger's letters due to a lack of messengers and work overload in connection with the collection of the Turkish tax; the fact that [in Zurich] prayers are being said for them fills them with joy, and they will do the same. They wish to receive Bibliander's [Quran edition], already possess Bullinger's commentaries on the Gospels of Matthew and John, and are waiting for one on Luke. Death does not frighten them, but they are saddened by the death of Leo Jud. In Prague, the preacher Václav Mitmánek has been arrested, who once stayed in Paris, Zurich, and Basel, is very learned, is interested in the works [of the Zurich theologians], and has frequented Pergener's house; whether he has already been released, he will soon find out. Greetings; the "choir" in Zittau is in decline. [Pergener's letter to Froschauer:] Thanks for the letter of March 24, 1543, and for the list of books printed by him; possesses most of the Latin works except for the new Bible and hopes to still receive the missing ones. During the campaign [of Sultan Suleiman I] in Hungary last year, there was no battle with the troops [of King Ferdinand], but Stuhlweißenburg and Gran were occupied; [Upper Lusatia] is now only separated from the Turks by Moravia and Silesia, and in view of the unsuccessful countermeasures, there is despondency. Apologizes for the summary of two letters; the transmission of letters is difficult. Greetings and a request for intercession.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God the Father and our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>I have received two letters from you, most Christian Bullinger, from which I recognize your kind disposition towards us. You will rightly accuse me of laziness for not having replied for such a long time; my excuse, as much as it can be, is first the rarity of those who would carry letters to Frankfurt, and secondly, somewhat the affairs of this republic. For half a year, I was hindered in collecting the royal money against the Turk; now a new levy is demanded for the Turkish expedition. We are filled with great joy that prayers are being made for us among you; we will do the same.</p>
      <p>We greatly desire the book on the laws and religion of the Turks, which Mr. Bibliander has published. By the grace of God, we have your commentaries on the Gospels of both Matthew and John, and we are also expecting the same for Luke.</p>
      <p>We here, who diligently read your writings, do not fear death so much; for we know that the death of Christians is nothing else but a change from a worse life to a far better one. Therefore, for Christians, to die is nothing else but to leave the world, to go to God, the most merciful Father. We are affected by the death of Leo Jud with sorrow, but not with a pagan, rather a truly Christian sorrow. Because of the most holy Gospel, a certain doctor Václav Mitmánek, a Moravian, has been thrown into very harsh chains in Prague these days. He preached the word of God sincerely in the Bohemian language; Bohemians and Moravians have the same language. This Václav was once in Paris and with you in Zurich, Basel, and other famous places. I have neither seen nor heard of a more learned man in Bohemia. He is also very studious of your editions, very familiar to me, who has often discussed Christian matters with me in these my little rooms. Whether he has been released, I do not know, but I will know shortly.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most pious Heinrich, with Mr. Conrad Pellican, Theodor Bibliander, Megander, Erasmus Fabricius, Gwalter, and all others. The choir of singers among us is cold.</p>
      <p>Given in Zittau, on the third day of March in the year 1544. Oswald Pergener, Onofrius, Celestinus, and others most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>My willing and friendly service beforehand, honorable, highly renowned sir, especially good friend.</p>
      <p>Your letter, given on the 24th of March in Frankfurt in the 43rd year, I have received along with the printed booklet or index of all your printed books, and I thank you most highly for such friendly favor that you all from Zurich bear towards me, a poor man. I have most of the Latin books with me, except for the current new Bible and many others, hoping to receive them as well; for if we did not have your books, we would not know what to read.</p>
      <p>In the land of Hungary, the Turkish emperor was present in person last year, but he did not hold any battle or skirmish with ours, but took two strong, mighty places, namely Stuhlweißenburg and Gran, and fortified and garrisoned them well with Turks and all necessities. God knows what will happen this year. There are still two lands, namely Moravia and Silesia, in the way, otherwise, the Turk would also be our neighbor. All the people are very discouraged, having to give large taxes and levies; it is not accomplished with that, losing from year to year.</p>
      <p>Please do not be annoyed that I have written both letters together; I would gladly write much more to you all, but I am very uncertain about the delivery, must always send the letters to foreign places, do not have time to ride out myself. With this, fare you all well and pray to God, our Lord, for us.</p>
      <p>Given hastily from Zittau, in the margraviate of Upper Lusatia at the Bohemian Mountains, on the third day of March in the year 1544.</p>
      <p>Oswald Pergener, city scribe there.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, highly renowned Mr. Christoph Froschauer, book printer in Zurich, etc., my kind, dear friend, now in Frankfurt am Main. In his absence, to his administrator.</p>
