      <p>Dearest Lord Bullinger, honorable brother. I received your letter written on August 24th; I had also received last year your book "On the Origin of Error and on Councils," as I wrote more extensively in my letters sent to the Frankfurt autumn fair, which I hope you received a few months ago. Now we can only send our letters through Hamburg at both Frankfurt fairs because the routes are closed by Alba; otherwise, nothing would be sweeter to me than to converse with you more often through letters.</p>
      <p>I sincerely congratulate you on your recovery from the summer illness and greatly wish to hear about your well-confirmed health. If at this age you can recover tolerable strength after illness, it seems to give us hope that we can enjoy you for a longer time; for illness is often like a medicine or rather a remedy.</p>
      <p>Our affairs are now, by the grace of God, quite peaceful; but they were very troubled recently. Last summer, there was an attempt to marry Thomas Howard, Duke of Norfolk, to the Queen of Scots; but our queen, offended by this attempt, imprisoned the said duke in the Tower of London on September 11th, where he is still detained. At the beginning of November, two earls, namely Northumberland and Westmorland, raised a rebellion, gathering an army in the counties of York and Durham, to restore the falsely named Catholic religion. They had in their army 1,200 horsemen and four thousand foot soldiers. They thought that an infinite multitude would immediately come to them at the name of the mass, and they expected aid from Alba: they had also planned to free the Queen of Scots from custody; but they were disappointed in all their hopes. For the Queen of Scots, having been discovered in the city of Coventry, which is in the middle of the kingdom, was immediately taken away. Domestic aid was cut off partly by the harshness of winter, partly by the preoccupation of narrow passes. Armed ships were also sent out to prevent external aid. Afterwards, the queen gathered an army of twenty-four thousand horsemen and foot soldiers, whose sight the rebel army did not dare to withstand. Thus, on December 16th, the rebels dismissed their foot soldiers; the horsemen fled to the borders of Scotland, where the majority surrendered, and the rest saved themselves by flight. These two earls fled to Scotland with a hundred of the select. But Northumberland was captured by the regent of Scotland and still remains captive there. Westmorland, however, who is young and of Catilinarian morals, lives among robbers in the deserted places of Scotland. Thus, this rebellion was suppressed without bloodshed within forty days, except that five hundred from that faction of rebels were afterwards punished with capital punishment, and many are still detained in prisons, to be punished similarly. This rebel army had on their banners the five wounds (as they call them), and the image of the cross with this inscription, "In this sign, you will conquer." In all the temples, they held their masses.</p>
      <p>But the Bible, translated into our language, which is found in all our temples, they tore apart or burned.</p>
      <p>They plundered the goods of the Bishop of Durham and all pastors and ministers: however, they killed no one. Mr. Pilkington, the Bishop of Durham, (by God's disposition,) was at that time in London for the sake of recovering his health: otherwise, without a doubt, he would have been in the greatest danger of life. But immediately after our tumults were settled, we received the saddest news from Scotland about the death of the best and most pious prince, James Stuart, the regent of Scotland. For on the 23rd of January, he was pierced through the lower abdomen by a bullet from a hand cannon and expired after two days. When the regent on that day (for thus the murder was committed) was riding in the street of the town of Lithgow, surrounded by his nobles as usual, a traitor from the Hamilton family, having aimed a cannon from a certain window against him, struck him. The parricide, having mounted a swift horse, which he had prepared at the back door of the house, escaped and took refuge in a certain castle. It is indeed to be feared that great changes will follow the death of this great man; but we hear that the nobles and counselors of Scotland, who have given their name to the gospel, with great consensus and constancy, undertake the defense of religion and the republic. We expect more certain news daily. Recently, we heard from Spain that the Moors or Marranos inflicted great damage on the royal army, stripped of its camp. Alba has a fleet prepared, but it is unknown what he is planning. Some think he will send aid to Spain; others suspect he will transport the army to Scotland; nor are there lacking those who think he is planning something against us. Therefore, we send out a well-equipped fleet to observe where he directs his course.</p>
      <p>I write somewhat more extensively about our affairs and those of our neighbors to compensate in some part for the long silence.</p>
      <p>The Lords of Winchester, Norwich, Durham, and Salisbury are all well; likewise, Humphrey, Sampson, and Fox. I communicated your letters to Sampson and Fox the other day, who greet you respectfully.</p>
      <p>Greet your college on my behalf. I pray that you commend me and my ministry to the Lord in your prayers. I pray our heavenly Father to bless you all and your labors, which you endure daily, most abundantly. May the Lord Jesus preserve your piety safe for us and His church for a long time!</p>
      <p>London, February 18, 1569.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to you in the Lord, Edm. London.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger the Elder, most faithful minister of the Church of Zurich, and dearest brother in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
