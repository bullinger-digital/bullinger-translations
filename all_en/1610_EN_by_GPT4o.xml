      <p>Greetings. My expectations have finally been met; for I have received letters from you and copies from Froschauer. I thank you for the efforts you have undertaken on my behalf, and also for your little book, in which you eloquently clear our churches of the charge of heresy. I have distributed the remaining copies as they were addressed, except for the one dedicated to Johann Rudolf von Erlach, which I still have with me due to his absence from the city. Everyone expresses great thanks and asks me to convey this to you on their behalf. I am returning the description of the military preparations in Germany and also thank you for this. I ask that you continue to diligently share everything with us. Everything is silent here now, although there are various rumors here about Schertlin being surrounded by enemies; but this rumor does not deserve belief. The Swiss are very angry with him, calling him nothing but a sacrilegious chalice thief whenever they speak of him, and they are also hostile to us because we allowed him to gather soldiers in our territory.</p>
      <p>They pretended they would refuse aid to the French; but the accursed hunger for gold makes it so that they cannot refuse anything to those who offer money, but instead they prostitute all their honor. The people of Lucerne passed through here the day before yesterday; today they say the people of Uri will come; the people of Zug and some others, two banners, have already arrived; they are passing through Solothurn. The delegates sent to the diet are Consul Negelin and the new treasurer Tilger, who succeeded Haller and came a few days ago from the king's court.</p>
      <p>We expect something new from this diet. Let us diligently pray to the Lord that He does not repay us according to our merits, but protects us in these troubles by His grace and grants us the spirit of strength, wisdom, and peace, through which we may avoid any adversity! The death of Otto, my dearest relative, also gravely afflicts me; I hope it does not portend any evil!</p>
      <p>That Jerome from Geneva has finally begun to cause us trouble as well; he was accused here by the Tonon fleet, in which he serves, of beginning to privately gather his disciples there as well, from which greater disturbances might follow. He was summoned and reprimanded. He also wanted to impose himself on us in many ways; but we dealt with him briefly, wishing to preserve our churches in peace. He labors under a great hatred of Calvin, from which all these things arise. He was attempting to write against him; but this was very prudently forbidden by our senate.</p>
      <p>Nothing was sent to the people of Magdeburg from us, because we had no one who could travel to Frankfurt, nor was it safe to entrust it to others. I hear that the people of Basel have collected a considerable sum; but whether they have sent it, I do not know. This is what I had to respond to your letters; take it in good part and fare well in the Lord.</p>
      <p>My family sends greetings to you and yours. Bern, April 6, 1552. Yours, Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord and esteemed compatriot.</p>
      <p>Zürich.</p>
