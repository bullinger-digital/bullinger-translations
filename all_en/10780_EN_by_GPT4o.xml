    <p xml:id="regest1">Confidentially asks Bullinger for advice: Over the past few years, together with the church elders and in agreement with the authorities, he has excluded eight people from the communion due to their immoral lifestyle. Recently, they readmitted Christian Werli from Uhwiesen, but rejected Ulrich Rubli from Dachsen - who had not improved. When Werli, with the support of Christoph [vom Gr√ºts] and [Hans Wilhelm von Fulach], sought the restoration of political rights from the bailiff [Hans Rudolf Lavater], Rubli also deceitfully obtained a pardon with false witnesses. This action is outrageous because the bailiff was deceived, the rights of the church community were bypassed, the powerful and wealthy Rubli took privileges, and the bailiff assumed ecclesiastical powers. In Laufen, various grievances that Schnyder denounced at the synod have also not been addressed. Fears conflict and therefore asks Bullinger for support. Erasmus [Ritter] reports that the Basel decision has not yet been announced in [Schaffhausen].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace, etc.</p>
      <p>In good, trusted, quiet opinion, dear lord and faithful brother, I write to you about this concern and burden of mine with the desire that you would be willing to advise me in it, so that I may act in such a way that the adversary cannot justly take occasion to accuse me of unrest, as I am then rumored to be.</p>
      <p>And this is the opinion:</p>
      <p>My gracious lords have for years issued a mandate concerning whoring, adultery, and pimping, in which the article concerning the ban of the slanderers is drafted. And from that time until now, eight persons have been found guilty of such slanders of women and men in my parish and have been recognized as deserving of penance before my lords. So now, when the persons were imprisoned in the tower, I have always (consistently) together with the sworn elders as leaders of the common church sent the person upon whom the slanders were found to them and read the sentence of excommunication, as the mandate provides, with a recounting of the committed slanders, by which the church has been publicly scandalized, and earnestly (kindly) admonished to penance and amendment of life; and have not readmitted any without the consent of the elders and the approval of the authorities, unless he had previously improved himself, so that everyone had felt, experienced, and seen the amendment of life, also obedience to the authorities in the imposed penances, as then at times (each time) they are imposed on one. Then when one and another came before me and my elders, seeking reconciliation with the church and participation in the holy sacrament, we have readmitted them with the approval of the authorities in the name of the Lord and as much as concerns temporal goods, according to the content of the mandate, we have not burdened ourselves. Thus, I have conducted the matter for about eight years without danger.</p>
      <p>Now, within the past year, two men, one from Uhwiesen, named Christian Werli, the other Ulrich Rubli from Dachsen, have been imprisoned for whoring and adultery, given penance upon themselves, and (as stated above) excommunicated. Thus, before Martinmas, Christian Werli came and earnestly sought reconciliation with the church and forgiveness of the scandal for God's sake. When inquiry was held, it was found by the sworn elders that he had conducted himself piously and honestly and had faithfully followed the imposed penance. And in this, Ulrich Rubli also came, seeking nothing else than that he be allowed to join the congregation and publicly confess, etc. When his life was inquired about, he had taken no change upon himself at all, but despised the penance and the ban, as he still does. We elders have reported the two cases to my lord of Kyburg and, with his approval, readmitted Werli and let the unrepentant Rubli continue to run. And now, on the recently appeared St. Stephen's Day, again sent to him, Rubli, and admonished him once more that he should live according to the penance, for if he would not be obedient to the secular authorities, he should not think that he would be readmitted to the church like Christian Werli. There it remained at that time.</p>
      <p>Now, as the Bernese matter began, Christian Werli came and requested of me and my elders that we advocate for him to my lord of Kyburg, so that he might be restored to the honor of his day, whatever might happen; for young Christoph and the young lord also want to intercede for him. Therefore, we, moved by the change in his life, have added our petition to the young lords' petition in a letter, asked the young lords for the seal in all our names, and sent it to Werli. Upon this, Ulrich Rubli also brought forth and obtained an intercession, but without my and the elders' favor, knowledge, and will, all as you will hear in the letter, which I also send to you, dear brother, in trust, for it was entrusted to me in trust; read it.</p>
      <p>And I bear the burden of the matter, that there a deception was presented to my lord of Kyburg, that he had kept the penance and lived properly, which is not the case, and it is not at all the case that he had my Joseph Isenschmid drunk at Altenburg on Sunday eight days ago, for which we scolded him in the first weeks. And we are being accused with the untruth, whoever draws us into the matter, we say, he has kept the penance. Secondly, it oppresses me that the authority of my parish church, which I have used without exception as mentioned above, and now treated Christianly in Basel, should be raised up with the deceit of a woman, who should have no voice in the church, and by an unrepentant person with false boasting, all indulgence obtained, as the letter states, regardless of the approval of the pastor and elders, in whose hands is the authority of the church. Thirdly, one feels and sees that the woman and Rubli and all those who deceived the lords have no regard for God, the ban, the power of the church, and the servants of the church; from which it follows that every rich, powerful person who has such a great friendship and following, if he whores, is punished like the others and therefore banned, can help himself from the ban through the means of powerful persons, through intercession like Rubli, where then does the poor go? So the power of the church should be so entirely without regard to the person, that even Ambrose did not regard the defiant Theodosius. Fourthly, even if my lord of Kyburg has forgiven and absolved him everything, by what authority? For whom the church does not absolve, is not absolved; for it is not valid to escape the power of the church with lies, which Christ has given her.</p>
      <p>Oh God, where do we come to, when a handful of malicious people in a parish turn things badly and have some influence, what do they bring about! To this day, no account has been given, neither of donations, anniversaries, and other church goods, nor has the churchyard been bequeathed, nor has it been done according to the statutes, as I have often written in synods. To whom that belongs, I commend to God.</p>
      <p>Therefore, dear, faithful brother, I send you a trusted messenger, asking you for advice, for the matter causes me great conflict. May God grant that I act wisely; then I do not care. I want to let all things remain in trust. It seems to me that the lord wants to end peacefully; reading the handwriting and giving me the letter back to the messenger; for many are concerned with the matter, and all of us.</p>
      <p>Erasmus has recommended to me, the decision from Basel has not yet been announced to them</p>
      <p>May the Lord truly bless us all. Amen.</p>
      <p>Given at Laufen on the day of February in the year 36.</p>
      <p>Peter Schnyder, your willing and faithful brother.</p>
      <p>To my especially dear and trusted lord and brother Master Heinrich Bullinger, in Zurich.</p>
