      <p>S. I received your letter, dated three days ago, today at around eight o'clock.</p>
      <p>Two of our local messengers are still on their way to you, whom we are expecting. Now a third is being sent; for what reason, I do not yet know.</p>
      <p>The matters are serious, and much communication is needed. It is written and said that the forces of Condé are victorious near Paris; the Guise faction has a stronghold in the city, intending to defend themselves there. May God repay them according to their deeds and deliver His believers! In Lyon, a heavy skirmish took place these days; our people wanted to hold a sermon in a house, which the papists wanted to prevent. It came to a battle; up to 18 were killed, among them two German merchants; but I do not yet know where they are from. They were driven away by the governor's guard and barely separated from each other.</p>
      <p>The believers are zealous, willing to risk life and limb. In summary: I see that it will cost much blood unless God provides a good resolution. Tomorrow, Schultheiß Nägeli and Herr Niklaus von Diesbach will ride to Solothurn to speak seriously with the Confederates, to see if the move can be prevented and an embassy sent for peace. It is said that the Guise faction desires peace, giving good words; but Condé will not agree unless the king is restored and full freedom is given to the believers, which they might gladly accept. Recently, a son of a preacher not far from the city was visited. The matter is presented smoothly, as if it were a violent unrest, and the king desires only servants for his bodyguard; otherwise, he wishes to harm no one. But oh, little fox! My lords have everywhere forbidden their people by oath and honor to run away, but to sit still; they also present the matter to them in such a way that I do not think any of ours will join them. There are various concerns about this matter; I do not yet know what will happen. It is found that they would be very eager to march against the resistance; if only they were given leaders, they might trust themselves to manage. Meanwhile, common prayers are made daily for them, and they are remembered in all sermons. May God hear them and us and break the Ahithophelian plans. Amen.</p>
      <p>All good lords and friends greet you. I do not have time to write to my brother; therefore, I wish to communicate this to him. I intend to send the letter to Geneva, God willing, after today.</p>
      <p>Given in Bern, April 25, 1562.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, the hail did not work well here; may God protect the rest!</p>
      <p>J[ohannes] H[aller], your willing servant.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and dearest compatriot. In Zurich.</p>
