      <p>Greetings. Although, reverend father in Christ, I have nothing to write, yet because this young man here, who gives you this letter, Heinrich Schwartzwald, who has been in the service of Vergerius until now, from the lineage and offspring of the WÃ¤denswil family, of singular modesty, earnestly asked me to give him the opportunity to visit you through my letter, I did so all the more willingly because he is traveling directly to Basel, and then also to Bohemia, so that if you had any letters for friends who are on his way, he could conveniently deliver them, or if not, you would kindly dismiss him with a greeting.</p>
      <p>Yesterday I had a long and extensive conversation with Mr. Vergerius.</p>
      <p>He was very much defending himself on the grounds that he had never attempted anything in the name of a sacrament in the Leagues; for he said he found much to be desired in Brentius. However, he said he had worked hard on this matter with his prince, but not with much success, etc. These and many other things, which I would write, if I did not spare the deceased.</p>
      <p>Now I easily understand where everything from Zurich to him has emanated; for he did not keep it secret. Our fairs are now imminent; the brothers are gathering for the synod.</p>
      <p>Therefore, if you have anything from France, do not hesitate to share it. I know your occupations; you will give the task of copying to Collin's relatives.</p>
      <p>But this also seems to be added.</p>
      <p>You know that in the Upper League there are two prominent men, who surpass the others in goodness and understanding, the old Cabalzar, the old Johann Florin from Disentis. They have so far led the cause of the Pope and the Five Cantons in the Upper League; yet this year they have behaved quite amicably in many matters. (But it was Florin who was the author of Beccaria's expulsion.) Recently, they have been together in the Upper League, Cabalzar has become a land judge, and when he came home, he got into a quarrel with his neighbor, who beat him almost to death, knocked out some teeth and tore out his beard, so that it is thought he will no longer be used in the court. But when Captain Florin came home (he is said to have a wife from Uri, whom he is said to have feared before the servant), in a quarrel, he threw a stone at the servant and killed him; the matter is settled, the captain is to give 200 florins to the deceased's relatives and serve 1 year.</p>
      <p>I write this so that you may see how the devil also has his martyrs. In Burgun, the mass priest has left the mass, now preaches to some in a house; because the others keep him from the church. These few things I was allowed to sprinkle here.</p>
      <p>Farewell, reverend father in Christ. 20th May.</p>
      <p>What is happening in Solothurn?</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man with singular learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his always honorable lord and patron.</p>
