    <p xml:id="regest1">Vadian mourns the much younger [Georg] Binder and [Kaspar] Megander, who passed away [on July 18 and August 17, 1545, respectively]. - He has read Bucer's writing [„Von den einigen rechten wegen und mitlen Deutsche nation inn christlicher religion zu vergleichen“, August 1545] and recognizes in it Bucer's accommodating care, who loves the opposing parties and seeks reconciliation, even if he may appear inconsistent in doing so. Vadian cannot imagine malice in Bucer; nor does he doubt that Bucer pursues a very specific goal without losing sight of the [Holy] Scripture. This is also Vadian's stance; however, he does not waver because of it. Rather, he shares the teachings of the Zurichers, but he believes that one must carefully weigh one's words when interpreting the mysteries [of God]. - Bullinger has learned from a reliable friend [Blarer] that Vadian regretted that "his Zurichers treated Luther unjustly." The matter is as follows: Frecht wanted to know Vadian's opinion [about the „Warhaffte Bekanntnuß“]. Vadian replied to him that he had not yet read the book, but he had heard that the Zurichers had treated the meritorious [Luther] very unjustly. This corresponds to the judgment of righteous people from [Vadian's environment], who appreciate the Zurichers but would like to see them show more restraint and less biting in their writings and give up their Helvetic smugness. Vadian does not need to name names here because everyone is free to have their own opinion, and because he can testify to the reliability of his information himself. So he shared the opinion of others with Frecht and not his own, in order to make him more receptive to the rest of his letter. In it, he wanted to make Frecht understand that Luther expresses himself about the mysteries [of God] just as when the [Protestants] speak about the bishop's [office] and confidently refer to the [Holy] Scripture; that Luther is also hostile to the tropical mode of speech, which the entire antiquity acknowledges, and without which the mysteries [of God] could not be interpreted; furthermore, that with the leaven of the Pharisees, which one should beware of [cf. Mt 16, 6-12 par.], not so much the false doctrine of the Papists is meant as the hypocritical, boastful perversity in thinking. This and more Vadian wanted to clarify to Frecht. Unfortunately, Vadian no longer possesses a copy of his letter. He wanted to prove himself to Frecht as a herald of concord and ask him to advocate in writing to Philipp [Melanchthon] that nothing more outrageous should happen. - Meanwhile, none of the demanding spectators have reacted to Luther's [attack]. Yet they enjoy observing the efforts of the [Swiss Protestants] fighting in the arena and even take the liberty to criticize trivialities! - Bullinger should not doubt Vadian. If only this quarrel could be settled and brotherly gentleness lead to unity! - Vadian, however, thanks Bullinger for his reliability and openness, which he did not show him in his admonishing letter.</p>

      <p> I mourn the death of Megander, a most learned man, and this grief has been sharpened by the loss I felt at the passing of our Binder. However, to mitigate everything, there is an unbreakable law that has long since decreed death for all men. These events remind me, as they involve friends much younger than I, to think much about dying and to instill in my mind that what cannot be avoided must be endured by the flesh, but for the spirit, it is to be desired to depart from this world and to be with Christ. I have read Bucer's booklet and observe the man's accommodating concern, which is certainly varied; yet he maintains the manner of those who love the parties and wish to be reconciled. For I can hardly persuade myself that he is either malicious or cunning or of a wavering mind, so that even in this doctrine he does not follow a certain rule of faith and does not have a clear view of what Scripture primarily allows him and to which harbor he should sail; in which I am also of the same mind, not indeed wavering or vacillating (for I approve of your doctrine and judge it to be pious), but so restraining myself that I think it matters greatly what kind of language you use in explaining or teaching the mysteries and what form of expression you follow. As you remind me, you have heard from a friend of unwavering faith, etc., that I am grieved that my Zurichers have treated Luther so unjustly, consider this: Frecht asked me for my opinion and wanted to know my judgment. I replied that I had not yet read the book, but I was grieved to hear that the Zurichers had treated a man of such merit so unjustly, etc. For there are good men among us who love you dearly, who still desire moderation in your style, as it has something of gall and exudes a certain Helvetic smugness, which, if it had been tempered, would have made everything you published far more gracious than it can now be in such suspicion of ill-affected minds, etc. There is no need to name the authors of this judgment, for opinions are free; but I testify by Christ the Savior that the matter is as I write. I indicated this to Frecht, lightly touching on the matter of the Eucharist, and I did not do this as if revealing my own opinion about the booklet, but reporting the judgment of some who feel Luther was treated too harshly. I did this to soften the man's mind, so he would more fairly accept my argument in the rest of the letter; for it seems to me that Dr. Luther wants to speak or continue to speak about the mysteries in the way that Scripture itself most demands we speak and think about bishops; furthermore, he rejects the tropes that all antiquity has recognized and without which a sound explanation of the mysteries cannot stand, etc.; but I fear that, because the apostles were warned by Christ to beware of the leaven of the Pharisees, he too, with the apostles who were both unlearned and devoted to the letter, will understand the Pharisees' leaven as more of the papal bakery than the hypocritical boastful perversity of doctrine; with some other indications, by which I openly hint at what my mind is towards him. And if only there were some example at hand that I could send! You would see the whole matter is as I say; but believe me, affirming with holy faith, it is not otherwise. For I have never shown myself to Frecht in this controversial matter as anything other than a certain herald of concord, so to speak, who confidently promises himself to bring about reconciliation; repeatedly also beseeching the man, through his letters, to ensure through Philipp that nothing more insolent than brotherly charity would bear should be undertaken, and I indicated for what reasons I desire this. Meanwhile, indeed, not even a jot do some delicate spectators reveal of their opinion in writing, nor do they prick Luther even with a woolen thread, delighting exceedingly in the labors of our arena and at the same time peeling off the minutest things to criticize; whom I do not care about. I write you the truth, which is God. Do not doubt me; the matter stands right. Yet my great wish would be that all quarrels might be lifted in this tension and all discord be directed to good unity with brotherly, gentle consideration in this case. But I greatly approve and embrace your faith and openness in admonishing me so freely, as I know that in this way only those who are proven and tested friends are accustomed to do. </p>
