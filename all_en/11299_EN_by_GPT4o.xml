    <p xml:id="regest1">Has unjustly reproached Myconius for his silence. Agrees with his criticism of Emperor [Charles V] and wants to know if [King Henry VIII] was admitted to the [Schmalkaldic] League; hopes for the Emperor's failure and calls for penitent prayer. Regarding [Diethelm] Keller, he is not aware of any letter [from Basel]. Is grateful for everything Myconius does for Rudolf [Gwalther], but would prefer to entrust his accommodation to Gryn√§us. Fears to have bad news soon. Recommends Gwalther, Butler, and Reiffenstein.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>Without merit, I had reproached you in my last letter for your prolonged silence, dearest Myconius. For you have beautifully made up for what I complained was lacking by sending letters in the meantime.</p>
      <p>I have no doubt about the imperial treacheries or betrayals. I pray to the Lord to crush the man who desires blood and war, to the glory of His name. If the Englishman has been admitted to the Christian League, let me know. Our merchants have reported nothing of this. They are concerned with their own affairs. They have no questions or concerns about religion or the dangers threatening the gospel. I hope that the Emperor will always stick to the Pope, and in the end, he will suffocate in it. Although our ingratitude, perversity, ambition, excessive luxury, and unrepentant life constantly terrify me. But "not to us, Lord, but to your name give glory, lest the nations say: Where is their God?" Let us pray this more fervently, I ask, and let us be vigilant, as they are preparing evil for us more vehemently.</p>
      <p>I have not yet received any letter about Keller. I thank you for your diligence. My Rudolf cannot praise your kindness and humanity enough. May the Lord be your reward. You will undoubtedly continue to help him, just as you have been in the place of a parent and guardian. I wish he could be received by Mr. Grynaeus; not because he is not well provided for with you, but because I do not want to burden you impudently or willingly. Grynaeus is less occupied with ecclesiastical matters than you are.</p>
      <p>We have nothing new here. May the Lord ensure that we do not have unfortunate news soon from more than one place.</p>
      <p>Farewell and love me. April 18.</p>
      <p>Love Rudolf, Butler, and Reiffenstein; for they hold you in high esteem. In the year 1539.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger as always.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Lord Oswald Myconius, Antistes of the Basel Church, dearest brother.</p>
