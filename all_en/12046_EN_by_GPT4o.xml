    <p xml:id="regest1">Has repeatedly read Bullinger's letter and his writing ["Antiquissima fides"], whose erudition he admires; the fanatics are deprived of any hope for long-lasting prescriptions, for neither is the dogma of justification by faith new, nor is the doctrine of works entirely old. Just as Augustine counters the Donatists, asking them to show him even one [Pope] from Peter to Anastasius who approves of rebaptism, so should the opponents at least show one Saint or Righteous person of the New and Old Testaments who attained salvation through works and not through faith; for why compare the recent times, in which the doctrine of good works somewhat prevailed, with the many centuries of the Patriarchs and Prophets, who all achieved righteousness through faith! Regarding Cochläus, Bullinger rightly suspected that he would not remain silent, for he has again come forward with the enclosed reply ["Replica brevis"], dedicated to the people of Lucerne, to Bullinger's ["Ad Ioannis Cochlei De canonicae scripturae et catholicae ecclesiae authoritate libellum... responsio"], which is childish and does not deserve a response; yet because he slanders Bullinger concerning the Mass sacrifice, Bullinger should again express in a counter-writing dedicated to [Elector Palatine Ottheinrich] that he will not further engage with Cochläus' prattle. Shares the address formula [of the Elector Palatine] in German and Latin. Intends to thank Bullinger shortly with a reciprocal gift; Lorenz Meyer is translating Sebastian Meyer's writing ["In apocalypsim Iohannis apostoli... commentarius"]; if he has not written so far, it is due to the translation work.</p>

      <p>Greatest greetings.</p>
      <p>Most learned and pious man, I have read and reread both your paper and your letter. All the streams are learned, pious, and entirely golden, and I embrace that passage all the more because it, with remarkable brevity, utterly removes the desire and intention of our fanatics for a longer prescription period; for they are entirely focused on the idea that the doctrine of justification by faith is new and recently born, while the doctrine of works is ancient, even though it is evident that no other reason for antiquity is stronger.</p>
      <p>However, when they begin to consider the matter rightly according to your, most learned Bullinger, demonstration, all their way and effort to prescribe is completely taken away. Just as the divine Aurelius Augustine somewhere challenges the Donatists to show him even one among the many successors from the divine Peter to Anastasius who approved of rebaptism, so we now confidently ask our adversaries to show at least one saint or righteous person, not only from the New Testament but also from the Old, who attained righteousness, sanctification, and salvation through works and not through faith relying on the divine promise. Therefore, what are the recent times, in which the doctrine of works reigned somewhat excessively, compared to the many centuries of the patriarchs and prophets, who all attained righteousness through faith?</p>
      <p>As for Cochläus, you rightly predicted that the rattle of Archytas would not remain silent, for he has again come forward with his usual babbling, a reply intended for your most learned Confutation, and, as I think, to make you more hated, it is inscribed and dedicated to the people of Lucerne. Certainly, all of it is more childish than to deserve a response from you, most learned man, or anyone else. However, because he seems to press you with great confidence about the sacrifice of the Mass, where, most ridiculously, he calls you and your like "thysiomachos" (I believe he meant to say "thysiomachos"), it would be worthwhile for you to prepare a refutation against him with this protestation, that henceforth you will no longer write against the prattle of this Thersites, as Homer writes, the immoderate speaker. And to do it quickly and with the inscription of the name of our most illustrious prince, here is the Cochläus exemplar I send you, which he has again issued against you publicly.</p>
      <p>In German, it is written to the prince: To the illustrious, high-born prince and lord, Lord Otto Heinrich, Count Palatine of the Rhine, Duke in Bavaria, etc., my gracious lord. To the most illustrious prince and lord, Lord Ottheinrich Palatine of the Rhine, Duke of Bavaria, etc., my most clement lord, and if there is any such appendix.</p>
      <p>I do not yet have anything with which to reward your most gracious gift, but I hope to do so shortly. That Laurentius Agricola is very busy translating Sebastian Meyer's Apocalypse into the vernacular language by the prince's order. If he has neglected to write so far, he is hindered by the task of translating.</p>
      <p>Farewell greatly along with all the ministers of the word of God who are with you. Hastily, in Neuburg on the Danube, in the year etc. 44, on the day of Jerome.</p>
      <p>Adam Bartholomäus, minister of the word of God in Neuburg, your fellow worker in the Lord's word.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and at the same time most pious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, announcing Christ to the gathered audience in Zurich in Switzerland. To my singularly esteemed lord and friend.</p>
