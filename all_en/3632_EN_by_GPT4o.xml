      <p>Beware of anything...</p>
      <p>For several months now, I have not received even a whisper from friends, whether from Augsburg or elsewhere, about these new movements in Germany, which I cannot help but wonder about; however, I believe that you have more certain information about them, which I earnestly ask you to share with me. I would write much about our affairs, which are deteriorating more and more.</p>
      <p>[Witenbach], who [will deliver this], has completely disappointed all our [expectations of him; he] does not resemble his father at all, so much so that he cannot be seen as [a true] son of his [father].</p>
      <p>Our [military service] was prohibited with a more severe penalty than before, though not as severe as with you, which, however, seemed unjust to no one with a little sense; but soon that law was again [repealed] by its authors [Witenbach] and [his accomplices]. I am tormented with great mental anguish beyond measure; you will learn other reasons from me. Farewell, my venerable and dearest Bullinger. June 27, 1558.</p>
      <p>Greet your household with the brothers and all friends, whom I ask to strongly support my old age with the help of sacred prayers. Farewell again and again, my soul.</p>
      <p>If you have any certain information, please share it, I beg you. For what monstrosity the Germans themselves might bring forth upon their own Germany, I hope they do not experience it to our great detriment. Yours, Ambrosius Blarer.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, to be observed and cherished in every way.</p>
