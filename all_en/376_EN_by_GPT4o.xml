      <p>S. P. D. We receive or hear nothing that would be of great interest to you, except that we conjecture that the coming spring will bring us more than enough rumors due to the strange efforts of those who use the name of religion to establish their tyranny, so that they may not seem to do and strive for everything for its sake, while they love and seek nothing less than a sound and sincere religion. But fate will find a way. Meanwhile, it is written to some of ours from Mailand that the Emperor's son Philipp has arrived at Genua with a very well-equipped fleet. However, there are many who claim that this story is told to the public, so that nothing may inconvenience his father Karl due to the absence of his son; for they do not believe that a way could be open to him across such a wild and stormy sea at this time, where no other navigation could ever be more dangerous. These things indeed move me little. I desire more ardently that with unanimous counsel those cities of ours, which recently held assemblies in ZÃ¼rich and then in Basel, may adhere as sacredly as possible. The day before, Albert Rosinus, the legate of the Roman pontiff to the Swiss, did something while staying at Antron. There are those who think gold was brought, but for what uses, the Lord knows. I thought it, however, a matter worthy of note, which you should not be ignorant of. He never left the monastery to our people; for we kept watch, if any of his faction could be detected; but our church is wonderfully steadfast by the grace of the Lord, and I do not think there are any in our city whom that belly could easily impose upon with a heap of gold. Therefore, I do not doubt at all that anything was agreed with Antron alone, as with the dearest son of the Antichrist. I am very sorry about that humble relative of mine, about whom you wrote to me, that he proves our faith so coldly, otherwise in all respects upright and full of candor, although I have sensed that very few from that Lyciscan tribe of yours think very candidly about the sound doctrine and discipline of Christ, whom we do not doubt will be overcome by the votes of the good. His wife is of a far more venomous mind, and the maid is most venomous and hostile to the ministers of the word, who curses us with all dire things. I signify these things to you alone with utmost faith, only so that you may sympathize; for to change hearts in this forum, indeed, only the Lord can. However, I trust that my relative will do nothing at all that would inconvenience the majesty of our senate in any part, and to this end, that he may apply himself with a concerned mind, I will be, if not his advisor, certainly his companion and helper, for I love the man greatly for the ingenuous simplicity and integrity of his mind. And these indeed about him.</p>
      <p>Now I beg you to soon cheer me with some joyful news of urban affairs. For I hope that everything is going excellently with them in the Lord, the Savior. Farewell with the lords, colleagues, and all of ours.</p>
      <p>Commend me perpetually to the consuls, and I earnestly beg you to ensure that the letters enclosed from Bologna, recently brought, are delivered to Basel as diligently as possible; for they are written to distinguished and pious men, truly worthy to be delivered in good faith. Farewell again and give my greetings to our Musculus in my name.</p>
      <p>St. Gallen, December 21, 1548. Joachim Vadian.</p>
