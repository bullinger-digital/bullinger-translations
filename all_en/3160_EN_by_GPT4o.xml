      <p>Greetings. There is no need for me to write much about the matter that our people here are bringing forward; you will hear about it from them and it will be recommended by itself; I am sure of it. It was seriously discussed here today; letters have been given to them for the Zürich council. There was another plan, that some envoy from the senatorial order should be added, so that the people of Zürich and other cities (especially those of Basel and Schaffhausen, who are confederates of this war and defend it with arms taken up) could see how much this matter is of concern to our people.</p>
      <p>Our people indicate what seems right to them; if others provide better advice, they will yield their own and embrace another. These few words, so that I send you something through them; you will learn the rest from them. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, April 23, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, his most esteemed and dear lord and compatriot.</p>
