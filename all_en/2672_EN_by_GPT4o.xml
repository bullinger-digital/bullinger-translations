      <p>S. D. I am very concerned about your journey; I am at a loss and do not know what to do. I hear that serious wars are flaring up again in Saxony. Therefore, it will neither be safe to travel there nor safe enough to live there. I am completely ignorant of what to hope for from the fruits of your studies. If you hear anything certain about this matter, please inform me promptly. I would also like to understand from you what is being discussed and who the professors are teaching at the University of Marburg. Therefore, make sure I am not ignorant of this, and see to it that you do not write to me about these matters after the festival. I had requested a treatise on Divination, but I have seen nothing of it, so I can only attribute this fault to your negligence. I had also ordered you to record the total of your expenses from the last calculation for me; but I have seen nothing of this. I have already spent, during the entire time you have been away, one hundred and seventy-seven Zurich pounds on your behalf, not counting the books and clothes with which I equipped you when you left. I only account for the money; for on July 10,</p>
      <p>I paid thirty German gold coins to Sebastian Guldibek on your behalf, at the order of Mr. Burcher. See to it that you respond to such great expenses with diligence and proper learning; for then I will have gladly spent, otherwise, you will find me different than you think.</p>
      <p>You excuse yourself and your companions with words; I require deeds and correction, I care nothing for words. I know, and indeed I know for certain, that those who provided me with the subject matter for writing have indicated nothing to me out of hatred or peevishness, have fabricated nothing, have exaggerated nothing beyond measure. They love you and sincerely wish you well. They know more about your affairs than you think. Therefore, what I recently ordered, I repeat: I want you not to leave the house of your host without his knowledge and consent. In the meantime, I do not want you to be confined as if in a prison; go out to sacred sermons, to lectures, and other necessary matters. Spend the remaining time on reading, reviewing lectures, practicing writing by translating authors, writing letters, speeches, dialogues, etc. Consider anything not spent on these as lost. It will be enough if you go to your companions once or twice a week and spend one, two, or three hours with them.</p>
      <p>Literary conversations are often used as a pretext, but one engages in revelry and other things, etc. What I say to you, I say especially and primarily to you, then I want the same said to others, whom you will greet from me. Time is short; you will soon be recalled. I cannot sustain such great expenses. Johannes Rodolphus will also travel abroad; Christophorus is currently staying with the baker. I sustain all these at great expense. I also pay a good pension for my daughters every year. Household economy and expenses grow daily with the increasing number of poor and exiles. Therefore, I am compelled not to support you among foreigners for long. See to it, then, that you use the time granted to you well.</p>
      <p>Mr. Collinus is already recalling both his sons; for he is unable to bear the expenses. This also happens to other pious men, especially those burdened with a large number of children, among whom I am not the least, as a parent of eight children. Behave yourself and keep quiet, modest, inexpensive, and diligent. Thus you will always have a kind parent. All of ours greet you. Farewell always. Zurich, July 16, 1555. Greet your professors and teachers, to whom I could not write; greet all your friends.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, my beloved son, staying with Mr. Burcher in Strasbourg.</p>
