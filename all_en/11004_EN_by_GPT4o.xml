    <p xml:id="regest1">Cannot readily follow the call to Zurich, as he has taken on a teaching obligation in Basel after his return from France in order to pay off his debts; asks Bullinger to first ensure that he is honorably released, which will hardly be possible in the short term, and has written to the [Zurich] council in the same sense on the advice of Grynaeus and Myconius. Konrad [Gessner] would have needed such a call more. Will write about Melchior [Wirz] another time. Asks to show the letter to Pellikan.</p>

      <p>Although I never doubted that you still hold the same regard for me in my absence as you have often shown me, I could not help but be greatly pleased when you conveyed the same to me in your letter, my most beloved patron of all. From which I also fully understood your and the council's opinion of me, to which I will respond with these few words. You know, my most learned Bullinger, that I have often discussed my affairs with you after my return from France and have frequently used your advice on how I might appease my creditors and bring them to peace. No other way could be found more conveniently than for me to undertake the journey back to Basel, from where I departed, and to take up the teaching position both publicly and privately, which you know, at Grynaeus' as if with open arms, as they say, since I was deprived of the support of our college. However, Grynaeus, delighted by my return, offered this to me of his own accord. I accepted and pledged my loyalty to him and the entire gymnasium for some period of time. Therefore, when I am recalled to my homeland by public consensus and clear letters, who but a madman would judge it disgraceful for me not to respond to such an honorable call? But with what face or what audacity could I dare to renounce the University of Basel, which now uses my services and could not so suddenly do without them unless they find another to replace me, I plainly do not know. There is a great shortage of teachers among them and almost everywhere; although you may easily find a large number of learned men, not all are so suitable and fit for teaching. Therefore, my Bullinger, I ask you to deliberate on this matter and to excuse me diligently to Grynaeus, so that I may not seem to incur the fault of ingratitude. As soon as this is done and he grants us permission to depart, I will fly to you as swiftly as possible on Pegasus' wings. I wrote to the council in almost this manner, and I did so not on my own, but at the command of our Grynaeus and Myconius. But lest anything be hidden from you, I wanted to send you this, as they call it, copy. I would not have been displeased if this condition had been offered to our Konrad; for he would have needed it more, to whom I also favor more than myself. But since I understand that it has been achieved by your diligence and the council's decision, I will gladly obey your command as soon as you and the council find a way for it to be done honorably.</p>
      <p>About our Melchior another time.</p>
      <p>I wanted to briefly communicate this to you as the highest patron of scholars. Please consider it kindly according to your humanity. If I have erred in this, consider it done out of imprudence, not deceit.</p>
      <p>I ask, if it is not too much trouble, that you show this letter, which I have just written, to my Pellikan to read.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my most learned and excellent patron.</p>
      <p>Given hastily, on the Nones of March 1537.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Fries, ever ready to obey in all things.</p>
