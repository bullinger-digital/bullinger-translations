      <p>Greetings. If only our Berchtold could write to you as extensively and diligently as he ardently wishes! You would already have a long and friendly letter from him. But his situation is such that he seems neither able to write nor read anything further, unless the Lord, with a mighty hand, miraculously rescues this excellent man from his sufferings. I would describe his illness to you, if I did not know that Megander will do so graphically. I ask you this one thing, to raise our most sincere friend with true consolation in the Lord, as he will admit no one's writings and admonitions more readily than yours, and to pray to the Lord, that He, who has tested and proven him with many calamities in this course of life, may now support and preserve him with His grace as he hastens to the finish line. Indeed, I believe you can imagine how much grief I draw from this man's illness, as I stand almost continuously as a spectator of my dearest father's torment, although I grieve not so much for him or myself as for the whole country, which is losing a father, not a teacher, especially in these times when the Lord seemed to be raising the minds of all through him alone. But grief will not be welcome even when it may be necessary, so I leave you to your affairs, having set aside a longer lamentation, praying to the Lord alone, who may wish to keep you and those like you, the leaders of the evangelical fleet, safe for a long time.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my patron Bullinger, and kindly consider this writing, poured out with a very troubled mind.</p>
      <p>Bern, January 28, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant evangelist of the Church of Zurich, his patron.</p>
