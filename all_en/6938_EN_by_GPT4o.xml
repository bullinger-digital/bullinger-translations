      <p> Greetings. I wrote to you yesterday through someone else, honorable father. But because I think this one will arrive before the other, I did not want to neglect this opportunity to write to you as well. I believe this is being sent regarding the Subsylvanian matter. They have responded to our people. What that is, you will understand more accurately from what is written by the magistrate. It was not out of any contempt that nothing has been written so far; they thought it sufficient that I had written everything to you, and they had not yet received a response from them. However, what has happened to me privately in the meantime, both here and in Lausanne, you will learn from yesterday's letters, as well as from those I wrote to my brother. Two of my little daughters have died, one here, the other in Lausanne, on the same day and almost at the same hour. Blasius is in great distress because of the impious custom of that people, who close houses infected with the plague for 6 weeks, so that no one is allowed to leave. But we must bear this common fate with others. The Lord has spared us for a long time; now he finally visits us too, so that it does not seem as if he has completely neglected us; blessed be his name! Pray to God for us, and if it pleases the Lord to call us from here as well, commend my family to you. Yesterday, the wife of the younger Ludwig Zehender, a most honorable young woman, whom he had for barely a year, passed away. The elder greets you. I also think Steiger will write. Farewell with all your family. </p>
      <p> Bern, November 22, 1566. </p>
      <p> Johannes Haller, most devoted to you. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my lord and most esteemed compatriot. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in ZÃ¼rich. </p>
