    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller is waiting for the response from Bullinger and the Zurich council to his letters [including No. 2962], which he entrusted to Thoman Ruman. He hopes that the people of Zurich are concerned about his well-being and will call him back. Then he will be able to tell many things that he cannot communicate in writing.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Here is just one thing: The almighty Emperor Charles V entered Augsburg with a solemn triumphal procession on July 23. Haller does not regret having seen this spectacle. The procession consisted of more than 4000 landsknechts and about 1500 cavalrymen. The army, composed of Spaniards and Italians, the Emperor left on the Danube, and the captured Electors Johann Friedrich of Saxony and Landgrave Philip of Hesse in Donauwörth. The Elector is still expected in Augsburg today. The Spaniards are well-disposed towards him, while they (just like the people of Augsburg) despise the Landgrave. They believe that he is not quite in his right mind. The Emperor is said to have held Duke Maurice of Saxony captive for three days because Duke Heinrich the Younger of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel accused him of having orchestrated his capture by cunning in [1545]. Maurice is said to be free again, and Duke Heinrich has regained his territory.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Haller cannot report on the events in Augsburg and about his [new] neighbors. He wishes to be released!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Nikolaus Müller known as Maier, Wolfgang Musculus, Sixt Birck, and Georg Frölich send their regards. Bullinger's last letter to Frölich [not received] was very timely! Greetings to all colleagues.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The enclosed letter, which Ruman forgot in Augsburg, is intended for the boy [...] whom Haller recently sent to Johannes Wolf. Hopefully, Ruman has reached Zurich safely. The roads are now unsafe, as the Emperor today dismissed all the mercenaries who occupied Augsburg for almost half a year. Among them are many Alsatians and Sundgauers. Haller is sending his letter with the Zurich mercenary M., who is also returning. But enough! Haller does not want to start a new letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings from God the Father through our Savior Jesus Christ, etc. I am awaiting your and the Zurich council's response to my letters, which I recently sent through Thoman Ruman, and I hope that you have not entirely abandoned concern for my well-being and will call me back. Then, I will be able to tell you many things in person, indeed countless things, which I cannot write now, nor would it be safe to do so even if I could as I wish.</p>

      <p>I write only this one thing: The almighty Emperor Charles V entered the city on July 23 with a solemn triumphal procession (which I do not regret having seen) with more than 4000 German foot soldiers and about 1500 cavalrymen. He left the Spanish and Italian army on the banks of the Danube. He left the captured Elector and Landgrave in Donauwörth, and we expect the former today as well. The Spaniards are all well-disposed towards the Elector. Both our people and the Spaniards detest the Landgrave. They say he is almost out of his mind. The Emperor also detained Maurice for three days (as they say) because Duke Heinrich the Younger of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel complained to the Emperor that he had been captured by Maurice's cunning; but they say Maurice has been released again. Duke Heinrich has also been released to reclaim his dominion and duchy.</p>

      <p>It is not safe to write about what is happening here or what kind of guests we have. I wish to be freed!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Farewell. Mayerus, Musculus, Xystus, and Mr. Laetus, to whom you wrote very timely recently, send their greetings. I wish all the brothers with you well.</p>

    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Hand over these enclosed letters to your boy, whom I recently sent to Johannes Wolf. Ruman left them here, whom I hope has escaped safely. The journey is now somewhat unsafe because the soldiers who have held our city for almost half a year have been dismissed by the Emperor today. Most of them are Alsatians and Sundgauers. There is also a Zurich soldier here, through whom I am sending this, as he will return to his homeland. But let this suffice for now, lest I begin a new letter after the previous "farewell".</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Farewell again. Augsburg, on the feast of St. James 1547. You know my hand.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my lord, to be honored as a father. M. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
