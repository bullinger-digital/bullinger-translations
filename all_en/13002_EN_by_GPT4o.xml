    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller reported a few days ago only briefly due to lack of time [with No. 2942 and No. 2950]. But even though he now has more leisure, he cannot write everything he would like to. Meanwhile, Bullinger's letter [not received] arrived. Surprisingly, it contained no news at all! However, there is much talk in Augsburg about a discord among the Confederates, and everyone predicts bad things for them: Emperor Charles V plans to wage war on them as soon as he reconciles with the imperial estates at the announced Diet and revives the Swabian League. Negotiations on the latter point have already begun in Ulm, in the presence of Augsburg envoys. These have since returned, as further negotiations on the reestablishment of this league are to take place at the Diet convened in Augsburg. Haller could not find out what conditions the Emperor has imposed on the Hanseatic cities. It is certain that they have not surrendered. Presumably, the Emperor did not want to waste time on their subjugation. Reconciliation with the other estates is more important to him, so as not to leave Germany with unfinished business if he were attacked by other enemies. Later, he will probably force the Hanseatic cities to their knees with the imperial ban. That is what Haller has heard.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] It is also reported that Landgrave Philip of Hesse came to the Emperor with the captured Duke Henry of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel, performed the act of submission, and then went to dine with Fernando Álvarez de Toledo, the Duke of Alba, and his father-in-law, Elector Maurice of Saxony. However, when he wanted to leave the dining room, he was arrested on the Emperor's orders. So, two prisoners are being brought to Augsburg! However, many believe that the imprisonment of the Landgrave is just a staging. It is certain that the imperial marshal [Wolfgang von Pappenheim], who assigns accommodations for the princes in Augsburg, has chosen a suitable quarter for Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony and said that the Elector is esteemed in the imperial entourage, which the latter also confirmed in a letter to Jakob Herbrot. But when the marshal was asked what assignment he had regarding the Landgrave, he gave no answer!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Today, at nine o'clock in the morning, Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of Granvelle, arrived. He is now Haller's neighbor. Almost opposite Haller's residence, the Spaniard Pedro de Malvenda (who orchestrated the murder of Juan Diaz by his brother [Alfonso] in Neuburg an der Donau) is to be accommodated. In the buildings of the St. Anna Monastery, 40 horsemen will be quartered. Haller will thus have to come and go with his family right among these people! The Augsburg councilors, who promised so much, no longer dare to make a peep. The pastors are incredibly attacked in public, and the imperial colonel Bernhard von Schaumburg is plotting intrigues against Haller. Only God can help now, as no salvation is to be expected from people. Haller feels like the quarrelsome woman whom no one believed was doing poorly until she died! Only now does he understand the Psalter and the feelings expressed in it. He constantly repeats with the psalmist: "The Lord is my light, my salvation, and my strength. Whom shall I fear?"</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] The number of churchgoers is decreasing because many (who take offense at the cross) are ashamed of the Gospel, and others stay at home to protect their relatives from possible acts of violence. The council demands sermons that do not cause offense. However, the pastors want to prove themselves as worthy servants of Christ: giving no reason for slander and yet confessing the truth freely within the permitted framework. They exhort people to perseverance, solidarity, and trust in God, set an example for them, and are prepared for anything.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] Haller could hardly keep Thoman Ruman in Augsburg, even though he is in less danger than Haller. Everyone condemns Haller and the pastor Johann Flinner, whom they call a loudmouth, and they slander Haller as a cunning hypocrite who seduces the people more through cunning and simplicity than through daring. Some colleagues demand Haller's removal, especially since the Emperor cannot stand Zwinglians at all. Problems are likely to arise. But Haller will triumph through faith in God! The people of Zurich should pray for the Augsburg pastors.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] Bullinger should forgive Haller's confusion. Haller does not know when he will be able to write again, as it is very risky. Many people are put in danger because of it. For the Emperor has uncovered all the secrets of the Elector of Saxony and the Landgrave. So, if Haller writes less often, it is solely for this reason!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] Greetings. If Bullinger cannot or does not want to help otherwise, he and the people of Zurich should pray for the tempted Haller. Nikolaus Müller known as Maier sends his regards. Georg Frölich writes himself [with No. 2952].</p>

      <p>S. P. I wrote a few days ago somewhat briefly because there was no time for a longer letter. Now I have time, but I am not allowed to write everything I would like! Meanwhile, your letters arrived, in which I expected some news, but there was none - which surprises me greatly. There is much rumor here about a new discord among the Swiss, and everyone predicts bad things for them. Good men firmly assert that they too should be attacked by the Emperor. But first, he will reconcile with the imperial estates at the announced Diet and renew the Swabian League; this has already begun in Ulm, where our city's envoys were also present. But since the Diet is convened here, our envoys have returned, for all that business will be completed here. By what means or conditions he left the maritime cities is uncertain. I could not discover the truth. However, it is certain that they have not surrendered. Some affirm that he did not want to waste time conquering them, as it is more in his interest to reconcile with the other imperial estates, lest he be forced to leave Germany in a state of dissolution if attacked by other enemies; he will eventually conquer them with the imperial ban. This is what has reached our ears.</p>

      <p>About the Landgrave, we have heard this: that he came to the Emperor with his captive Duke of Brunswick and, having thrown himself to the ground, submitted himself. Afterwards, he dined with the Duke of Alba and Maurice, his son-in-law, and when he wanted to leave the banquet, he was captured by the Emperor's order. Thus, both captives are being brought. Many believe that the Landgrave's imprisonment is merely a pretext. It is certain that the Emperor's marshal, who is also here and assigns accommodations to the princes, has been instructed to select a pleasant and proper place for the Elector (which he did) and testifies that the Elector is revered by the entire imperial family; this the Elector himself also testified in letters to our Herbrot. However, when the marshal was asked what instructions he had regarding the Landgrave, he did not respond with a word.</p>

      <p>Today at 9 o'clock in the morning, Granvelle came, my neighbor. I will also have almost opposite my residence that Spaniard Malvenda, who betrayed Juan Diaz, killed by his brother in Neuburg. In our St. Anne's College, we will have 40 horsemen, whom, even if I am not forced to have in my residence, I will still have to pass through and interact with my family among them! The lords promised much, but now they do not dare to even whisper. The insults we suffer in the streets are now unspeakable! Our captain is plotting against me more than others. But what can I do? I trust in the Lord. I see that no salvation is to be expected from men anymore. It will happen to me as to the quarrelsome woman, whom no one believed was doing poorly until she died. I never understood the Psalter as I do today, when I am clothed with the same feelings. Therefore, I have no comfort other than to frequently repeat: "The Lord is my light and my salvation! Whom shall I fear? The Lord is the strength of my life! Of whom shall I be afraid?"</p>

      <p>The audience is now beginning to be sparse, partly because many are ashamed of the Gospel (who are offended by the cross), and partly because other pious people stay at home to prevent any violence against their own. The magistrates want us to preach in such a way that we do not offend anyone. We want to do what befits Christ's ministers, giving no occasion for slander as much as possible, but still professing the truth with a free mouth, as long as we are allowed. We exhort the people to constancy, concord, and firm trust in the Lord's help, whose trust we exhibit to them as examples, prepared to expect any outcome with them (unless the Lord intervenes).</p>

      <p>I barely retained Romanus with all my might, even though he is not in as much danger as I am. Everyone condemns me and Flinner, one of the fellow ministers. They call him a loudmouth, and me a cunning hypocrite, who seduces the people more by art and simplicity than by boldness. There are even some among us who, given the circumstances, would like me removed: for the Emperor cannot tolerate these Zwinglians at all. From all this, I gather that I will have much trouble in the future. But in all these things, I will overcome because of Him who loved us; and this will be our victory: Our faith! May the Lord be with our efforts! Pray diligently for us.</p>

      <p>I wrote this with a mind, as you can guess, very distracted. I therefore ask you to consider it kindly. I do not know when I will be able to write more, for it is now not safe to write, and there is no greater danger to be feared from anything. Thus, many good men will also come into danger today, as the Emperor has uncovered and discovered all the secrets of the Elector and the Landgrave. So, if I write less often, know that this is the only reason.</p>

      <p>In the meantime, farewell and help me now overwhelmed by various temptations with faithful prayers, if you do not want or cannot help in another way. Augsburg, July 15, 1547. Greet all the pious. Meyer sends his regards. He writes back himself. Yours forever, whom you know.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Bullinger, his lord and venerable father. Zürich. Master Heinrich Bullinger at the Great Minster.</p>
