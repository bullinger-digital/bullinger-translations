      <p>Greetings. The bearers of this letter, most illustrious man, are two outstanding friends of your church. The elder of the two, who has been tried by many afflictions and a long exile, is Gerhard Westerburg, a man known to the learned and pious. He is traveling to you to discuss various church matters with you and the other brothers. The other is a young Pole of great promise, who wishes to devote himself to Hebrew studies with you and desires to be recommended to you. If you treat both of them kindly, in your singular humanity, you will have done something worthy of your excellent character and pleasing to them.</p>
      <p>As for myself, I did not want to neglect this opportunity to write to you, as I greatly wish you to consider my devotion to you favorably.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most excellent man, with all the ministers of the Zurich church, for whom I pray all glorious things in Christ. July 18.</p>
      <p>Your Martin Borrhaus.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man in piety and learning, Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and brother in Christ, to be respected.</p>
