      <p>Greetings in the Lord. Our younger princes have already set out for Strasbourg for the sake of studies and piety, along with those, one of whom will secretly deliver my letters to you. From which indeed great benefit will eventually return to the church of Christ, provided they are cultivated and imbued in true piety. Therefore, you will undoubtedly have done a worthy deed if you visit them from time to time with your letters, exhorting and confirming them in the Lord. Furthermore, I ask you in the name of this entire church, from which not a little benefit can accrue to the universal church, that you write letters in the name of your church to our prince, in which you express your joy over the refuge granted here by her to the brothers and also admonish her to continue with the step she has taken, as those who gather here for the sake of religion.</p>
      <p>For the devil does not cease to hinder such a pious endeavor in every way. However, there is no reason for her to fear here, since she does it by God's command, who alone is powerful to preserve the kingdoms he bestows. You will also admonish her to completely abolish the monasteries, where here by saying mass and impudently babbling against the truth of the gospel from the pulpit, the name of God is too unworthily slandered and the merit of Christ the Lord is utterly trampled upon, which indeed cannot be retained without the most grievous sorrow of the pious and the intolerable offense of sinners. You will also need to admonish her to remove altars, images, and such things from the temples, which are in no way to be tolerated by a Christian prince.</p>
      <p>Finally, the order of presbyters for governing the church, which has not begun here entirely unsuccessfully, but is somewhat attacked by the cunning of Satan, must be commended to her, since it is certain that it is absolutely necessary for the governance and preservation of the church. You can also admonish Peter Medmann, our prince's advisor, about all these things, who, as I believe, is now setting out to you along with the one who will deliver these letters to you, so that he may promote these very things with the prince by his counsel. Meanwhile, do not give him any indication of our letters to you or yours back to us or to our prince, lest anything here detract from the authority of your letters; but secretly, with Medmann removed, entrust your letters to us to this letter-bearer, and you can include the letters to the princes, written in the name of your entire church, in your letters to me, if it seems appropriate. We have also written to Mr. Calvin and Mr. Martyr, asking them to request the same from our prince with their letters, and I hope they will not do so reluctantly, nor do we doubt, given your piety, that you will do the same and all the more willingly if you consider well how important it is for your church and the entire church to have a church here that agrees with you and stands firm in its strength according to the will of Christ the Lord and apostolic purity. For indeed, he has so many adversaries everywhere and all around, even among those who boast of being the main pillars of the church, that he can hardly have more; may the Lord God have mercy on him and indeed on his church. Farewell, most distinguished man, in the Lord, to whom I commend your health from the heart. Greet for me, please, Mr. Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, Zwingli, and Wolf in the Lord. Mr. a Lasco and Martin Micronius greet you. Farewell again. Furthermore, you can entrust the letters to the prince to Mr. Medmann, if it seems appropriate, provided no word about our letters to you. Emden, March 27, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours as his, Johannes Utenhove.</p>
      <p>Johannes a Lasco, by my own hand.</p>
      <p>Martin Micronius.</p>
