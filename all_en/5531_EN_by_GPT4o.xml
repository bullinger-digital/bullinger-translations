      <p>Greetings. From the letters of my relative Collinus, reverend father in Christ, I have learned that you are not in good health and therefore have not written anything about the affairs of France, although you would have much to say. However, he also added that he is hopeful about your health; I therefore pray to the Lord that He may restore you to the church as soon as possible. I have nothing of great importance to inform you, but I write to continue my custom and to testify to my goodwill and respect towards you. Unless perhaps you wish to know that someone, who was coming directly from Frankfurt, affirmed here that the Bishop of Cologne has passed away and that his death has somewhat impeded proceedings. Maximilian, the son, along with his father the Emperor, attends papal ceremonies and indeed shows great devotion. Those who recently came to us from the market in Ilanz said that the people of Uri (since these people have many mutual dealings due to their proximity) are in great mourning because the disaster of the Guises was announced there. But in the meantime, I hear that several of them, including two captains, have perished from the plague, and not a few have died in the siege of Rouen, and I think this is a truer cause of mourning than the fact that Guise was slain. Please, reverend father, if you have anything, as I hear you do, give the task of copying to Collinus and share it with us. Farewell with all your family as happily and for as long as possible.</p>
      <p>Chur, December 7, 1562.</p>
      <p>Your Fabricius.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed man, Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and always to be honored father in Christ.</p>
