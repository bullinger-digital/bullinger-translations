      <p>Greetings. Due to various pressing matters, I was unable to respond until 8 days after I received your rather lengthy letter concerning the Graubünden affair.</p>
      <p>I therefore instructed our Lucius to inform you that your letters have been delivered to me, and also that those you entrusted to Gessner have been taken care of by me; I sent them to Basel to Mr. Zwinger.</p>
      <p>Although he has not responded, I hope he has fulfilled his duty.</p>
      <p>We eagerly await you, brother. But listen to my concern: You know that the minds of our adversaries are cunning and deceitful, and ultimately malicious. What if that adversary of yours in Graubünden were to denounce you to the Swiss, through whose territory you must pass, and they, with fabricated charges, as they easily invent, were to intercept you?</p>
      <p>I hope for better things, but out of love and concern for you, I cannot conceal my perhaps unfounded thoughts from you in this matter, so that you may be more cautious on your journey. I defer all other matters to your arrival. Perhaps after eight days, a more substantial topic for writing will present itself to me.</p>
      <p>Farewell excellently. May the Lord protect you from all evil. Greet Mr. Campell, the consuls, Gregor, Pontisella, Bonet, Mr. Ruinella, and all acquaintances and good people.</p>
      <p>Zurich, January 18, 1572.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man and faithful minister of the Church of Christ among the people of Chur, Mr. Tobias Egli, my honorable lord and dearest brother. Chur.</p>
