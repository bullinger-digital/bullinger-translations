      <p>Grace and peace from God through Jesus Christ, our Lord.</p>
      <p>I am sending you here, dear Thomas, from our library 4 booklets of Sedulius's "Divine Miracles," an ancient manuscript, and, as far as I know, not yet printed; so that you may also endeavor to obtain another copy if you print it. However, whether this happens or not, it is my desire that you always return the old copy to me.</p>
      <p>Therefore, it is my earnest request that you help me with the following books and, as soon as you can, keep them well preserved, and when a suitable opportunity or messenger comes your way, send them to me and indicate what they, along with the letter collection, cost:</p>
      <p>"Novellae Constitutiones" of Lord Justinian, etc., printed in Nuremberg.</p>
      <p>"Codex Theodosianus," 16 books, printed in Basel.</p>
      <p>If I can then repay and earn such a service for you, I would not hesitate. Also, let me know what new publications are available that you are printing. Be entrusted to God.</p>
      <p>Given in Zurich, June 13, 1536.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the pious and faithful Thomas Platter, printer in Basel, his dear and good friend.</p>
