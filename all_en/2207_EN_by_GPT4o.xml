      <p>Greetings. I fear that the letters I sent to your kindness the day after Bartholomew's Day in the year 1553, most honorable men, have been intercepted, not because anything of great importance was lost in them, but lest they bring danger upon me. For friends from Frankfurt wrote back that the vessel, in which the Delphic cloth was, arrived later than was expedient after the fair; but regarding the letters, which I sent from Hamburg to Antwerp (since at that time travelers were in danger among us) and then arranged to be delivered to Frankfurt, they indicated absolutely nothing; therefore, I now send them again, which were as follows: "I do not think you are unaware" etc. - "commend to the Lord" (August 25, 1553). As for the fact that in the previous letters I was not sufficiently circumspect in advising the dedication of your works, I beg pardon, having experienced the contrary in the now exiled English church, and how true is that saying of David: Do not put your trust in princes [Ps 146, 3 (145, 2 Vulg.)] etc. I do not doubt that you have long been aware of what our local theologians have written against you; at the forefront of whom is Westphal, not the least of the infernal fanatics and almost entirely hated by his own church, whose St. Catherine's church would almost never be empty if it did not have an excellent organ, whose and his kind's wickedness, if it deserves any response either witty or salty, let it all be referred to that impudent boy of the appendix dialogue, who does not blush, so that your books contain nothing of mockery, nothing of witticisms or anything at all that does not exude the utmost seriousness worthy of your church. If the boy, being noble, has erred by speaking too freely, he can be corrected by his teacher and deemed worthy of pardon for the decorum of his person. If the dialogue does not please you under your name, you can publish it under the name of Arbogast, an unknown friend, or any other name that may be useful to you. Farewell.</p>
      <p>From Hamburg, February 28, 1554. Your and your church's devoted client, Baptist Johannes Wisamer, has signed. The boy can also be imagined in the dialogue as having come from Italy, where the name Baptist is very common and usual. To the most excellent and pious men and faithful pastors and doctors of the Zurich church, Heinrich Bullinger, Theodor Bibliander, and Rudolf Gwalther, their most esteemed lords and patrons.</p>
