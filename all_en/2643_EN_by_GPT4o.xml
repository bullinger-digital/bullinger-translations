      <p>Greetings. Through the young man who is here, I sent to you some time ago and I believe you have received them. Meanwhile, we have been troubled by the wicked, who have tried to overthrow the doctrine of piety among us, for if their error were to prevail, justification, grace, and the gospel itself with Christ would have to be abolished, and for the exaltation of God, man would have to be magnified. The envy that Calvin, a distinguished servant of Christ, suffers among many and undeservedly, has greatly hindered the cause. Indeed, the adversaries deserve to have their evil cause dealt with badly, and I cannot sufficiently marvel that they have so much favor anywhere and that it has come to the point that, beyond the truth and those who have acted and stood for it until now, no offense has been taken into account, but rather an occasion has been sought. Haller and his colleagues have been exceedingly pleasing in this cause, who have acted unanimously for the truth of the Lord. May Christ be with them forever. What has finally been done, I do not know, as no one has informed me, although I am quite distressed, not to mention Calvin, Viret, and other pious ones, who sincerely strive for the glory of Christ, and lest the enemy allow anything to remain quiet, the grave rumor of Tossanus almost completes it, and nothing is apparent from which counsel can be taken. The wicked have come to the point of making little of condemning the innocent and perverting everything at will. May Christ take care of His cause and be with His own and convert the wretched. What happened to the pious in Lucerne has filled us with bitter joy; for it pains us that they have been driven from their seats and could not have a church among their own and that what the Lord had begun could not be brought to completion there, and that the adversaries are so blind that they do not see whom they are persecuting and that they are destroying themselves and striving to drag others into perdition with them; but with exaltation, we give thanks to the Lord that they have persevered steadfastly and continue even today in the doctrine of piety, and when we heard that among the defeated there were not a few poor, as soon as we heard that elsewhere it was arranged to assist the poor, I and my colleague urged the church entrusted to us; that all should be mindful of the poor, which they heard sincerely and, unless I am mistaken, both from the hospital and from those who individually gave, 176 pounds were found. There are only about 37 crowns of the Savoyard head tax. The prefect, as he is pious, has done his part, not only exhorting this city but also all of this jurisdiction and sincerely desires that the poor be provided for, and as far as we could know, our citizens have testified that they are ready and would like the pious to be more liberally provided for, nor do I think the brothers have ceased in the field, but have diligently admonished that all should bring about the effect. What they have obtained has not been indicated to me. I am very pleased with these beginnings, which I wish may open the way for holy collections, so that the saints who truly act may be assisted. Since I cannot meet with the brothers nor can this church due to the diversity of languages, which sin has brought upon us, you for Christ's sake will meet with them for us and ask them to kindly consider this poverty and understand that the pious have more holy affections than their hands testify. And as we congratulate them on their faith and constancy, so we pray that, filled with fuller gifts of the Holy Spirit, they may grow and persevere in every blessing of the Lord, and we wish to be commended to the Lord by the prayers of the holy brothers. From a few, you can understand all who are here sincerely wish well to the pious; if I were to try to open the affection of many to you, I do not know when I would finish. One prefect would fill many pages.</p>
      <p>The rumor that has spread everywhere about the vengeance of the Lord, which awaits all the impious, over the monstrous portent of Mary of England, has given us hope that with the removal of the dire monster, Christ will grant a sword and power to the Christian heart, which will strive that one does not go to the pope for obtaining pardon and acknowledging him as the head of the church, which indeed is, but of the malignant, as it has been testified and has striven to testify malignantly about the evil, but that it may strive to invoke Christ Himself with all its might and to humbly seek pardon from such a merciful Savior and to acknowledge the true and only head of the church and to hear Him alone.</p>
      <p>If through a woman the Lord wishes to complete what He began by liberating from death, we will give thanks to the Lord, who does not regard our sins, but His only begotten and what He endured in the flesh for us, and not only may He act kindly in England, but also with all to whom He has made such light shine, that we may fully perceive what is offered and given to us in the gospel, that with greater faith, reverence, and worship we may receive, hold, and keep them and gratefully worship the Giver supremely and act among ourselves so that all saying and thinking the same, all made one in Christ in peace, concord, and truth, we may strive more and more for the glory of Christ and the propagation of the gospel, so that at last we may see Christ reigning everywhere with all impiety exterminated. Farewell, most upright man, and strive to accomplish what you do in the church of the Lord, whom Christ may keep you safe and yours. I wish the colleagues safe in the Lord, not to pass over the holy old man Pellican, both father and son Hab. May the Savior kindly protect all there.</p>
      <p>The prefect sends you greetings and colleague Christophorus and those who preside over the citizens. Neuchâtel, June 4, 1555.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Farel.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious servant of Christ, Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, endowed with remarkable piety and equal learning, brother and most dear fellow minister.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
