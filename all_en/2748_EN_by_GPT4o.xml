      <p>Greetings. I had received more favorable news about the state of the Genevans, but from a citizen of Geneva, who perhaps did not want to speak ill of his homeland.</p>
      <p>However, I believe that what you write is sufficiently and excessively true, as I have some insight into the character of that city, which is sharp and almost insatiable for revenge, and very prone to suspicions if provoked too importunately. I hope, however, that Bern will maintain a sense of moderation and gravity, and will not easily allow the necessary alliance between the two republics to break apart, even though there are those among them who pour cold water on the matter, and such people who have already seemed not to be boiling over. Nevertheless, it is pleasing that your most illustrious council does not neglect this fire, and thinks of extinguishing it early before it grows stronger and the flames licking the roofs refuse any restraint. Would that it be found false what is attributed to our Calvin, about prisoners being persuaded to confess to a false crime through promised security. For this was publicly indicated here and among the foremost as most evident. In the matter of the oath, it appears how human prudence turns in all directions, so that it may please both men and God, and whatever this means, it certainly will not be without scandal nor without offense to God, as far as I understand. But perhaps not even this will find a place among the confederates. There is absolutely nothing new with us, except that in Piedmont, Hugius, the consul of Lucerne, is reported to have passed away. But farewell in Christ Jesus, to whose grace I uniquely commend you. Basel, October 9, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>Greet your fellow ministers, as well as Ochino and Socinus.</p>
      <p>To the most outstanding man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my esteemed lord and fellow minister.</p>
