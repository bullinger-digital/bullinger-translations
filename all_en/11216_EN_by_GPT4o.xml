    <p xml:id="regest1">Ambrosius [Blarer] has returned, but does not know the reason for his expulsion from the territory [of Duke Ulrich]; his departure is likely to complicate the situation of the brothers [in WÃ¼rttemberg]. [Hans] Kotter is returning to Bern without having taken up teaching, as his wife [Anna Tschollier] was dissatisfied and he did not feel up to the task; he was generously gifted, and Zwick does not blame him, but the establishment of the school has thus temporarily failed. Ambrosius [Blarer] cannot follow the call to Augsburg now. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Salvation and peace of Christ.</p>
      <p>You know, dearest Bullinger, that Ambrosius has returned safely. By what fortune he was expelled from the prince's territory, he himself does not know, but it is to be feared that his departure will be very inconvenient for the pious brothers. However, let the will of the Lord be done; our ingratitude deserves such crosses.</p>
      <p>What shall I write about Kotter, the excellent man? He is already preparing to leave. He blames the adverse air, but in truth, his wife is the cause, who has troubled him most miserably. Then he perhaps feared that he might not have the strength to endure the scholastic labors, which he has not yet attempted, because the school has not yet been organized. It should have been divided into four classes with four chosen teachers; he himself would have had the class of reading boys, completely free from all elementary ones and those who learn to connect or paint letters. However, I understand that the good man was freer in Bern and not bound by any laws of teaching or school governance, which our people here do not tolerate. Therefore, the intolerable vexation of his wife and the suspicion of scholastic labor or discipline made him ask and obtain permission from our people to return to his own. Whatever was given to him so far in the name of a stipend, not only was it not reclaimed from him, but twenty gold coins were also added out of generosity by the magistrate, and six by private individuals. Thus the good man leaves on the given occasion, so that the consultation of the school has also fallen into ashes at this time. Otherwise, he is certainly a good man, in retaining whom I tried everything with the good ones, but in vain. I want this to be written not only to you but also to Leo and Megander, and finally to Rhellicanus, whom you will also greet diligently in my name.</p>
      <p>Besides, I have nothing worthy of writing. Ambrosius is seriously called to Augsburg, but now it cannot be done to comply with them. After the winter, what will happen, the Lord knows.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all the good ones, especially your wife, mother, and household. 10th of September 1538.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
