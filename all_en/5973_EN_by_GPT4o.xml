      <p>S. I give you the greatest thanks I can, honorable and esteemed godfather, for all the kindness and benevolence with which you recently received me and mine, when we were there with you; I pray to the Lord that He may repay you and also pursue you and yours with His love.</p>
      <p>As for me, I also wish for an opportunity to express my gratitude, which I hope will be given at some point.</p>
      <p>Regarding our affairs, I believe you have meanwhile understood from those letters I recently wrote to my brother, what the Genevans have done here and what response was given to them.</p>
      <p>I hope that with the death of the Duke of Savoy, whatever danger threatens either them or us from there will be removed.</p>
      <p>For all who come from there testify, as Beza also confirms in his letters to me, that his illness has so worsened that there is almost no hope of life left.</p>
      <p>May the Lord do what seems good to Him and beneficial to us.</p>
      <p>As for French affairs, there is no need for me to write anything, since I know that you have received many letters through Linerus of St. Gallen these days, in which you have been informed about each of these matters.</p>
      <p>Now there are also other letters, which Beza sent to me attached to mine, from which you will learn more; for if I did not know that he writes to you the same things he wrote to me, I would want to transcribe mine here.</p>
      <p>Our Savoyard matter depends on the health of the prince; for since he began to suffer, no response has been given from him.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, we have lost an excellent and most upright man, Crispin Vischer; shortly before him, Peter St√ºrler also passed away, likewise a most serious senator.</p>
      <p>Thus, our republic is quite shaken by the loss of such men; may the Lord provide other pious, strong, and wise men and preserve us in His grace!</p>
      <p>To the late Musculus, Benedict Aretius, our pious and modest man, has been appointed; also in the election were Hyperius and Abraham Musculus; however, our people did not think Hyperius should be called from there, as he could be more useful there than here.</p>
      <p>Abraham, however, was appointed to the church of Thun, which is the principal one in this dominion after ours.</p>
      <p>To Benedict, Valentin Ampelander, Musculus's son-in-law, a very learned, pious, and modest man, and who is entirely ours, was appointed.</p>
      <p>Thus, by the grace of the Lord, we have been moderately well provided for again.</p>
      <p>I am very sorry for the misery, old age, and especially the delirium of the old man Ochino; it was rightly done by yours that they removed the stain of this infamy from your church with such severity.</p>
      <p>May the Lord protect us from such minds and spirits and confirm and preserve us more and more in His truth.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>Greet all yours in my name and also give thanks for all the services and benefits rendered to me, especially to your Johann Rudolf, who, before I left, sent me some partridges, for which I could not thank him due to my imminent departure.</p>
      <p>My wife also sends her greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 14, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful pastor of the church of Zurich, his honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
