    <p xml:id="regest1">The bearer of the letter, Pastor Ulrich [Zingg] from Rüti, will report on the ruthlessness and rudeness of the bailiff [Hans Habersaat] and the monks in Rüti, on the violence of the bailiff towards the poor and his dissolute life with his housekeeper, as well as on the agreement between [the former monk Wolfgang] Huber and Pastor Hans [Breitenweg] in Goßau regarding preaching. Apparently, Habersaat complained about Zingg before the Great Council on March 12 and requested dismissal, but he was confirmed, while Zingg is to be transferred. Please assist the pious and honorable brother in being heard and prevent him from being driven from his benefice, which he has held since his youth, because of a rude, envious person.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God, the Father, through Christ, our Savior, beforehand etc.</p>
      <p>The bearer of this letter, the learned, faithful, dear lord and father, Mr. Ulrich Zingg from Rüti, will orally inform you of the great, ruthless rudeness of the bailiff and the monks in Rüti, how unfriendly he is hated and banned there, how the aforementioned bailiff weakens the alms, wounds the poor people and bloodily burdens them with the responsibility of supporting other people expelled from the monastery; also how he keeps a disgraceful whore, who is his housekeeper and causes much unrest in the monastery; also how Huber has come to an agreement with Mr. Hans Breitenweg from Goßau regarding preaching; also what scandalous whoring takes place in the house, where the good brother must live with his wife and children, and many other scandalous matters etc.</p>
      <p>We have been secretly informed about all this by good patrons, how Habersaat requested dismissal from the council and citizens on the Saturday before Reminiscere, with the pretext that he could not get along with his preacher. Our lords have confirmed the rude man again with the explanation that Mr. Ulrich and he should be heard and a way should be sought so that Mr. Ulrich can be transferred. And although this would not be contrary to the good brother, it is nevertheless distressing not only to us but to many other upright people that in this house, which is governed by our lords, there is no place for decency and no pious preacher can remain.</p>
      <p>Therefore, we appeal to you, our dear lord and father, with our humble request for God's sake, that you may advise and assist the poor, good brother (of whom we know nothing but piety, honor, and goodness), so that he may defend his affairs and complain about the great, unnatural and ruthless rudeness of the bailiff. You should also not allow, to the best of your ability, that a rude, envious person can always drive a pious, unblemished man with wife and children from his natural property, in which he has invested and befriended in his youth, at his pleasure, but consider where such an example might lead.</p>
      <p>With this, we commend you to the Lord God and act as fathers. We will always be willing to earn this from you together and individually etc.</p>
      <p>Given at Bubikon in the common colloquium, Tuesday after Reminiscere, the 15th of March in the year etc. 1541.</p>
      <p>Your all willing servant of the Church of Christ in the office</p>
      <p>Grüningen together and especially.</p>
      <p>To the pious, learned, and faithful M. Leo Jud, M. Heinrich Bullinger, and Mr. Caspar Grossmann, preachers of the word of God in Zurich, our dear lords and fathers.</p>
