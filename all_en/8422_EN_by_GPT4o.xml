      <p>Gracious sir, dear brother, my willing service and all good things beforehand. Your letter indeed has caused me no small concern due to the unstable circumstances; for while an honorable council has given a final and fair, divine judgment, it would be proper, propter maiestatem senatoriam, that it remains so.</p>
      <p>However, that publicly and secretly, as he can, Mr. Ganthner acts against it and yet may well know what might follow from it, if God does not intervene, I can only judge that Ganthner does not hold to an honorable council and their recognition as he should. His dealings also tend towards inciting the citizens against the council's way and, if one were to give it the right name, instigating rebellion, etc. His complaint that he is treated unfavorably is shameless. For if he has preached as you have previously informed me, he has indeed deserved dismissal. His articles are also publicly Anabaptist and against God's word, as I have previously written to you, and it is to be wondered that so much violence, injustice, and arrogance is tolerated in him. I see the matter before my eyes, that if the matter is not addressed, Ganthner will cause misery and distress to follow. In short: his actions do not align with our confession, and that my lords of Zürich, acting against the Anabaptists, act also against the imperial majesty and the entire empire, as well as all other cities in the confederation, and he always claims that he will never bring it about. Therefore, you should strive with the invocation of God to act wisely and ensure that no discord arises among the citizens. It is not an improper means that is proposed by an honorable council; one should call upon learned people from the Bündner etc., and if you are involved in it, that something is written or requested from here, do not fail to ensure that it is done properly with a council's delegation, etc. And as you ask what I think of Brentz's little book, I say that he did not put his own name on it, but attributed it to the name Wittelingi, and the other names like Monfortii etc. are also fictitious, so that those who wrote such little books are not so honorable nor trustworthy in the matter, as they have put other fictitious names on them. And I hold nothing of such little books; for they serve nowhere but to overturn the churches and government and to open the doors to all heresies, sects, and wantonness. I send you herewith the refutation of these useless little books per Beza, but I ask you to keep it clean for me and to send it back promptly and well-preserved, so that it is not lost or becomes useless. At this time, I can and may not write more; for I am still not well, and yet I must always work more than I almost can. May God grant His grace and turn away all unrest!</p>
      <p>May the Lord be with you and strengthen you with His spirit, so that you may steadfastly defend the truth against errors and lies! Pray to the Lord, that He may be in your mouth, etc. Aernius is with me today, who is very sorry for the trouble imposed on you; he sends you greetings and bids you to be strong in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>November 10, 1570.</p>
      <p>Yours, Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable Mr. Tobias Egli, minister of the church in Chur, beloved brother and fellow minister.</p>
