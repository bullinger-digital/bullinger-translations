      <p>From France, we hear nothing except that Cardinal Lorraine is terribly afraid for himself due to the tyranny he exercised and the death of Mr. de Bourg, whom he had first strangled and then burned, causing great indignation among many powerful people and the entire nobility. The number of faithful is growing throughout France with remarkable success. - In Spain, the bishops and inquisitors managed to have 124 people killed in one day for the sake of the purer religion. The king, when he showed himself to be burdened and said it would be better to convene a national council, was severely rebuked by the bishops, who asserted that this was not permissible for the king of Spain, etc.</p>
      <p>They will soon receive their reward. - From Germany, friends write that the Diet of the Lantsperg Alliance is being held in Ingolstadt, to which envoys have been sent by the Protestants to hold a diet in Worms. Meanwhile, soldiers are being recruited everywhere, and expeditions are being made; it is unknown for what purpose or against whom. Some think and hope that these disturbances will be settled soon.</p>
      <p>I see these movements arising by the breath of the Lord. If only repentance would turn to God! I fear the matter will have a bad end; everything is inflamed.</p>
      <p>We must pray to the Lord for peace.</p>
      <p>Visitors from the princes of Württemberg, Zweibrücken, and Hanau, who are the guardians of Count Georg's children, have come and wanted to impose the Württemberg reformation; but Erbius, Mylagrius [Myliagrius?], Rhegius, and Goettius refused; the rest are undecided. We await what will happen... Remember the most learned man, Mr. Naogeorgus. March 22, 1560.</p>
      <p>Frosch[ower] is now traveling to Frankfurt. My pastor is curious about how the matter of the oath stands.</p>
