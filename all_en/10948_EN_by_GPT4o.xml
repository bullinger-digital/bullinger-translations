Bern has decided not to accept unclear articles of faith without attached explanations. Refers to a letter from Megander.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God through Jesus Christ. I had planned, based on the persuasion of my dearest brothers Kaspar and Rhellicanus, to travel to Zurich. However, when I learned on the way that your synod had already concluded, I went directly to Schaffhausen, thinking that the rest could be accomplished through letters. Therefore, if there is anything you deem worthy for me to deliver to Bern, please inform me by letter. As for myself, I have nothing to communicate to you except that the Christian republic of Bern is doing very well. For our senate, together with the citizens, has decreed that they will not accept any obscure articles unless they are explained with appendices, so that the holy truth may return to posterity sound and intact.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most sincere brothers.</p>
      <p>From Schaffhausen, November 2, 1536.</p>
      <p>What Megander wishes to be done by Bullinger, you will perceive from the handwriting.</p>
      <p>Erasmus Ritter, entirely yours from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent men Heinrich Bullinger, Theodor Bibliander, dearest brothers teaching Christ in Zurich.</p>
