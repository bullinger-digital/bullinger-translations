      <p>Most illustrious Bullinger, I have not written to you since I replied to your letter in which you informed me about the English situation, nor have I received any further letters from you. For nothing occurred that I deemed worthy of your attention. Now I write only to say that near the end of this August (as I have previously promised), I will visit you, Heinrich Bullinger; the decision stands; I hope to come at that time.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, if a small vessel with books reaches you from Basel, make sure it is sent to Chur in the Grisons as soon as possible, which I ask of you, and also ensure that the letters I send here are delivered to Geneva. They write from Italy that the fleet of the Emperor of the Turks has invaded some port not far from Naples and that the entire maritime coast is in great terror. But if only that fleet would also reach Rome! Who would not prefer the domination of the Turks to serving the Antichrist? Farewell and greetings to the whole church, school, and family; pray for me.</p>
      <p>Vicosoprano, on the first day of August 1552.</p>
      <p>Vergerius.</p>
      <p>Eight days ago, God expelled the mass and papism from a certain town in the Engadine, named Bever, near S-chanf; I hope the same will happen to another, named Sei, also in the Engadine, within another eight days. The Lord uses my ministry in these small battles against the devil and the pope.</p>
      <p>The messenger proceeds as far as Basel. Ask him, when he returns, to stop by you, so that you can write to me, which I ask of you; indeed, make sure he meets my nephews.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. Bullinger, etc.</p>
