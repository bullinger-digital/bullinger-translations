      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you, well-learned and dear friend. We received your letter along with two booklets you sent us on the 22nd of September, partially read them, and sincerely wish that this long-standing dispute in the significant matter of the Holy Supper of our Lord Jesus Christ could finally be resolved and bring comfort, strength, and edification to many good-hearted, devout Christians, and be settled and decided in the churches. We would also gladly offer our advice and help where possible, as we have learned that Doctor Jacob Schmidlin, pastor in Göppingen, along with some others, is visiting the Margraviate of Rötteln and, in our opinion, will also come to Basel to speak with the Sulzers and others there. He is a well-educated, learned man and has expressed many good words, indicating that he, as much as possible, wishes to engage in discussions and actions to bring such contentious points of our Christian religion (in which, if one is not stubborn, there is not so much difference) into a Christian unity. Therefore, we kindly request of you, that in such matters, where it concerns you, along with others (as we have no doubt), you may be found to be kind, Christian, and decisive. We did not want to hide this from you out of gracious and good intentions, as we would gladly see such disputes come to rest and peace. We hereby commend you to the protection of the Almighty.</p>
      <p>Dated in Mömpelgard on the 23rd of September in the year 1556. G[eorg] C[ount] of Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>To the well-learned, our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zürich.</p>
      <p>We also graciously thank you for your congratulations on our young son and desire from God nothing more than that, if He grants him life, he may be raised to His fear, honor, and glory.</p>
      <p>Please also convey many kind regards and good wishes to both your mayors on our behalf, and if they are well and prosperous, we would be glad to hear it. We would have written to you long ago, but we have been more burdened with various pressing matters than we would have liked. Dated as in the letter.</p>
