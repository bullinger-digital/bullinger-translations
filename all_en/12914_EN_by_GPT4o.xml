    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Keller is bedridden with illness. However, since Georg Frölich is traveling to Constance and perhaps also to Zurich, he takes the opportunity to write this inelegant letter. He wants to inform Bullinger that both the political and religious future of Augsburg is on the brink, and indeed, the worst is to be expected at any time! For when Emperor Charles V defeats Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony, such oppression will occur in the empire and especially in the imperial cities that have submitted to him, as never before. No sensible person, including Georg Frölich, doubts this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Should God intend such a thing with [the Protestants] because of their misdeeds and ingratitude, then Bullinger should keep his door open for Johannes Haller, Keller, and other colleagues! For even if the religious matter in Augsburg were to be well regulated again, the Emperor will still, under the pretext of maintaining peace in the empire, establish the religious matter in such a way that not only must priests be allowed entry into the cities again, but everyone must also be allowed to join the papal faction. And even if [the Protestants] are granted the preaching of the Gospel for a time, what good is that? For what God-fearing person could tolerate that under his supervision Christ and the Devil are thus united? Bullinger knows what Keller means. The Augsburg pastors are concerned! The council is corrupt, and accordingly, it deals with them.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] The Lord have mercy! Bullinger should forgive any clumsiness.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] [P.S.:] Bullinger may learn more about this from Haller's letter [No. 2867]. He should not let anyone else teach him otherwise!</p>

      <p>Greetings. Since our mutual brother Georg Frölich, the chief scribe, is about to travel to Konstanz and perhaps also to Zürich, I did not want to miss the opportunity to send you this rough letter while I am heavily bedridden. I am particularly motivated by the fact that both secular matters and religion itself are so unstable here that we expect a varied and pernicious change and variation at any moment. For after Emperor Charles V has overcome Elector Johann Friedrich of Saxony, such tyranny will follow in the empire, especially in those cities that have submitted to the emperor and which he still holds by force with many soldiers, as has never been seen or heard in many past centuries; which no prudent person, not even Frölich himself, can deny!</p>

      <p>Therefore, if the Lord intends to punish us for our sins, especially our detestable ingratitude, make sure that your door recognizes Haller, me, and other colleagues without any loss to you. For even if the religious matter here is most happily established, then for this purpose the emperor will confirm the cause of religion for maintaining common peace in the empire, so that not only must priests be allowed to enter again, but they must also be permitted to freely aspire to the former papal faction. We might also be granted the free proclamation of the Gospel for a time, but who among the pious could endure such a union of Christ and Belial under his patronage? You understand what I mean. We are anxious! The magistrate is corrupt; therefore, they conduct everything most corruptly with fraud and deceit and deceive us with words.</p>

      <p>May the Lord have mercy on us! Please consider my foolishness kindly. March 29, 1547, Augsburg. Hastily. Yours in the Lord, Michael Keller.</p>

      <p>You may perhaps receive more detailed information from Haller's letters. I beg you, let no one else persuade you otherwise!</p>
      <p>To the venerable in Christ, Master Heinrich Bullinger, chief bishop of the people of Zürich, his esteemed brother and lord.</p>
