      <p>Venerable father, yesterday evening by the singular providence, clemency, and mercy of God, I arrived here safely, having escaped from the Pharaonic slaughterhouse. Our Beza just informed me of the sudden departure of this messenger; I cannot write more due to grief, I only say: fifty thousand people have been killed in France within the span of eight or ten days; the remaining Christians wander at night in the woods, having, as I hope, experienced greater mercy from the beasts than from those who bear the form of men. You will receive more from me soon; I will also write to the most illustrious man, Mr. Gwalther, whose letter dated July 23 I have received. I hope our Albert has reached you, whom I had placed with the most holy eighty-year-old jurist along with the minister of our church and had vouched for him, nor did any effort or study on my part fail him, as you will understand more fully hereafter. I ask you by the mercy of our God, to urge your magistrates to some pity for our calamities, lest they allow more executioners to depart from their borders to France; for the Swiss guard took the lead in the Parisian massacre. I cannot write more due to tears.</p>
      <p>Farewell then, venerable father, and keep me in your prayers.</p>
      <p>Geneva, October 3, 1572.</p>
      <p>Albert's eighty-year-old host Grossassius was killed in a carriage along with many other equally old men.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Hotman. To my venerable father, the most illustrious Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zurich church, reverend lord and friend.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
