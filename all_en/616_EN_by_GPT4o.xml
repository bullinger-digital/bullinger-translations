      <p>Greetings from the Lord. The appointment of the person I recently mentioned to you has been ratified and confirmed by the Bern Senate. I am utterly amazed at how this happened; I can only assure myself that the Lord will punish the ingratitude of our people with such a pastor. I will follow your advice, but on the condition that you do not delay any longer, so that I am not called when no one else is to be called; for I do not wish to be pushed into any position. You know what I have endured so far, how much I have labored, and how modestly I have had to live. I now see equals openly among us. That new pastor has not yet come to us, but he will come soon. Our people continue in their usual manner, they are utterly ungrateful. I will do what I saw pleases you, diligently awaiting the day of redemption. I pity the simple common people, who have extremely lame and blind predecessors.</p>
      <p>I will wait to see how he will be towards me; undoubtedly, he will live according to the manner of the people who called him, whom he will have to please or be treated miserably. Some threaten me with some unknown harm because of a few sermons I gave before I recently came to you, but they do not dare to proceed with the matter because they fear the people.</p>
      <p>I will now have a colleague who is too frivolous; however, I will continue as I have so far. The apostolic canon lies completely neglected among us; for you will not find more than one or two in it, and that so insignificant that it seems more like a shadow. May the Lord have mercy on us.</p>
      <p>Farewell and do diligently what I trust you will do in my matter. Aarau, August 4, 1549.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Christian Hochholzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man in both learning and piety, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the ZÃ¼rich church, his most esteemed lord.</p>
