      <p>Grace be with you.</p>
      <p>I received your letter yesterday, and today I must respond to so many friends from all sides. For suddenly messengers have come to me heading towards Augsburg, Memmingen, Esslingen, Basel, Bern, and Z端rich. Therefore, a few words in response to yours. Retain Reyst, the consul, a man of utmost integrity and a friend to you and the word, as much as you can, then strive to ensure that he diligently works so that the concord with the people of Bern does not fall apart. I confess, a strange disgrace recently befell our city, which no man can repair unless the new friendship between republics so similar, so equal, and so governed by popular councils on both sides is restored. Let the cruelty of the victorious Five Cantons move you, who insult the free citizens contemptuously and proscribe those who shudder to confess sins into the ear of the priests of the Antichrist. Would it not be better to have come to terms with those equal in faith and religion, would it not be better to forgive the indignities we have suffered, than to expose our people to new insults and retain our anger? I rejoice that the pursuit of peace thrives among you, and it is very pleasant to hear that the church is doing well. Furthermore, I approve that you are preparing a response to the insults of Fabri.</p>
      <p>But regarding the raging Luther, I do not know what to think. The main point, however, is this: either his pamphlet's vanity should be buried in silence or it should be answered by someone not so closely connected to Zwingli. I have done this, but I have done it through private letters here and there. Whether anything should be made public, I cannot decide until I learn the outcome of the evangelical assembly, which is now taking place in Schweinfurt. We must take counsel from the event, but in the meantime, it does not displease me that you attribute the scourge of the Lord to general causes, with Zwingli's zeal purified. Who would bear comparing such a man to the seditious M端ntzerites? But beware of being too lengthy. I would prefer you to act indirectly, with Luther's name suppressed, so that your style might be sharper against Fabri. For he is also very unjust to Luther. Consider whether this would be more advisable. Indeed, I truly think so, that Zwingli should be defended from insult, and then the cause of the disaster should be attributed to God, who did not wish to punish the opinion on the Eucharist, but in His secret judgment, it seemed thus to inflame our people to a more ardent zeal towards Him, and that in that pamphlet against Fabri, as briefly as possible, and with Luther's name omitted, as I said. For there are others who sing similar dirges of victory, whom you could skillfully strike with the same effort.</p>
      <p>The Emperor's plans are entirely directed towards obtaining soldiers against the Turks, who now threaten Hungary with an infinite army, then to have the evangelical princes recognize Ferdinand as king - for until now there has been a clamor against the election as being made contrary to the prescription of the Golden Bull, as they call it -, finally, because our gospel cannot be extinguished by any force at this time, they aim to impose a limit so that it does not spread further. Our envoys have been absent for a month and a half now and have not written a word. From this, it must be inferred that nothing has yet been agreed upon. For it is not permitted for our people to betray the truth, nor perhaps would it be safe for the Emperor to have deviated even a finger's breadth from the prescription of the Roman pontiff. More certain things later.</p>
      <p>Now farewell with your most learned colleagues. All of ours, to a man, send their greetings to you and yours. To whom I have read your letters word for word, because in my absence their ears had been filled with various rumors. Farewell happily.</p>
      <p>Strasbourg, April 21, 1532.</p>
      <p>I commend Karlstadt to all of you. Be vigilant, lest French gold creeps in unnoticed.</p>
      <p>Wolfgang Capito.</p>
      <p>To the clear and pious man Heinrich Bullinger, preacher of the word among the people of Z端rich, his lord and brother to be respected, in Z端rich.</p>
