      <p>Lord Jesus, the true and only savior of the world, bless your most illustrious highness and keep you from all evil. First and humbly, I beg your most illustrious highness, most Christian princess, to graciously forgive me for daring to write to your most illustrious highness. For those who know your most illustrious highness better have solemnly assured me that your most illustrious highness possesses such piety and humanity that you will kindly accept whatever I send. Therefore, trusting in your exceptional piety, I send this booklet. It contains the confession of the French and Swiss churches, to which many churches throughout Germany, as well as several Scottish, Polish, and Hungarian churches, have also subscribed; the English churches also recognize the same. In it, the entire doctrine of true religion is delivered in summary, which is not better known even from the lengthy disputations of others. I also beg your most illustrious highness not to disdain to read the otherwise very brief booklet and to gain the benefit from it, which the merciful Lord will grant. Furthermore, I urge your most illustrious highness to wish to imitate the example of the blessed Queen Esther, who took up the cause of the faithful before her king and most powerful prince.</p>
      <p>To whose action the Lord undoubtedly blessed, and he will also assist your most illustrious highness's intercession, making it glorious in this age and most blessed in the future. I commend myself to your most illustrious highness and offer all my services to the same, and I pray to our Lord God to preserve our most merciful prince together with your most illustrious highness in true peace and happiness. The grace and peace of our Lord Jesus Christ be upon the entire and most extensive principality of Savoy.</p>
      <p>Given in Zürich, the principal city of the Swiss, on April 10, in the year of our salvation 1572.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the church of Zürich, etc.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious princess and lady, Lady Margareta, Duchess of Savoy, my most gracious lady.</p>
