    <p xml:id="regest1">Could not send Vadian's "Aphorisms" to Strasbourg through [Johannes] Fries, as the printing is not yet completed. He also considers it wrong to take [Bucer's] requests for changes into account out of consideration for the concord negotiations; an unequivocal adherence to the truth cannot endanger the agreement, if it is honestly meant, and is more necessary today than ever. The attached explanation of the Wittenberg Concord by the people of Strasbourg unsettles the people of Zurich, as it leaves open whether Luther approves of the [First Helvetic] Confession; rather, everything seems to point to the eventual signing of the [Augsburg] Confession, which Bullinger firmly rejects, as the Apology of the 10th Article explicitly states its agreement with the previous [Roman] doctrine. Bullinger opposes further meetings and declares recognition of the bodily presence of Christ in the sense of this confession to be out of the question.</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from the Lord.</p>
      <p>You requested, most learned Vadian, that I entrust the example of the Aphorisms to our Fries, so that he may ensure it is delivered to Strasbourg as soon as possible. However, since the book is not yet completed, I have left it aside. Furthermore, if the concord they are attempting is such that the holy (I speak the truth, not to flatter), pious, learned, and composed with utmost modesty book could disturb it, it seems to me, by Hercules, unwise and unworthy of you to change even a little in it. For it cannot be called a solid and holy concord if solid and holy writings can harm it; it must be perverse and slippery, to speak freely what I feel. Therefore, the consideration should be for the truth, not for men. You have explained everything that can be said about this matter so plainly, so truly, so modestly, that no one except some quarrelsome person would find anything lacking in it. But I think no account should be taken of such a person. The world has certainly begun to become wise for some years now and is not so dull-nosed that it cannot immediately distinguish the clear from the obscure, the false from the true, the genuine from the counterfeit, and accept the true and clear, reject the false and obscure. Therefore, my dear Vadian, it is necessary to bring the truth to light, which you have done with that book of yours, which all good and learned people will approve of, I know, even if it is less approved by Luther and Bucer, if they have indeed reached such madness. You see many deliberately and, because they have progressed so far, with some fear and because of certain people, cover up what has been exposed, while all good people are indignant at this, the bad ones murmur something, rejoice in secret, and await the hoped-for and expected end. Therefore, it is necessary to shake them out of that hope and clearly restrain them - which will happen when they understand that we will not abandon a just, good, and clear cause -, and to confirm the others in the truth, free them from fear, and keep them in duty, lest, while we wish to win over the contentious and obstinately erring, we also lose both effort and expense and those whom we have made ours with the greatest efforts so far. I certainly think that if ever, now most of all, we need constancy and that we admit nothing obscure, doubtful, and that can be drawn in either direction in our doctrine.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I send through this what has been done among the brothers in Strasbourg. If that is Luther's opinion, as Bucer says it is, your book will stabilize the concord. But if it will disturb it, then Bucer either does not understand Luther or tells us falsehoods and gives a different meaning to the Wittenberg articles than Luther acknowledges. Although that exposition does not please ours in all respects: Leo, Pellican, Bibliander, me, and the others. For everything is told obscurely and in such a way that the adversaries can also interpret each thing for themselves. Above all, it offends that Bucer says Luther demands nothing from us except what Oecolampadius previously wrote, as if we had not professed this very thing in the Basel Confession. But if he approves of this, what need is there for new articles? Therefore, we have not satisfied with the Basel Confession. Furthermore, if Oecolampadius's opinion is pleasing, why did Luther ask Bucer for a retraction because of the epistolary? Is not in this very thing the last dialogue of Oecolampadius, which they now cite more than once in the exposition of the articles? These things make me, my dear Vadian, anxious and utterly perplexed, so that I miserably fear that in this composition a monster is being made and that we are being dealt with slippery, indeed that Luther feels something far different than they say he feels. For what need was there for many things if the matter is as plain as they want it to appear? Why do they not declare in plain words whether Luther can accept the Basel Confession? What need is there for new articles? Previously they promised with holy faith that the Basel Confession would satisfy the learned, but now, neglecting that, new things are brought forward and a new consultation is held, a convention. And what, finally, is the end of conventions, confessions, writings, articles, and subscriptions? I know and am not mistaken: where we have subscribed to the Saxon Confession and Apology. This is indeed the beautiful bride (bride), which is thus disguised and for which one dances with such courtly (artful) steps. For they write in plain words at the end of the articles: "Since all profess that they wish to feel and teach according to the confession and apology of the princes professing the gospel in all articles" etc. However, in the apology of article 10, they boast that the imperial majesty does not disapprove of anything in the article of the Eucharist. Consider, then, what kind of article it is in which the emperor's monks and theologians desire nothing! Then they openly confess in that place that they defend the opinion received so far. But if you do not believe me, read the apology of article 10, and you will see them assert the corporal presence of Christ in the bread. Therefore, I cannot help but fear danger and suspect that some intend to lead us into peril. I will yield not only to these but to all, as much as I can; meanwhile, I will not grant even a little to anyone concerning the true, the just, and the good, I will accept nothing obscure, I will reluctantly attend any convention hereafter. For the more one convenes, the further one departs from the truth and pure simplicity. I will adhere to the divine prescriptions, acknowledge the Basel Confession, Augustine's opinion on this matter, the writings of Zwingli, Oecolampadius, and Vadian; I will never acknowledge the corporal presence of Christ, which the Saxon Confession admits, I will abhor the opinion received so far about the presence of Christ, as long as the spirit governs these limbs.</p>
      <p>I wanted to send this to you, my brother and lord, dearest to me by far. You, for the duty of a brother, will freely advise me wherever I err or feel too obstinate, and you will fare well.</p>
      <p>Zurich, August 6, 1536.</p>
      <p>Your H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To Doctor Joachim Vadian, most prudent consul of St. Gallen, his esteemed lord.</p>
