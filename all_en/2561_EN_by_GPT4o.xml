      <p>Matthias Schenckius to Heinrich Bullinger, Greetings.</p>
      <p>I do not think it necessary, most learned Bullinger, to recount in many words the reasons that have led me to write to you at this time. I only write that Doctor Gereon, when I recently traveled to Konstanz, imposed this task on me: first, to send this money, which is 13 guilders and 54 kreuzers, plus 1 1/2 guilders, to you as soon as possible; then, to point out to you some way of sending letters to Augsburg, since there are so few people traveling there from here. You know, my dear Bullinger, Jacob Funk, the pastor of Biel, who, as I hear, is with you at the very time I am writing this. He has a brother here, Johann Ulrich Kündigmann, known to none of us; if you take care to send your letters to him, there is no doubt that Doctor Gereon will receive them as soon as possible, since every fourteen days someone goes to Augsburg from here, not to mention the many others who are found almost daily. If you can do so without inconvenience, please convey my greetings to Conrad Gessner and support me and my seven children with your renowned prayers. I had hoped to remain in my homeland until you replied to Doctor Gereon; but I see that this is not possible, for both the nature of my duties (I am in charge of the Augsburg school) and the management of my domestic affairs call me home, so that I cannot stay here any longer. Farewell, most excellent Bullinger, and love me. In Konstanz, on the 22nd of February, 1555.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of Zürich, his esteemed lord.</p>
