    <p xml:id="regest1">Despite infrequent writing, [the pastors of Schaffhausen know themselves to be connected to the Zurichers] in mutual love. They ask for an opinion on the question of whether it is permissible for Christians to flee from the plague; he himself has so far rejected this and is not satisfied with Luther's treatise on this problem. Erasmus [Ritter] has reported to him about the appearance of a sectarian from Passau [Ruprecht von Mosham] in Bern; this person is said to be on his way to Zurich after his expulsion. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord, etc.</p>
      <p>That we rarely trouble you with our letters, dear brothers in Christ, more than perhaps the civility of some might demand, is not because we are so obstinate and proud of neck that we do not wish to intercede with the support of the more learned and our brothers and neighbors in governing our church, but either due to an inappropriate modesty or rather, so as not to interrupt your holy and serious studies with our trifles. You are, however, so fixed in our hearts, reverend brothers, that if we could honor you, we would not doubt that we have honored God himself in his servants.</p>
      <p>Therefore, although mutual love is partly nourished and increased by meetings and letters, it remains fixed in our hearts towards you, so that, with divine help, we may preserve the same love, which we believe to be perpetual in you towards us, for your so dutiful charity towards us.</p>
      <p>Therefore, since we need your work and do not doubt that we could easily obtain even greater things from you, I earnestly beg you to deign to indicate to us your judgment by letter, since the Lord visits our church with pestilence and many, especially the wealthier, attempt to escape the plague by fleeing, whether it is permissible for a Christian to seek safety in flight while preserving faith and brotherly love. There are those who think that the Lord should not be tempted in these matters and that flight should be used as a remedy granted by God. Then there are those, to whom I still subscribe, to be honest, who believe that the span of our life is set by the good Father, and not a hair will fall from our head without his will; therefore, it is nowhere permissible for a Christian to flee, especially if the republic needs his work and counsel or if he could greatly offend and deter the spirits of his fellow citizens by his flight, especially since the civil oath binds citizens to each other so that they should bear both prosperity and adversity, joy and sorrow, with unanimous consent as a duty.</p>
      <p>We have read Luther's booklet on this matter, which has not yet satisfied our mind. Therefore, most humane brothers, I beg you for your love for the Church of Christ to deign to reveal your opinion on this matter to me, so that, having been taught better, I may change my mind in time or, if your judgment agrees with mine, I may dare to propose this opinion to our church with greater courage. If the Lord gives any occasion to deserve your service to us, you will find us eager and benevolent. Pray to our Lord to give us greater patience and more vivid increases of faith, so that we may bear both prosperity and adversity with equanimity.</p>
      <p>Erasmus, the minister of the Bernese church, wrote to me these days that a certain dean from Padua, a man of a different sect from us, very eloquent in Latin and his own language, a man particularly cunning and smoother than a snake, was recently with them. He approached the council and tried to obtain a colloquium or disputation with the ministers of the word, whom he had not yet addressed. However, the council, fearing that the man might stir up trouble, banned him from the city and the countryside. Finally, he met with the preachers and requested a friendly colloquium on the matter of religion. Being aware of the wrongness of the matter initiated by him, they did not want to engage with the man. They say he has gone to Zurich.</p>
      <p>I do not doubt, however, that you, with your prudence and sagacity, will easily anticipate the man's cunning. Nevertheless, I did not want you to be unaware of this matter.</p>
      <p>May Christ preserve you unharmed for a long time for his church. My fellow ministers Lingkius and Grubellius and others greet you. Schaffhausen, the tenth day of September in the year 1541 after Christ's birth.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Simprecht Vogt, minister of the church of Schaffhausen.</p>
      <p>To the distinguished men in doctrine and piety, Theodor Bibliander, Leo Jud, Heinrich Bullinger, Caspar Megander, ministers of the church of Zurich, most esteemed brothers in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
