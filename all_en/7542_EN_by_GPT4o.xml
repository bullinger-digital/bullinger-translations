      <p>Greetings. Although it may seem unnecessary to write through him who will recount all our matters to you, nevertheless, so as not to neglect my duty, I wanted to give him this letter, so that you may understand that nothing was lacking in my diligence. If only I were allowed to travel with him and speak to you in person! This will happen another time, God willing. As for the current matters, our lords are moderately inclined to support the causes for which our envoy is sent to you, and if the same willingness can be found in other republics, they will do whatever they can. The pious ought to be helped in some way. We will not always sit as mere spectators of others' calamities, and this can be done with less danger than when Condé was requesting similar things; for we owe nothing to the Spaniard outside of that Burgundian union. We also hear that things are going well for our people in the Netherlands; they have won several times and worn down the strength of the Spaniards who are there now. And if only our people knew how to use these victories and act on their affairs promptly, before new troops are brought from Spain or Italy! It is certain that the Duke of Savoy has reviewed his troops; but for what purpose, it is not clear. Condé might also attempt something; for we hear that the king was pleased upon hearing of Egmont's execution and among other remarks, he also said: "By God, we must act in the same way, starting with the leaders." Therefore, these princes, who lead our people into these calamities with their peace treaties, should consider what they themselves should expect. But why do I trouble you? You have already heard everything from Dathenus and will now hear from our Diesbach what could be written from here. Therefore, consider these things well.</p>
      <p>I pray for the well-being of the entire assembly of friends and brothers there. All of ours also send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Bern, July 25, 1568.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
