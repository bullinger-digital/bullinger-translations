      <p>To the learned and pious man Werner Steiner, a priest whom we hold in the highest regard and a most beloved brother, grace and innocence of life through Christ.</p>
      <p>Among the distinguished qualities of your mind, with which you are splendidly adorned, not the least seems to me to be the insatiable desire for learning that you possess. For your most prudent and most loving mind of the best things sees the truth, which in Lucian of Samosata, learning says and promises: "I will adorn you with many and excellent ornaments, namely modesty, justice, piety, gentleness, equity, intelligence, fortitude, love of all honorable things, indeed I will make you well-disposed towards the most serious matters. For these truly adorn a truly whole mind, and finally nothing of ancient things will escape you nor will you be ignorant of what ought to be done now, but with me you will foresee all those things that must be done. And to say everything at once, I will shortly teach you all things, both divine and human."</p>
      <p>And thus far we have produced the words of Lucian, which he attributes to learning. For this most noble fruit of learning, you seem to me to act most wisely, because you embrace honest letters that do not boast of themselves lightly, and you will act much more wisely if you continue to admire them as you have already begun. Indeed, as this cannot be obtained by our own strength, so the heavenly wisdom, which alone possesses this, must be prayed for, that it may always increase virtues, so that persevering in good we may reach the summit of true and pious learning; which I pray the highest and eternal creator of all things may grant you. Amen.</p>
      <p>I have at present written to you extemporaneously the "Method of Studies or the Instruction of a Man Devoted to Studies" at the beginning, to assist your studies, and then, to satisfy your wishes; for you know how anxiously you have requested this very thing from me. Therefore, I have done what I could, but you see from whom you have requested such a great thing. Certainly, it does not escape me that I have undertaken a burden much heavier than my strength, since I neither possess the similar prudence (which was especially required here) due to age, nor have I yet attained mature and manifold learning, nor have I prepared myself with constant exercise. Because you command, I write, and I write to you alone, who knows how to consult everything briefly.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest Werner, etc.</p>
      <p>On the calends of May in the year 1528, in Kappel.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger, entirely devoted to you.</p>
