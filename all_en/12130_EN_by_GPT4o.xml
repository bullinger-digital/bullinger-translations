      <p>Greetings. I would have sent two copies of the papal letters to his people and to the emperor long ago, if there had been someone to carry them. Now, having found a messenger, I am sending the other copies, as I do not doubt that you have already seen the edict of the council. Although it happened that while I was arranging for the letters to be copied to be sent to Calvin, the other copies have not yet returned home. However, if you do not have them, I will ensure that they are sent once I have obtained them; I will obtain them shortly.</p>
      <p>In Worms, there is still no one except the Bishop of Augsburg. Some believe that the Diet will not take place due to the princes' lack of funds. The emperor is draining them, gluttony impoverishes, pride subverts, and if anything remains, they are forced to save it for the future evils, which are certainly looming.</p>
      <p>In Belgium, there is severe persecution of the saints. The entire business has been entrusted to six men; four of them are Spaniards. The soldiers, who were preparing to set out for Alsace, are still marauding in Lorraine. The emperor hears badly from here; however, no one dares to do anything about it.</p>
      <p>Finally, a copy of Luther's booklet has been sent from Strasbourg; I have read it, and I am displeased with its excessive immoderation. And unless you are more prudent, this matter will stir up great evil in the church.</p>
      <p>This little I was permitted to write due to the pain in my eyes. Farewell in Christ with all the pious. Basel, February 16, 1545.</p>
      <p>Yours, Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
