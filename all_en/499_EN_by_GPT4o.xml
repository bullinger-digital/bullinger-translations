      <p>Greetings and a life of innocence from the Lord. How kindly God has been with us so far and made our journey prosperous, most esteemed lord and godfather, we hope you have understood from our letters made in Dietikon, Basel, Strasbourg, Mainz, and Cologne. You will receive those I wrote in Cologne through Mr. Johann Utenhove, a distinguished and upright man, born in Ghent to noble parents. We earnestly pray that you receive him kindly. Furthermore, if there is any mention of the Lord's holy supper, admonish and teach him diligently; you will find nothing more tractable or eager to learn. On April 14, having left Cologne, we set out on a journey towards Antwerp through the barren and sandy Campine of Brabant; on the 18th of the same month, by God's grace, we all arrived safely and unharmed in Antwerp; on the 20th, compelled by the prayers of our king's ambassador, who is now with the Emperor, I went to Brussels together with Johann Stumphius, so that he might see the softness and miseries of the court; furthermore, the servitude of the good citizens of Brussels, who are now forced to endure the rule of the Spaniards, robbery and theft, the violation of daughters, the shamelessness of wives, and finally the threats and blows of the most wicked nation, so that he might consider more deeply the state and condition of his country, pray more fervently for it, and more diligently admonish his people, so that they might become more cautious, taught by the misfortunes of others.</p>
      <p>We did not see the Emperor, who rarely leaves his chamber, nor his son, who celebrated Easter outside the city in a certain monastery. Johann Stumphius saw the Duke of Saxony through the windows. I was twice in his house, very kindly received by his Germans, who still serve him, numbering 30. The Duke wanted to admit me to a conversation two or three times, but the presence of the first captain of the Spaniards always prevented it. He lives steadfastly in his faith and is healthy as far as bodily health is concerned; there is no hope at all for his liberation, unless, God forbid, he changes his religion and despairs of the word of God. The clever Landgrave is held captive in Oudenaarde, seven miles from Ghent, a man miserable and inconstant in every way: now he promises all obedience and faith to the Emperor, embraces the mass and other impious rites with open arms; now he curses and detests the Emperor with his interim decree. May the Lord have mercy on him! He is miserably afflicted and is already paying the deserved penalties for his treachery. We also saw Lazarus Swendius, that traitor whom you know.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Brandenburgers and other German slaves of the Spaniards, there is no need for me to write. The Pope's legate preached in his court throughout Lent; how impiously, I will not write. However, I know for certain that things are not well between the Pope and the Emperor, nor between the French and the Emperor. Each greatly fears the Emperor. The Emperor, in turn, greatly fears the Pope's thunderbolt. They are now seriously discussing whether the general council should be held in Trent or Bologna. The Pope urges, commands, asks, and orders the Emperor to agree to Bologna; he refuses, denies, and absolutely rejects it in every way, and says he would rather dissolve all friendships with the Pope than admit that place (Bologna, that is). What monstrosity lies hidden in this on the part of the Pope, one may easily guess; he greatly distrusts his reign: for I learned from our ambassador that if the Emperor's confessor were moderately pious, there would be great hope that he would soon be led to the knowledge of Christ; for he openly told me that both the Emperor and all his counselors are ruled, driven, led, and drawn by the confessor, who does everything by the Pope's persuasion and advice. And I easily believe it; for 7 months ago, when the Emperor was still in Upper Germany, he was abandoned by his confessor because he did not want to act more cruelly against pious men and restore the papacy in full.</p>
      <p>The Emperor offered him a bishopric in Spain worth 20,000 crowns per year; he disregarded the Emperor's generosity and the Emperor himself with these words: "I owe myself entirely to the Church of Christ, but not to you nor to your gift, unless you prefer to serve the church with greater zeal."</p>
      <p>Now about the Emperor's mind towards Switzerland: all agree that he envies your liberty with hostility, furthermore, he will leave no stone unturned to break the concord among you; if things do not succeed in this way, he will do everything with promises: therefore, beware lest he deceive you with empty hope. Finally, without a doubt, he will attack you with a hostile hand, not to conquer in this way, or to expose many of his own to danger, but to instill fear in you. I therefore ask that you love each other unanimously and mutually: fear God, live holy, fight bravely, and expect victory from God who will undoubtedly be with you to defend you. They still think that no danger threatens you; but always be prepared, and let all security be far away, lest it overwhelm you unawares.</p>
      <p>The Emperor still knows well that he cannot use the affairs of Germany as he wishes. It has often grieved him (as I have heard from trustworthy men) that he changed something in religion, which, if he had promised the Germans freedom, would have been most beneficial to his affairs. They say the Emperor will soon depart for Ghent, and from Ghent will again head to Brussels or ascend towards Speyer. He has troops near Bremen and the maritime cities, but they are idle; they achieve nothing, nor are they much feared by the citizens; day by day the cities fortify themselves more and more, and they have provisions for five years, nor do they much longer seek the Emperor's favor.</p>
      <p>I believe you are not unaware of the heavy exactions the Emperor now demands from his people; however, I will tell you the sad and deplorable speech that our pious hostess in Campine poured out. "If," she said, "I could bear the great and now burdensome crowd of my children in my house, I would flee and seek sustenance through alms; for the Emperor's and the queen's tax collectors exhaust the labors of our sweat." In this respect, the English are also now greatly suffering. A fifth part of all goods has been granted to the king. But still about Switzerland. Yesterday, April 25, invited to a meal by a certain citizen of Antwerp, who knows Switzerland very well, and has often displayed his goods in all the cities of the Swiss, he told me that he frequently saw in the Emperor's court, since the Emperor left Upper Germany, public ministers of the city of Lucerne; for he knows them well by the color of their clothes: it is to be feared that the secrets of the country may be revealed through such people, or some greater evil may lie hidden.</p>
      <p>On May 1, they will hold a new triumph in Brussels in honor of the Prince of Spain. You heard about the previous one through Mr. Johann Utenhove, I hope; but since he did not see the new gates and columns erected in the city, you should know that on the first gate there is a column inscribed, "Blessed are those who obey his command."</p>
      <p>Who would deny that the race of the Austrians, who would deny that the high lineage of the Emperor is truly of the Herculean race?</p>
      <p>On the other side: They boast of Hercules' trifles and fictitious monsters: Charles' daring deeds prove his brave actions.</p>
      <p>On the second gate: Holy faith rightly praises you and your fathers, By whose help faith began and was increased.</p>
      <p>On the other side: It proclaims itself thrice happy in this auspicious time, Because the Augustan offspring remains safe under its protection.</p>
      <p>The third gate has an image of Hercules sailing with his columns, to which a male statue is placed on either side. The first says: "Proceed," the other: "Come." These are the verses: May the heavenly palm be present for Charles' labor, And may the first glory remain to God alone.</p>
      <p>Also: May faithful delay restore the matter and further promote the Christian faith.</p>
      <p>In Antwerp, an eagle is depicted with outstretched wings, under whose feet this impious application of the sacred is inscribed: "Protect us under the shadow of your wings."</p>
      <p>On May 1, in the triumph in Brussels, the first to compete with lances on horses were the Prince of Spain and the son of the Duke of Ascot of Brabant. I do not know by what fate or negligence the prince's helmet, poorly fastened, could not withstand the blow of the son of Ascot's lance, so that the prince was wounded twice in the face, once on the chin, the second time on the forehead; but there will be no danger from the wounds.</p>
      <p>However, the Emperor, struck with fear, postponed the begun contest to the eighth day following. I hear that East Frisia has admitted the Emperor's interim decree; if this is the case, Mr. a Lasco will soon return to England, whose absence I greatly regret, especially since Peter Martyr and Bernardino fiercely defend Lutheranism and now there is also a third, who will leave no stone unturned to obtain the place; he is Bucer. All the English, as I hear, think rightly about that matter. If Mr. a Lasco does not come to us soon, I will send him your letters with the writing; but if God wills, I would prefer to meet the men in person. We stayed here for 14 days, so that we might more conveniently cross to England from here with a learned and experienced English sailor, who is here and waiting for cargo; but I fear that the wind may change to the contrary; then we will lose both time and expenses in vain.</p>
