      <p>Greetings. This man wishes to be recommended to you. For several months he taught children here, but he got into a dispute with some citizens, so he decided to change his place. How his other affairs are, you will learn from him. I am not willingly troublesome to you with such recommendations, but having been asked by him and a certain tribune of our city, to whom he was very familiar and whose children he taught, I could not deny him this. As for your relative, I would wish for him to be as well provided for as possible for your sake; but you know how great the abundance of scribes is among us, so that I do not know whether I can give him any hope of obtaining a position here. If anything is vacant, many flock together, aided by families, relationships, and other such matters. The same is told to me by Mr. Nikolaus Zerkinden, my co-father, and by Mr. Giron, the prothonotary himself, to whom I have diligently recommended this matter. In the cities of Aargau, perhaps he could be better provided for; but since they enjoy their freedom in receiving such men and, as far as we know, do not lack them either, we do not know what should or can be done. The Aargau scribe Mr. Gabriel, known to you and very devoted to you, could advise. I had previously advised that he come here, which I still advise if he wants to hope for anything here; for nothing will be granted to an unknown and unrequested person. If he wishes to come, I advise that you recommend him to Mr. Nikolaus von Diesbach and Mr. Giron, to whom I know your letters will be welcome; he is fond of you, a man of integrity and learned.</p>
      <p>Regarding other matters, I recently wrote some things to my brother, of which he will inform you. The Geneva alliance has not yet come together and will hardly be settled without arbitrators. The Genevans do not want to yield to the conditions, which our people also do not want to accept. If the cities seriously intervened, I would have good hope. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Bern, April 27, 1556.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the ZÃ¼rich church, his most dear and esteemed lord and co-father.</p>
