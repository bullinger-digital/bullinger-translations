      <p>Greetings. I have just now received your letters along with those of our Calvin, in which you wish to be informed about what Gwalther and I intend to do with the French book sent to us, which you desire to be translated into our language and printed.</p>
      <p>However, that Michael Cunerus, otherwise an excellent man, was delayed on his journey due to physical weakness; therefore, only in these recent days did he deliver the book to us.</p>
      <p>Master Georg Cellarius has received it and will attempt to translate it; we have spoken with Froschauer, who has not shown himself to be difficult, provided it is translated in a timely manner.</p>
      <p>I am pressing on; for you know that only a few days remain until the fair, during which the printers can print.</p>
      <p>This matter is dear to us, and nothing will be lacking in our diligence.</p>
      <p>I have somewhat recovered; but numbness of the limbs occupies my body, and I feel perpetual pains in both my head and stomach.</p>
      <p>May the Lord do what is good in His eyes!</p>
      <p>Zürich, Bern, and Schaffhausen are indignant that Sulcerus and Coccius subscribed to the Confession and Apology of Augsburg in the Strasbourg agreement; for now, there is a rumor that the people of Basel have separated themselves from the other Swiss cities and have accepted Luther's doctrine in the supper.</p>
      <p>The cities have consulted on this matter; during the consultation, Sulcerus came to Bern; summoned to the council and asked what he had done in Strasbourg, he replied that the acts are contained in a deposition with the council in Basel.</p>
      <p>Therefore, a letter was sent to Basel requesting the acts; the people of Basel responded that they have no acts and have only heard a report from Sulcerus about the settlement of the predestination dispute.</p>
      <p>The cities, since they know for certain that he subscribed, are consulting further on what needs to be done.</p>
      <p>Whatever happens, I will write at the earliest opportunity.</p>
      <p>Sulcerus is an excellent equivocator; it is said that he recommends the books of Paul Eber (in which Calvin is specifically criticized) and Martin Chemnitz, etc.</p>
      <p>I cannot write more; the courier is in haste.</p>
      <p>May Master Calvin, Master Jonville, and all the brothers be safe.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you. August 8, 1563.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Master Théodore de Bèze, the most faithful minister of the church of Geneva, most esteemed lord and dearest brother.</p>
