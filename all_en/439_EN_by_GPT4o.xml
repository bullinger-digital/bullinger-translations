      <p>Greetings. Our esteemed and beloved colleague and brother, the honorable and beloved brother of ours, D. Wolfgang Musculus, has come to you, venerable and beloved fellow ministers and brothers, called by the unanimous consent of all of you by the most illustrious senate of your city to the ministry of your church. We indeed congratulate both you and the church, giving thanks to our Lord Jesus Christ, who has deemed it worthy to inspire that calling into your hearts and those of your people. For we hope that he will be beneficial to the church, to you, and to all of us; for he is a man of the greatest piety, rare learning, excellent gifts of spirit, and a life entirely blameless. He conducted himself bravely, prudently, and candidly in the extreme danger at Augsburg, steadfastly confessing Christ and the Christian doctrine openly in the public assembly at the last Diet of Augsburg, where the Emperor himself, with the king his brother, the princes of Germany, Spain, Hungary, Italy, and a throng of bishops, elated and fierce with recent victory and captured princes, was almost threatening the utter destruction of our religion. And when miserable Augsburg, inclining towards the Emperor's side, was deviating from the purity of religion, this good man preferred, with the greatest loss of his affairs and nine children, to choose exile rather than, laden with royal gifts, to approve by a nod the adulterated Interim religion or the Jeroboam-like religion. Thus he finally turned to us as to those whose freedom and religion he had long loved before.</p>
      <p>He was received by us amicably, and would that he had been treated by us as his virtues deserved. He lived among us for several months with his most honorable, well-educated, and pious family blamelessly. He conferred with us once and again about matters of our religion, and furthermore, he preached publicly in our church often, and his doctrine and faith pleased the people and us, nor is there any doubt that he would have been received into the number of ministers of this church if any place had been vacant.</p>
      <p>When we understood that he was called to the ministry of your church, we brought him into our assembly and diligently explained to him what the state of your church once was and what it is now, exhorting him by all means to strive that the old controversy about the sacrament and the exploded dispute not be revived, nor Buceranism be fostered, etc. To this, he solemnly promised all his effort, and moreover, he recited to us his confession of faith and doctrine, which we approve, not doubting that it will also please you.</p>
      <p>Wherever a declaration is needed, he will satisfy you, so that in all things the name of our Lord Jesus Christ may be glorified and peace and tranquility may be preserved in our churches along with sincere religion.</p>
      <p>We therefore pray through our brotherhood, esteemed and beloved fellow ministers and brothers in the Lord, that you kindly receive this excellent man and confer with him about all things fraternally, then ensure that a worthy stipend necessary for the support of him and his family is ordained by the most ample senate. You will find him neither ungrateful nor moderately useful to the church. What remains, we pray the Lord to bless your labors, keep you in peace, and protect you from all evil. We love you sincerely and are entirely yours. Continue to be towards us as you have been hitherto. Pray for us to the Lord and farewell well.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 20th February, in the year 1549.</p>
      <p>The pastors and readers of sacred literature, ministers of the Church of Zurich, your brothers.</p>
