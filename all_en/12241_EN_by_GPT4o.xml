    <p xml:id="regest1">Cassander has heard very pleasing news about the people of Zurich from Albert [Hardenberg] in Cologne and now also from Gerhard [thom Camph] and Konrad Pellikan's son Samuel in Strasbourg. - He is particularly happy about the harmony prevailing among the people of Zurich regarding the Lord's Supper, which unfortunately became a bone of contention instead of expressing the mutual bond of believers. - May God deliver His churches from their enemies! These persecute the believers in the imperial Netherlands and especially in Flanders. The people of Cologne would also harass the small flock of Christ if they could do what they wanted. They show their Roman zeal not only in their sermons but also through the writings they publish. Citizens of Cologne were even expelled from the city because they received the Lord's Supper in both kinds; among them was the widow of Gisbert Longolius. They refused to bury Longolius's body in Cologne because shortly before his death, Longolius had called a priest to administer the Lord's Supper in both kinds. - From the enclosed booklet ["Dialogus Philalethis"], Bullinger will learn something about the state of Cologne. It is directed against an impudent dialogue ["Echo Melanchtonis"] between Martin [Luther] and Philipp [Melanchthon]: When the first mentions the "fidem iustificantem," the second adds like an echo "cacantem"! - The travel and study companion Cornelis [Wouters] also sends his regards to the people of Zurich. - Letters are welcome. Cassander and Wouters are staying with Paul Fagius, pastor of Young St. Peter, where they are learning Hebrew. - [P.S.:] Greetings to the Zurich council, which received them so generously [in April 1544].</p>

      <p>To the most learned and holy men, ministers and professors of the church of Zurich, Georg Cassander sends greetings.</p>
      <p>It has been several months since the brave and vigorous minister of Christ, Albert [Hardenberg], returning to us in Cologne from you, reported all favorable news about your health and safety; this was confirmed by Gerhard [thom Camph], a learned and pious young man, when he unexpectedly met us in Strasbourg together with Samuel, the son of Konrad Pellikan, your venerable and most holy elder, which was not without great joy to our spirit. For all the pious recognize the extraordinary gifts of God, which you faithfully contribute to support and sustain His church.</p>
      <p>But, oh, happy will be the day when it will be possible to hear that you all, who have undertaken to defend and protect the kingdom of Christ against the tyranny of the antichrist, think and speak the same in the Lord, especially concerning this most sacred mystery of our communion with Christ! For who would not deeply grieve that the cunning of the devil has succeeded to such an extent that this most sacred sacrament of concord, peace, and union has been turned into a matter and instrument of discord and dissension? What, I ask, can be thought more absurd? Yet, much hope is placed in your prudence, modesty, and piety according to God's mercy. And if you cannot yet agree on everything, certainly many pious people wish that the effects and use of this sacrament, about which you almost agree, and whose understanding is very necessary for the people, be diligently and assiduously inculcated, while those more subtle than useful questions about the mode of presence and the consumption by the impious be either ignored or certainly discussed only in private letters or conversations among the learned, and in the meantime, all ways of concord be diligently attempted.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, we will pray to God, as much as we can, that He may deliver His church from all adversities and enemies and also (which I both desire and know is happening in your church) from tyrants and persecutors, by whom, as I think you know, in Lower Germany subject to the emperor and especially in our Flanders, that small flock of Christ, which wanders scattered here and there, is cruelly torn apart and slaughtered; this cruelty the people of Cologne also long for, if only their means were equal to their minds. Certainly, as far as they are concerned, they vigorously declare their zeal for that sacred Roman seat not only by frequent sermons and published books but also by proposed edicts and by expelling citizens from the city for receiving communion in both kinds; among them is the most honorable and holy widow of that distinguished man Gisbert Longolius - who in his time was a great ornament to the city, against whose corpse they even raged, denying burial to the dead because shortly before his death he had summoned a priest who administered to him the body and blood of the Lord according to the evangelical rite.</p>
      <p>But you will learn something about the current state of the people of Cologne from this small booklet, indeed small and slight, but nevertheless not unpleasant to read nor entirely useless. It was written against the most impure and virulent dialogue published in Cologne with the characters of Martin and Philipp introduced, than which nothing more foolish, colder, and more impure has ever been seen; which you may gather even from this one place: For when one of the interlocutors at the end of a verse said "justifying faith," the other, who evidently represented an echo, replied "defecating." The indignity of that booklet extorted the publication of this dialogue.</p>
      <p>But enough of these matters. For I am too impertinently interrupting your most holy affairs. May God preserve you safe and sound in mind and body for His church for a long time. My patron and companion in travels and studies, Cornelis Wouters, commends himself to you.</p>
      <p>From Strasbourg, from the house of Paul Fagius.</p>
      <p>If any of you wish to write to us (which could not be anything but most pleasing to us), you may send it to the house of this Paul Fagius, minister at Young St. Peter, where we are now staying for the sake of Hebrew studies.</p>
      <p>On the sixth day before the Ides of July in the year 45.</p>
      <p>We wish all happiness to your most grave and prudent magistrate, whose remarkable kindness we have experienced, to whom we wish to be commended from the heart.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and holy men, ministers and professors of the church and school of Zurich.</p>
