      <p>Greetings. I received your letters, most esteemed lord and godfather, through our Fietz, and I assume you have also received mine, which I recently wrote through Aloysius Muralt. I can add nothing to those now; for we have nothing new here that is certain. It is established that peace has been proclaimed, the kings are raving, the Greeks are punished. Condé has laid down arms; the Germans, as I hear, have been dismissed and have returned to Germany. The king retains some troops with him for his protection. Peace is not received in the same way everywhere; where the papists are in control, they do not want to accept the evangelicals anymore; churches are confined to a few corners. A certain not unlearned man recently coming from Narbonne in Gaul told me that the papists rule everywhere there; only those two cities, Nîmes and Montpellier, have not yet wanted to accept royal garrisons, because they are stronger than promised; Valence has accepted a garrison, yet the church remains there, but pushed into a corner; there are still churches in Orange and at Saint-Esprit, but everything is overturned in Grenoble; the people of Lyon are still raging and do not want to keep the peace. He could report nothing about the rest of Gaul. I see that what was obtained by the previous edict is scarcely retained. The king has kept some Italians for himself; the rest (this is certain) have returned to Italy. We hear here about some new disturbances in Italy, and that certain cities have defected from the pope. If there is anything certain, share it with us. From the Netherlands, we have nothing besides what you also write about. Everything is calm with us, except that the unfortunate sect of Anabaptists is newly emerging in many places of this dominion, so that we almost daily have dealings with them. The common people are too numerous; they lack nothing except that if they had no rule and authority, they would be masters.</p>
      <p>Beza has been ill for almost two months now; I fear that his labors may exhaust him. My mother has recently gone to the Baden Baths; after she bathes there, she will go to you; I commend her to you.</p>
      <p>All of ours greet you, especially Diesbach. Few of the others are in the city. I pray for the health of all yours.</p>
      <p>Bern, June 11, 1568.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Church of Zurich, my honorable lord and dearest godfather.</p>
      <p>Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zurich.</p>
