      <p>Honorable, learned, and esteemed lords, we commend ourselves to your good grace with all our heart.</p>
      <p>Honorable lords, not long ago a man arrived here, who claims to be from Paris, and in front of our church, he proposed several points of evangelical doctrine on which he refused to be satisfied with the admonitions made to him by our ministers through the Holy Scripture. Therefore, they desired that we bring this matter to your attention to recognize the obstinacy of the said man. For this reason, we have documented this matter in writing, and yet, without distrusting our ministers, but knowing well that your entire purpose and affection is to ensure that nothing remains in the church that is not the pure and holy doctrine of God, we have sent it to you to ask you to write us your good advice on it, so that we may further admonish the said man to bring him back to unity of doctrine or to show him his fault. Therefore, we ask you to respond to this as soon as possible, and while waiting, we will pray to God that it may please Him to preserve and keep you in happiness for the growth of His holy church. From Geneva, the twenty-first of November, one thousand five hundred and fifty-one.</p>
      <p>The syndics and council of Geneva, all ready to please and serve you.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, learned, and esteemed lords, Master Heinrich Bullinger and other ministers of the church of Zürich, our good and singular friends.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
