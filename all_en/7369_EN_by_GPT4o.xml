      <p>S. I have received all your letters; I will send back the written document another time, as it has not yet been returned by the honorable consul.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, young master Balthasar von Haldenstein arrived; however, he has been composing poetry, presenting it as a counterplay, and requests from the honorable mayor that it be read publicly. I am sending you what it is. He writes (as I have copied from his own handwriting) that it was given in Lyon, although he had his own petition printed on it, as I have depicted here. They are engaging in the most shameless mischief; it is far too much. I am also sending two other copies, which I have transcribed from two letters that are very nicely written and circulating among our great Hanses, etc.</p>
      <p>Young master Rudolf von Salis writes about three servants who have returned from Malans, saying that they are bound to be at St. John's Day in Vitry (which is near the Great Châlons, where the king was with his army) with our soldiers, and they are doing quite well. They know nothing of the latest events; they say the king is pursuing the one from Condé, who is marching towards Metz, against the Germans. They have hardly seen any enemy, as twice the cavalry have encountered each other, and they have stood in battle formation. Yesterday, however, I heard from one of my lords that they, along with others, are advancing, driven by need and poverty, that they have left the camp; for they had requested leave from their leaders, who answered them that they were not allowed; they wanted to bring it to the commander. They feared that if it came to the commander, he would have them hanged. Therefore, they have slipped away day and night, as best they could, one today, the other tomorrow, etc. - The dog of young master Remigius von Schauenstein has long since returned home, jumped up at the door after his break, entered the young master's chamber, howled and whimpered on his bed. We thank you most highly for all your goodness.</p>
      <p>The honorable consul, Mr. Carolus, Pontisella, Gantner, send you their most respectful greetings. Quickly. Forgive me, I beg you; for I am overwhelmed. 68. January 13th, Chur.</p>
      <p>Your most humble servant, Tobias Egli. To the highly learned and venerable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his kind lord and father.</p>
