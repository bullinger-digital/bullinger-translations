      <p>May the grace of God be with all who sincerely seek God, etc., especially, dear lord and brother.</p>
      <p>I have well understood your letter. I cannot give a proper answer at this time; because the matter is indeed difficult for me to consider, as it involves several opinions. There is concern that by dissolving the alliances with the cantons, we give them reason to ally themselves elsewhere with princes and lords. The division would mean that those who adhere to God's word in the common lordships and were divided from us would be sent straight to the slaughterhouse. It seems to me and other honorable people either useful. War at this time is not good, as you yourself write. But in all things, one must nevertheless have care, in the hope that God will show grace. It seems good to me that our bailiffs in the Aargau consider a shooting exercise, as is present (imminent), and you, our dear brothers and other fellow brothers in Bremgarten, in Freiamt, etc., and others of the same kind come together and discuss these matters, and then a citizen or brotherly meeting, perhaps of three or four cities, should come together and discuss it. Freiburg and Solothurn are currently not available at this time. Also help, that the shooting proceeds.</p>
      <p>May God grant us all His grace.</p>
      <p>Dated on the 27th day of August in the year 1532.</p>
      <p>Your willing Peter im Haag.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, pious, and learned lord Heinrich Bullinger, my dear and good friend, etc., in Zurich.</p>
