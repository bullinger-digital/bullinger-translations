      <p> Greetings. You are not unaware, I believe, most esteemed lord and godfather, from the letters written to my brother, that after the death of our Artopoeus, Clauserus has been elected in his place. He has come these days and, having been confirmed again, is now in the process of arranging for his affairs to be transferred here. I hope he will be an ornament to this school. As for his behavior, I will restrain and control it as much as I can, so that he learns to adapt to the gravity of our people. As for the bearer of the present letter, he is, I believe, known to you, Hieronymus Massarius from Vicenza, who offered a certain small work dedicated to our most honorable senate, for which service he was given 15 crowns. He will stay for some time with Mr. Gessner. These days, Johannes Leonardus from Piedmont, who is undoubtedly also known to you, has come here; for he says he spoke to you there with you. He secretly approached the senate without the ministers, offered his book, which he calls the Versatile Sword of the Deity of Jesus Christ or even the two tablets of the evangelical law of grace, spirit, and life, and added a written supplication, claiming that all ministers are gravely mistaken about the greatest matters in Christian doctrine and requested that all ministers, both German and French, be summoned to Lausanne; there he would confirm these propositions in a public debate and also with miracles; for he claims to have been called immediately by Christ himself, who appeared to him three times, and that he did not write this book of his own accord, but under the dictation of the Holy Spirit (which the title of the book, printed in Basel by Johannes Parcum, also bears witness to). He was sent back to us by the senate. We discussed many things with him; but the poor man seems to lack all reason and is more to be despised than condemned. Among other things, he asserted that Mr. Pellicanus greatly approved of his book, but that you could not inspect it because of your business. However, after he persisted in stubbornly asserting his claims despite many admonitions, he was ordered by the senate to leave and not to return anymore. </p>
      <p> He lived for some time with Celio in Basel; but even he could not rid him of his absurdities. As for other new matters, we have nothing. Soldiers returned from Piedmont passed through here. On January 3rd, Sylvester Reid, a native of Augsburg but secretary to the Margrave of Brandenburg, was also here. He proceeds in the name of his prince to the new king with the intention of entering into an alliance against the Emperor (with Mr. Martin Peyer from Schaffhausen as interpreter, whom he takes with him); such is the loyalty and piety of men who follow the camp. He promises to seek the Emperor through Geldern next spring, if the French do the same through Picardy. It is reported that the marriage between the Queen and the Emperor's son has been confirmed among the English; but you will have more certain information about these matters. All of ours greet you. You will wish your wife and children a happy and prosperous year in my name and in the name of all of mine. We also wish you a long and happy life. </p>
      <p> Bern, January 5, 1554. </p>
      <p> Yours, Johannes Haller. </p>
      <p> To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his lord and venerable godfather. </p>
      <p> Zürich. </p>
