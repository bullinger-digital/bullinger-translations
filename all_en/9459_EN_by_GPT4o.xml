      <p>S. The reason I am sending you these conditions, arranged between the Polish Senate and the Prince of Anhalt, later than expected is not my fault, but that of Lord Amman Schuoler, who detained them longer than I had hoped. He himself, as well as the fellow ministers of our region, express their immense gratitude to you, especially for your great diligence in expediting our request concerning Mr. Abraham Sartorius. We all wish to reciprocate your kindness whenever the opportunity arises. It is a matter of astonishment to all who have examined these articles that such a distinguished prince wanted to purchase nothing more than the empty title of king at such a high price; for with that vain royal dignity, he has thrust himself into the greatest servitude. But it has been rightly dealt with him; for this fate, which we begrudge him from the bottom of our hearts due to his monstrous crime, he is not worthy.</p>
      <p>We are also amazed at the prolonged silence regarding our soldiers in France and hope that not everything is going according to their wishes, because if they had achieved favorable fortune so far, they would have made it known long ago and spread it throughout the world. If you have received any certain information, please let us know.</p>
      <p>All the brothers of our class wish you, our senior father and patron, a long and prosperous life, and we all pray to the Lord to kindly remove all adversities from you, to grant you health of both body and soul, and to preserve you as a faithful defender of His holy church. Amen.</p>
      <p>In haste. Glarus, 23rd September, 1573. Your Johannes Hugo.</p>
      <p>To the pious, venerable, well-learned Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Great Minster in Zurich, my faithful, dear lord and godfather.</p>
