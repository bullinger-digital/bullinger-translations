    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger should not thank Blarer excessively. After all, they want to maintain their friendship. - Bullinger has reassured Blarer regarding Konrad Curio [Hofherr]. Blarer has no doubt that under Bullinger's supervision, he will develop well. Bullinger should ensure that the easily distracted one stays on the right path. - Blarer does not know if and what Mayor [Johannes] Haab [wrote to Konrad Zwick regarding the negotiations on the art of war]. May God (whose plan it surely was that [the art of war] remained secret until now, to one day benefit Christendom) turn everything for the good. - Blarer would like to have Johannes a Lasco's letter to Bucer on the Lord's Supper, which [Albert] Hardenberg promised to send him in writing and also [Gerhard thom Camph]. Furthermore, he has not yet seen the writing by a Lasco mentioned by Bullinger [in a letter not received], the [„Defensio verae doctrinae“] against Menno [Simons]. - Blarer returns the „Dialogus [Philalethis“], which he liked very much. - The [Konstanz] bookseller [Gregor] Mangolt will probably travel to Augsburg in the next two days and deliver Bullinger's letter [not received] to [Georg] Frölich; otherwise, someone else will deliver it. - Thomas Grunder from Wil, with whom Blarer lived [in 1529] when he preached the Gospel there, asks Bullinger to help him acquire Zurich citizenship, as he can hardly live in Wil anymore due to the prevailing Papists. Grunder is not a bad person, but as a family man, he is somewhat negligent. - There is nothing noteworthy about the Diet [at Worms]. [Charles V.] is said to have departed on August 5th, without having achieved much. Everything was postponed to the future Diet [at Regensburg]. The Emperor could not adhere to the concessions made to the [Protestants at the Diet of Speyer] the previous year because of [Paul III.]. With the latter, he had indeed coaxed the money with which the [Protestants] made their friend [Francis I.] an enemy and helped their enemy [Charles V.]. [The Protestants], however, want to blindly hold on to the concessions. - Greetings. - Blarer recommends Jakob Metzler, the son of the [Konstanz] pastor [Bartholomäus Metzler], who is with Theodor [Bibliander], whom Bullinger should admonish if he meets him.</p>

      <p>You, my venerable and dearest Bullinger, are beginning to be burdensome with your excessive expressions of gratitude, therefore, I earnestly beg you to refrain from these in the future, and even more earnestly, that if you think there is anything of yours that I can properly take care of, you freely indicate it, as you will never find our service lacking. You are not unaware of the rights of friendship, and I have decided to cultivate them to the best of my ability.</p>
      <p>Regarding Konrad Curio, you have relieved me of great care and anxiety with your assurance, for I do not doubt that everything will turn out well for him, as long as you provide guidance and he accepts you as a mentor. Therefore, I beseech you greatly, as you have begun, to retain him, so that he does not deviate from the path of holy studies he has embarked upon (as it is easy to stray from them), but rather beautifully and perpetually meets the expectations placed upon him.</p>
      <p>What your consul Habius has replied to my cousin, or whether he has replied at all, I am completely ignorant. May the Lord turn everything for the good, whose singular counsel I believe has delayed the revelation of that truly remarkable secret until now, to be published, if I am not mistaken, one day for the great benefit of the Christian republic.</p>
      <p>I greatly desire to have the letter of Johannes a Lasco on the Lord's Supper. Hardenberg promised this in his last letters to me, and Frisius himself, as you know; and I think it was sent to Bucer. I have seen neither this nor the writing against Menno the Anabaptist, which you mention.</p>
      <p>I return the "Dialogus" with great thanks for sending it. It greatly pleased me for its unique craftsmanship and the knowledge of the matters it recalls.</p>
      <p>Our Mangold, the bookseller, affirms that he will set out for Augsburg tomorrow or the day after, who will deliver your letters to Leto. If by chance he changes his mind, nevertheless; there will be another opportunity to send them there.</p>
      <p>There is a certain citizen of Wil, named Thomas Grunder, with whom I stayed as a guest in previous years when I preached the Gospel of Christ there for several weeks. He earnestly entreats me to commend him to you, so that he may receive the right of citizenship in your city through your favor, since he suffers from the most severe hatred of the Papists who reign in Wil, and his affairs have come to the point of starvation.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I could not refuse this service and I ask you to assist him as much as you can without inconvenience. He is not a bad man, although not a very diligent head of the family.</p>
      <p>I can write nothing worthy of you about the Diet, since it has produced nothing worthy of such great heroes for us. The Emperor is said to have left Worms on the 5th of August, but without accomplishing such great things as it would have been fitting for him to achieve, serving the Antichrist against Christ; and everything has been postponed to future Diets, especially since the Emperor cannot adhere to those concessions through the Pope, by which he coaxed so much money from our people last year, with which we made France, which was friendly to us, an enemy, and strengthened him who was an enemy. Our people, however, absolutely wanted to retain those concessions. Oh, our blind ones, who do not finally bid a long farewell to all tyranny of the Antichrist and sing to the Savior Christ with full hearts, "Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord"! But farewell well with all yours, whom I greet most diligently with my words and those of mine. Pray for us. 10th of August 1545.</p>
      <p>I commend to you as accurately as I can Jacob Metzler, the young man, the son of our fellow pastor, who is still with the most excellent and learned man Theodor, so that sometime, if by chance you encounter him, you may exhort him to good conduct.</p>
      <p>To his very venerable and dearest brother, Heinrich Bullinger. Zurich.</p>
