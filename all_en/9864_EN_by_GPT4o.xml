      <p>Greetings. If you still have the letters I sent to Mr. Campell, I want you to open and read them; for they contain certain things that pertain to the weaving of Rhaetian history, or, if it seems appropriate, ask him in my name to let you read them as well.</p>
      <p>Indeed, if I had known you were dealing with this subject, I might have written differently. I encouraged him to complete the remaining part of his work, that is, to add history to the description of the region, as our Simler did in his Valais. I also added that it seems useful to me and others that he should strive for simplicity and brevity, not pursue every minute detail that is useless to the reader. What you write about families, I also wrote to him. Comparison among families is very odious. From ancient documents and family diplomas, as Stumpf did, antiquity can be assigned, also from public records of monasteries; for at the end, witnesses are usually added, as when it is said: when these things were done, the Salicaei, Prevostii, etc., were present. In documents, it is also diligently observed how individual places are named, mountains, villages, regions, as when you say Praegallia was once called the Breunia Valley. If you show from written documents that the region was called either Praegallia or Breunia Valley, which is today called Bergell, it will be appreciated; for most such names are invented by the more recent. Bishoprics have their indices, in which annual revenues are recorded, also individual villages, from which old names can also be sought. It would be beautiful to add authors. If you, who are skilled in style and judgment, intend to encompass the entire history of your people, perhaps it would be better for Mr. Campell to entrust the remaining part of his work to you; for you could make an honorable mention of him in your book and publicly profess that his labors have greatly benefited you in the making of that book. Or what if each of you strives to illustrate the affairs of his own country? What historical matters or materials are, I do not need to remind you, versed in Livy and other histories. Regarding the collection of material, in which there is greater difficulty, I will only say this: It would be useful to gather other chronicles from noble men. They will not hesitate to incite you, so that their origins may be celebrated; they will also show you their privileges. See what monuments of antiquity are among you, unearthed coins, tombs, inscriptions, trophies. From the books of life, as they call them, jahrzeitbüchern, urbaren, rödlen, privileges of communities and monasteries, many things can be sought. In monasteries, many books are kept that pertain to this; chapels are sometimes built here and there for certain reasons, either because some battle was fought there or something miraculous happened. Weapons, old instruments, which were used either in war or in idolatrous cults, are unearthed from the ground, showing that some battle was fought there or some temple existed. Certain customs and rites of peoples, etc., call past events to memory. Old songs, rumors pertain to this. But I do not doubt that you have diligently considered how the material for the history of your people should be collected. Many things can be learned from neighbors and others, and antiquarians, etc. In individual villages, there are people who can suggest certain things from letters or public documents, also recount what memorable things happened in those places, etc... The work of the royal orator can also be useful to you for the completion of history, to whom all nobles incite whatever he wishes. Gesner in his library says that Albert of Belfort described the deeds and nobility of the Rhaetian people, but the book does not exist; also that Mr. Stupanus wrote some books about the Rhaetians.</p>
      <p>Simonetta wrote a large book about the dukes of Milan; but whether he has anything about the Rhaetians, I do not know. Other Italian writers may have inserted certain things about your people in their books; it is certain about Guicciardini and Jovius. There are many learned and noble men among you who can greatly assist your efforts. At this fair, the German chronicle of Urstisii will be published about the affairs of the people of Basel, in which various things not yet read in others will be brought to light. For he has perused many books to adorn his history; if it will be pleasing to you, I will advise him to send you whatever he has. For I have great familiarity with him." Stumpf has many things," you say, "but not all." It will be useful, if he errs somewhere, to modestly point out the error. I also saw Tschudi's Rhaetia, much different from the former, which the king's orator could obtain for you from his heirs. It is a completely new book. What Simler writes about the people of Davos, he has from others. I want to note this from his opinion: Hence it seemed likely to him, what he writes, because they speak German and use the same phrase as the people of Valais, while almost all neighbors speak Rhaetian. The privilege of the Prevosts, which you write about, I saw last year with Mr. Funccius, who was asking for my judgment about it; with which there was also a separate picture (I had a copy with me), I ordered him to send it to me, so that I could compare it with it and later see how accurately each thing agreed with the chronology. But he did not send it; meanwhile, he made no further mention of it. I cannot affirm by whom or for what reason it was sent to him. What he writes about the Gugelberg family, he had from the man himself... a good man; for he wrote to Funccius, that we should inquire about those things in our histories. But we had nothing at all about them. Nevertheless, all these things were inserted into Mr. Campell's book at his suggestion. I also advised him on what seemed to be done, so as not to offend other families. There are many things among you that are well known to everyone, which others are amazed at. About the way of life, clothing, laws, and customs, our envoys, who were sent to you in previous years, reported amazing things, such as that women cut and chop wood in the forests, while here this is the work of men. But even the Swabians marvel at the Swiss milking cows, etc. The people of Davos, as a noble Rhaetian told me, were obliged to entertain the prince with a lavish banquet, that is, with fish and meat, but without bread and wine, if he came to them. From which it is inferred what their customs were at that time.</p>
      <p>It was most pleasing that you write about collecting those things that are known to the inhabitants of the mountains, but seem rare and wonderful to others who live in the plains. I wish you would preface that part to all others. It will certainly be the main part of your writing. For what occurs more frequently in Rhaetia than those things you write about? As a traveler, I often say that there are many and great wonders in the mountains. Indeed, it is a great thing that the mountains rise to such an incredible height. This part of your work would be useful for illustrating many places in scripture. Simler has accomplished much in his commentary on the Alps. I suggested not a few things to him; but I do not doubt that everything could be explained more clearly by you, born in the Alps. What can be said in general about the Alps, Simler seems to have encompassed all; yet perhaps some things could be corrected and explained about the name, height, routes, and the layout of the Alps, etc. Make sure to complete this chapter about the mountains briefly, in which you will also have about the hot springs, lakes on the mountain summits, and whether fish are found in some, as I have heard about some in the region of Abbatiscellarum; about the cataracts or torrents that fall from the highest mountains; about that torrent which flows around noon not with a full channel, which Campell mentions. How elegant that history would be and pleasant to read! The Greeks would have wonderfully illustrated all these things. Pertaining to this are caves, about which I have often heard many wonderful things proclaimed, also the narrowness of roads, passes, and that roads must be opened or cut through with iron.</p>
      <p>About avalanches, as you call them, or snow masses, which seem to be correctly described by none of the ancients (whether there is any description in Homer, I do not remember), you can have something more accurate than Simler.</p>
      <p>When the snows move, they are said to echo thunder, to move or run over a very long distance; they are also easily moved by a drum.</p>
      <p>I have often heard that those who are buried by snow live for some time, hear everything said by passersby and those who want to dig them out, but cannot move.</p>
      <p>To recount some examples (I heard some from the people of Glarus) how pleasing and acceptable it would be to the reader! I would like you to report something about the deep crevices of the ice beyond what Stumpf has, if you please. Pliny says that ice is preserved and used as a remedy, also thrown into wine vessels. Whether something similar is done today among you and the Italians, I would like to know, also whether it hardens into crystals; about opening the way here daily and how this is done; about pack horses, about dangerous Alpine journeys; how those who wish to travel through the snow should prepare themselves, so that they do not sit down when tired, for they immediately stiffen; how they use circles and what they are like (uff ryfften gan) in the highest snows, protect their eyes with spectacles; and if there are any of this kind.</p>
      <p>There are certain things peculiar to the Alps, that is, some things grow in the Alps and are not found elsewhere, certain mountain trees, ash, larch, yew, etc., there are shrubs, herbs, arnica. Daffodils, as I hear, grow in the mountains. Our Gesner wrote a special booklet about moonwort; Wolphius discusses aconite in Gesner's letters. Some things can also be extracted from Gesner's booklet about moonwort. Simler on fol. 132b about the Alps says that wild horses and bulls are found according to the stature of a deer. He does not specify which Alpine animal he is talking about; it will be your task to indicate this. What you write about the ibex, Capricorn, will be delightful. About the cervine wolf, about the horns of the ibex; whether they shed them like deer, which I do not think; how large they grow - I saw the largest in the castle of Haldenstein, which your father of blessed memory showed me -; how they are caught. About the sandy rocks they lick; they call it sulza. Stumpf writes known things about the Alpine mouse, but some things can be added. Also, what is read among the ancients, Pliny and others, can be corrected or added, whether those things are true and verified, or fabulous, which are read among them. If they are reported plainly from those authors, Pliny and Aelian, the reader doubts whether they report true or false things. About domestic animals, it could also be said, that goats, cows, horses, are raised in great and incredible abundance in those mountains; how they are led to pastures, how they return to stables, etc. About pastoral matters; whether all that is reported about bears by the ancients is true, also whether Alpine mice sleep, etc... It is strange that bears in Bern, as someone recently affirmed to us, give birth in December. Stumpf said pheasants are found in the Alps; Gesner denies it. But Stumpf does not speak of those found in great abundance around the Phasis, but of another kind, von bergfasanen. I would like you to note these in your writing; for both write correctly.</p>
      <p>White hares, like deer, are a wonder in other regions. Whether certain animals among you are white at a certain time of year, then change their whiteness, like hares, also whether white bears are found, the curious will want to know. I have heard wonderful things about snakes from our villagers, who are sometimes seen by hunters in sunny places; but I do not know whether I should count them among fables. For this kind of people freely lie, es seynd weydsprüch. You should not forget this, that there are no scorpions towards us, but many towards Italy. It will also be useful to report about insects, such as what is said about snow moths, how the common people name them, etc. Many also marvel at this, that dwellings or wine cellars are carved into the rocks, as I remember reading somewhere in Lambinus.</p>
      <p>It should also be noted that weather forecasts are obtained from the mountains. I almost overlooked this: among the wonders of the Alps, this must be entirely referred to, which was of great admiration to me when I was among you, das es gen Dafos im summer ein meyl oder zwo wyter ist dann im winter. Meanwhile, that village does not stand on the Monstenii, but on the left side. Many marvel at this. I have noted a little more extensively, to rouse you, so that you may satisfy me in these things, and others in other things. If learned foreign men come to you, who have traveled through the Alps, they will be able to recall many things to your memory, which they marvel at, but you do not, as they are daily before your eyes. When you have received something certain about the specter Ecco(?), make sure to inform me. For Mr. Vicar will not cease to bother me until he receives it. I suppose you have heard about the specter of Abbatiscellano, which began to be troublesome in the house of the neighboring priest after the death of the bishop of Vercelli, later came to the court and disturbed everyone by beating a drum. Farewell, my Pontisella.</p>
