      <p>May the grace of God be with you through our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
      <p>Even though, most reverend and dearest my lord and godfather, I have nothing that I consider worthy to cause you, who are otherwise occupied with various affairs, to waste time reading, except for this one thing, which was entrusted to me by the late Lord Joachim Beldius, of pious memory, when he was already at the end, to give to you. Know, therefore, that on the Sabbath day, which was the 29th of September, he happily passed away to God with a steadfast and sound confession of faith, and when shortly before his death I read to him your letters, which you had sent to me through my maid, he was very grateful for your final greeting to him, earnestly asking me to bid farewell in his name to you, Lord Haller, and the other most esteemed lords and brothers, and to wish both you all and the entire church of Zurich a happy progress and safety in Jesus Christ. He also praised the most sacred and truly prophetic institution and mandate of your republic and church, fervently beseeching God that true repentance may begin privately among individuals and publicly by the whole church of Christ, and that God may deign to hear the prayers of his people and graciously help all who are oppressed by famine and other calamities.</p>
      <p>And when he had said these things in the evening at twilight and prayed to the Lord God with clasped hands, looking up to heaven, he most holy passed away on a stormy night. I wanted to write this to you eight days ago; but on that day, our merchants departed at dawn beyond my opinion and expectation. Consider this kindly and keep me recommended to you and continue to inform me always about new matters that concern me to know.</p>
      <p>All good men, my wife, my maid, and all my children wish you well.</p>
      <p>Given in Glarus on the 10th of October in the year 71.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted son and godfather, Johannes Hug of Glarus.</p>
      <p>To the honorable, well-learned master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor at the Grossm√ºnster in Zurich, his faithful and very dear lord, father, and godfather, to his hands.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
      <p>"The death of the most excellent man, Lord Joachim Beldius, former bailiff of Glarus, my friend, September 1571."</p>
