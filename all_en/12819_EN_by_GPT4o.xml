    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Captain Bernhard von Cham, [bailiff] in Kyburg, had to make appropriate arrangements in Zurich as the commander-in-chief of the Zurich troops with the war delegates. After that, he visited Bullinger and told him about Haller's letter.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Von Cham will respond to Haller himself, but in the meantime, he asked Bullinger to convey that the desire [of the Zurich pastors in Augsburg] to be recalled is met with disapproval. With a letter to the Zurich council, they would only damage their reputation. Even Haller's letter to his father-in-law [Ulrich Kambli] has caused anger in the council. Accusations are already being made that the preachers are swaying with the wind and are the first to think of fleeing and their own well-being!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Haller should brace himself internally and not already think that death is imminent for him. And even if the Augsburg councilors [Emperor Charles V] were to make unworthy concessions, Haller should continue to fulfill his duties, as other good men do, who also do not join in the godless actions and will act according to the situation. If Haller then has to die, he should show steadfastness. In the case of an unjust peace, there will certainly be malicious tongues claiming that the decision for peace was made because the pastors proved to be fearful. But if the pastors are steadfast, their churches will also accept death. Haller should take courage, pray, and perform his duties bravely!</p>

      <p>S. D. The commander of our army, Bernhard von Cham, from Kyburg, arrived to take command and organize everything together with the war delegates. Once he had successfully completed this, he came to me and shared what you had written to him.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Although he himself promised to write to you, he nevertheless requested that I also inform you diligently, both in his name and in my own, that we are entirely displeased with your plan to be recalled. If you write to the esteemed council of Zurich, you will achieve nothing, and furthermore, you will tarnish your name (to speak in the manner of the scriptures) among both the pious and the impious, especially since your recent letter to your father-in-law has entirely displeased the council. There are already those who say that evangelical preachers are bold in fair weather, but timid in stormy times, and among the first to contemplate fleeing and looking after their own safety. You know what kind of people can be found even among the good ones.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>I therefore advise you in every way to harden your spirit against all dangers, so that you think of something other than dying in this matter. However, if they commit any indignity, do your part, as you seem to see the best do. They will not rashly plunge into impiety. They will also take care of themselves in due time. Then indeed, take counsel from the situation. But if it is necessary to perish, endure the fate bravely. The soul will not be killed, even if the body is slain. Eventually, the whole matter would fall upon you. For when unjust conditions have been accepted, there are indeed such malicious people who will dare to cast the blame on you, saying: "We agreed, but we first saw the leaders of the word fall from fear." But if you have encouraged the church according to your duty, it will bravely endure the danger and expose itself to death for the true religion. A good conscience will testify and just innocence will excuse. If you must fall, you fall gloriously! But if you act otherwise, you will fall even so, but with disgrace. Therefore, regain your spirit. Pray to the Lord. Proceed steadfastly and perform the duty of a brave man!</p>
