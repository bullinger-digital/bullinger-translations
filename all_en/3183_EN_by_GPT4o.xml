      <p>Greetings. I cannot write much now, as this messenger has just informed me at nightfall that he is going to Zürich. You will learn what has been done with the English from Mr. Lever's letters, which I am sending along with this. They have been given permission to seek residences in any part of the Bernese territory they wish, and they have been given an official document from the republic, which they can show anywhere. Here, as you know, no one is admitted, although if some wish to live here, I do not think it will be denied to them, but to receive them in such numbers will be difficult, and the city itself is not very spacious or abundant in necessary resources.</p>
      <p>Yverdon, a well-known town two miles above Neuchâtel on Lake Neuchâtel, is recommended to them by everyone because of the cloth-making craft practiced there. The same trade flourishes there, and all necessary materials for this craft are readily available, such as wool,..., water most suitable for dyeing cloth, mills, etc. I hope the citizens of that town will not be reluctant to receive them, with the mediation of our senate's authority; for they will learn to make better cloths from them. But about all this, Mr. Lever will undoubtedly write more extensively himself. He has set out with his companion to Basel to report this to his people. They will choose some to inspect several places and select those that seem suitable to them.</p>
      <p>All good people are surprised that the people of Basel have rejected them. This about them, more about others next time. Now, farewell. May your entire household and all the brothers be safe. Our people send their greetings to you.</p>
      <p>Bern, May 14, 1557.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church in Zürich, his most esteemed and dear lord and compatriot. Zürich. Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
