      <p>After I finished these, Mr. Christoph, the minister from Neuch√¢tel, who came here with his prince and is to preach here during these days while the prince is here, reports to me that in Paris, the Sorbonne theologians held a debate on whether it is permissible to obey a heretical king, and also whether it is permissible for pastors to advise subjects to rise against such a king and expel him from the kingdom [Affair Tanquerel Nov. 1561]. When the king learned of this, he imprisoned seven of those theologians; they were judged in parliament and sentenced to publicly recant, and to pray to God and the king for forgiveness. Since they refuse to do this, they are still being held in prison.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it was decreed that nothing more should be debated at the Sorbonne for three years. It was also reported yesterday that a certain noble and wise man came from Lyon, who testifies that throughout all of France, churches have been granted to the faithful and that in Paris there are very large and numerous congregations. Since these are new developments, I wanted to add them to the rest.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>You will also share this with my brother [Wolfgang Haller], to whom I do not know if I can write now.</p>
