      <p>Greetings. As I explained to you in my letter yesterday, dearest brother, I have reported the entire matter gathered from your letters to the honorable consul. He ensured that it was read today in a large and full senate. It was decided to send to you this Florin Gerster, our fellow citizen. He ordered me to give letters to you and to Mr. Tscharner; to Tscharner, I added another consul, Ambrosius Martin. The main points of what I write are these: It is understood from reports that there is a great dispute because of two bishops between you and the two Leagues, your confederates, with a judicial decision pronounced in favor of Beatus, while the House of God has appealed to the law, whether they themselves should pronounce in this matter. It is expected that in these days Beatus will be installed; the House of God, on the other hand, has convened a meeting on the 5th of May, etc. And although the most honorable magistrate of this city was ready to send two senatorial envoys to you, since the reports are varied, it seemed better to send this fellow citizen of ours to you. The most honorable senate requests that the consuls write to our consul clearly and how this whole matter stands; for ours are ready to seek what pertains to peace, etc. This is the main point. You, however, if you can advise anything in this matter, do so. Whatever you write back, make sure to write in German, so that ours can read it, etc. I have also reported the entire matter to the honorable consul in Bern; the messenger leaves today. I have also indicated that in several places exceptions are made, as I understood from yours. You see / I see that ours are very ready for pacification, so that the occasion for war may be cut off. Farewell excellently. I wrote in great haste; for the treasurer was pressing. 4th of May, 1566. Yours, Bullinger.</p>
      <p>I made no mention of yours, as I have them from you; therefore, do not be anxious in this matter. To the most excellent man, Mr. Johannes Fabricius, faithful minister of the Church of Chur, my esteemed and beloved compatriot and brother.</p>
