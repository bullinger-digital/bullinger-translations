    <p xml:id="regest1">Curione was just about to write to Bullinger (since B[éat] Comte intended to send a messenger to [Zurich]), when the letter [not received] and [book] gift [the "Brevis ἀντιβολή"] from Bullinger arrived. - The Zurich native Jakob [Kriech], who was staying with Comte and whom Comte was training in the sciences and medicine, has died of the plague. Comte mourns him more than his own biological son, also named Jakob, who died about eight days ago. [Due to the plague] Comte had to move. - Curione regrets the death of the [Zurich] mayor [Diethelm Röist] and is relieved that a good successor [Hans Rudolf Lavater] has been elected. - Cochläus will always remain a snail (coclea), or perhaps a one-eyed "Cocles", if not completely blind! May the Lord open his spiritual eyes! Curione will forward Bullinger's [“Brevis ἀντιβολή”] to the already informed Comte after reading it. - Luther remains the same. The [inner-Protestant] disputes delight the enemies and endanger the still-growing church, unless the Lord takes care of it and the Zurichers respond to Luther with the moderation that befits learned and pious men. - Bullinger wishes Curione to translate the "Responsio" into Italian and Comte into French. Is this the response to Cochläus or to Luther? Bullinger should note that translations could further inflame the situation. Comte and the other brothers also find it advisable to respond to the German-writing [Luther only] in German. However, if Luther continues [with his attacks], the Zurichers are free to publish their discussions in various languages. Curione would be available for an immediate translation. - He cannot thank [Bullinger's "Brevis ἀντιβολή"] in an appropriate manner. He would have sent his writings published in Basel in recent months if they could withstand a comparison with Bullinger's works. Nevertheless, he sends his insignificant "Araneus". - He requests the sending of Zwingli's works against payment. - Curione's wife [Margarita Bianca, née Isacchi] and sons [Horatio, Leo, and Augustin] fondly remember Bullinger's wife [Anna, née Adlischwyler] and children. - Greetings to [Konrad] Pellikan, [Kaspar] Megander, [Theodor] Bibliander, [Rudolf] Gwalther, [Konrad] Gessner, [Johannes] Fries, and to the young Peter Soler from Rapperswil, who was a guest with Bullinger and then with Curione. - May Bullinger convey news from Zurich from time to time. Curione recommends the young letter carrier Jakob [...]. - On January 18, the day Bullinger's letter arrived.</p>

      <p>Caelius Secundus Curio to Heinrich Bullinger, the most learned and holy Antistes of the Church of Zurich, sends greetings through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>I was just preparing a letter to your holiness, and behold, yours, along with the splendid gift, was delivered to me, bringing me great joy. For B[eat] Comte, our most distinguished brother, indicated that he would soon send a messenger there, who delivered these letters to you. Thus, nothing could have been more timely or pleasant for me than your letters, especially since I understand that you and your pious and holy family are well (thanks be to Christ).</p>
      <p>As for your concern about our safety, you are indeed kind; however, the Lord has preserved us all unharmed so far, and the plague has not spread very widely, although it pleased the Lord to take Jacob of Zurich, a young man of great promise who was staying with Comte, not without great sorrow for all of us and a great longing for him, especially for B[eat] Comte.</p>
      <p>For he loved him so and constantly cultivated him in good letters and medical reading, as if he were his own and true son, so that nothing seemed to have happened more grievous than the death of this young man. This was clear enough to us, for when, a few days later, about eight to be precise, his son, who was also named Jacob, was taken by the same plague, he did not seem to grieve as much, nor was his face as squalid as it was and is due to the longing for Jacob of Zurich, although he also felt many and serious inconveniences in his family affairs. And it was necessary for Comte, for the sake of his own safety, to move elsewhere, where he still is, and we trust the Lord will preserve him for us.</p>
      <p>As for the death of your consul, a pious, wise man who served your republic well, I have taken it as gravely and with as much distress as I should, although I am greatly comforted that you have chosen another, equally wise, good, and vigilant, for whom we pray to the Lord for a long life.</p>
      <p>But Cochläus (as I see) will always be a snail and a slug, nothing more than a worthless shell and a sordid belly. I fear he may truly be a Cocles, and would that he were only a Cocles (for he would at least have one eye) and not completely blind, since he sees nothing even at midday! Jesus Christ, that heavenly physician, should be prayed to, that he may open the eyes of his mind, so that he may perceive the truth that daily presents itself before his eyes; if only he is one of those who seem to be curable. I will do as you command; after I have read your book, in which you strive to cure Cochläus's madness, I will hand it over to B[eat] Comte to read in your name, even if I have already informed him of everything and he thanks you. But since he is sending a messenger, I do not doubt that he will write to you.</p>
      <p>There is nothing new about Luther; for he remains the same, and I fear that he may rage until death, which omen that pious father (Gott) may avert, lest the enemies of true piety and religion grow insolent from his bad example and our dissensions, and our church, still a tender young maiden, be corrupted, and if any fruit lies hidden in the joyful herbs, it may be consumed by this Stygian rust before it matures or, just as it is about to mature, be completely shaken and perish by the force and fury of this calamity; which is greatly to be feared unless the Lord provides and you respond to Luther with the moderation that befits men of such holiness, piety, learning, and wisdom as you all possess; which I do not doubt you, most devoted to peace and concord, will do, and the others will follow.</p>
      <p>As for your wish that I translate your response into Italian and B[eat] Comte into French, I do not quite understand which response you mean: the one to Cochläus, which you sent, or the one in which you respond to Luther's booklet? If you inform us of which you speak, we will comply with your wishes. But see, my lord (for I will speak freely and frankly with you), lest, if it is translated into so many languages, a greater fire be kindled; for if you mean Luther, it would be far more prudent (as it seems to me, and as pleases Comte and the other brothers) if you respond in German to the German-writing Luther, and foreign nations and languages remain ignorant, which they cannot learn without danger and great trouble. Your wisdom is clear enough, and you remember (for your memory of all antiquity is most excellent) how much the fame of dissensions vexed and almost destroyed those ancient holy and most noble churches, which never spread without ruin.</p>
      <p>Therefore, my advice is that what can scarcely benefit, but can greatly harm the common cause, be omitted for the present. But if Luther persists and wishes the world to know these things, and it seems worthwhile to you, the matter will remain intact for you to illustrate your discussions in various languages. You will always have me ready, to whom you can entrust anything. But if it is entirely decided by you that you wish it to be translated as soon as possible, send it; there will be no delay on my part, but I will comply with your wishes (as I should), even if I must set aside all my own affairs.</p>
      <p>As for the pious and learned gift, there is no need for me to thank you, for your benefits to me are greater than I can express in words. The thanks I cannot express in words, I have and will have as long as I live.</p>
      <p>I would have sent you my little books, which were published in Basel in recent months, if I had thought them worthy to be read by you, and if they could in any way be compared to your most divine writings. However, so that this messenger does not come to you entirely empty-handed, I have added our "Araneus" to these letters, which you will accept as a little spider (as it certainly is), that is, a slight and almost worthless thing. Yet do not judge my spirit towards you by the gift, which is indeed most ample, if any opportunity is given to gratify you.</p>
      <p>I will not hesitate to ask you this, my Bullinger, which I greatly desire, namely, that you ensure Zwingli's works, when they are published, are sent to me along with the price itself, which will be sent by me immediately afterward. For I know no other way or means by which I can obtain them. And if there is anything else new, if you will deign to ensure it is sent to me, the price will be repaid by me and gratitude will be held.</p>
      <p>My wife and my sons cannot forget your most holy and kind wife and your children, than whom nothing could be more charming; therefore, you will greet them all diligently in her name. As for myself, what can I say, who am what you wished me to be? Therefore, I am yours both by bond and by ownership, and also, whenever you wish, by use.</p>
      <p>I ask you to greet my lords and most beloved brothers, Konrad Pellikan, the venerable old man, Kaspar Megander, Theodor Bibliander, Rudolf Gwalther, Konrad Gessner the physician, Johannes Fries, and others; nor will you, I pray, pass over that good young man who was staying with you, and also my guest, if the occasion arises, Peter Soler from Rapperswil.</p>
      <p>May the Lord always be with you, my brother and lord, and keep you safe for his church for a long time, and if you can, write to me about your affairs from time to time, which you can do more easily, as you have many ways by which you can send letters. I, a foreigner, scarcely know one or two, yet I will not pass up opportunities. I commend to you the messenger of Comte, this young Jacob, learned, pious, and good, our brother. Farewell through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>In Lausanne, on the 18th day of January, on which day I received yours, 1545. The brothers who are with us in the Lord greet you.</p>
      <p>To the singularly pious and learned Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant Antistes of the Church of Zurich, lord and brother to be revered. In Zurich.</p>
