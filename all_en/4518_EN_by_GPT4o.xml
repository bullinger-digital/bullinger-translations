      <p> S. I have received your letters written on the 20th and 23rd of this month, and I can hardly be persuaded to believe that the princes of the Augsburg Confession have left Stuttgart without first discussing the counsel and the times of religion. God is the one who governs the hearts of princes, and He is stronger than the world and Satan, nor will He abandon His own, to whom He has granted such great benefits; He will crush the already too much incited and exultant ferocity. What I understand about the preparations for war, which is the least necessary of all in Switzerland, I bear gravely, as I should, and with displeasure. However, I hope that good and prudent men, who are in each Canton, will leave nothing undone so that everything is settled, lest they become a laughingstock and be exposed to the injuries of those who wish them ill. I have indeed taken it upon myself to warn everyone and to reveal the dangers into which they are throwing themselves, and since I will not be able to attend the assemblies, I will send one of the king's interpreters with sufficiently detailed letters, which should affect, soothe, and move even the most barbarous. I have heard that Bolweiler borrowed money from the people of Basel, not to gather soldiers, but to repay ten thousand florins to the lords of Rinach, to whom he had pledged the land of Florimont near Montb√©liard. But no efforts prevail against the Lord or His own. </p>
      <p> I believe the French disturbances have subsided and that the King of Navarre will do what is fitting for him without danger. I do not doubt that Philip has offered Spanish soldiers to the king, but there will be no need, nor would it be in the interest of the Kingdom of France to accept them. I also think the Spanish legation will not impede the national council. </p>
      <p> The Pope wants the Council of Trent to continue, which the Christian princes do not approve. </p>
      <p> Sanlaurentianus, as you know, is negligent in writing; I am expecting his letters and will inform you about the affairs of France and everything that will be worthy. You will do the same. </p>
      <p> I am writing to the host of Ciconia to always include your letters and those of others in another paper and to put the address in German so that they are delivered to me more quickly; if I did not think he would do this and send them immediately upon receipt, I would entrust this business to another, who would also receive a stipend. I send greetings to friends with interest. Farewell well. </p>
      <p> Solothurn, 27th of October. </p>
      <p> Yours sincerely, Coignet. </p>
      <p> I have learned that eight insignia of landsknechts have been gathered around Lake Constance... one led by Embs and against the Genoese. After writing this, I recalled more what you wrote and what the majority of the Swiss decided. Therefore, I have entirely resolved to set out for Baden tomorrow, where I will leave nothing undone that will be suitable for maintaining and achieving peace. There it will be pleasant for me to receive letters from you. </p>
      <p> To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the divine word of the city of Zurich, his favorable, dear friend. Zurich. </p>
