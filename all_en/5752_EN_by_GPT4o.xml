      <p>Four days ago, I returned to Leutmerken from Winterthur, from where I wrote to you once and again anxiously, waiting for your response, especially regarding that matrimonial matter, about which perhaps even our Bernhard has conferred with you, as well as about the censure.</p>
      <p>Concerning that alliance to be made with the French, let me know what you think, do not keep it from me.</p>
      <p>I now have nothing at all worth knowing to write. Regarding the conscripted soldiers, everything is now also quiet among the people of Constance.</p>
      <p>May the Lord grant us His, that is, solid and eternal peace. Farewell again and again.</p>
      <p>Leutmerken, 4th of June, 1542.</p>
      <p>May your household be well with all friends and brothers.</p>
      <p>Y[ours] Ambr[osius] Bl[arer].</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious Mr. H[einrich] Bullinger, his very esteemed and dearly beloved brother, etc.</p>
