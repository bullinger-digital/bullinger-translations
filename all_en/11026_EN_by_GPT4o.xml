    <p xml:id="regest1">Reports on an uprising [the "Pilgrimage of Grace"], which, contrary to Bullinger's assumption, aimed not at the promotion but at the suppression of the Gospel; it was initiated by priests and monks who feared for their privileges and was supported by uncivilized and marauding people, especially those living in the border area with Scotland. The King [Henry VIII] gathered a large army to test the loyalty of his subjects, but was able to quickly suppress the rebellion with a small part of the troops; the rebels were pardoned with few exceptions. Thanks to this war, resistance to the Gospel has decreased; similar to [in Germany] after the Peasants' War, the reorganization of church affairs is now under favorable auspices. The demands of the insurgents were: reintroduction of the papacy and its heresies; prohibition of the writings of Luther, Melanchthon, Oekolampadius, and all Germans; restitution of the monasteries; extradition of Cranmer and the bishops of Worcester [Hugh Latimer], Rochester [John Hilsey], and Salisbury [Nicholas Shaxton].</p>

      <p>Letter from the Archbishop of Canterbury to Heinrich Bullinger. It remains for me to recount to you some matters concerning our affairs, which, although the talkative rumor may have already spread to you, I believe you will be glad to learn more accurately from me. Here, indeed, it is worth admiring whether you have written anything that you have felt and received from others, or whether you have truly received it; that there was a tumult among us for the restoration of the evangelical doctrine - for so you write - when in fact it is true that the tumult arose for its suppression, which was more terrifying than dangerous. For the unlearned priests and monks, who were dead not to the world, as they should have been, but rather to God, who lived splendidly and almost royally from the darkness and ignorance of men, when they saw that with the rising light their kingdom and gain were not so much decreasing as utterly vanishing, they were the first to sound the alarm against this evil, to which many easily listened, who turned their minds back to the flesh pots of Egypt and who, with disdain for the word of God, the purest wheat, aspired more to the acorns and swine's food to which they had once become accustomed. Added to them was a certain barbarous and savage kind of people, who are ignorant of and averse to agriculture and all other good arts of peace, and who are so alien to the knowledge of divine things that they cannot bear to hear anything even of gentler humanity and civility, such as England has in some of its peoples, whom I think I should more rightly call depredators, from its farthest parts to the border with Scotland, who with the neighboring peoples on both sides wage perpetual wars and robberies in the ancient manner and live solely on the spoils and plunder acquired from there. From these three kinds of people was formed that nefarious and Catilinarian army, which was striving to bring sword and fire to the country. Against whom the most vigorous king at the beginning had enlisted a huge and scarcely credible army in the space of a few days, namely of two hundred thousand men, not because he thought he needed such forces, but to test the loyalty of his other subjects. When he found them ready at his nod and obedient to his word, he again selected scarcely one in a hundred from them, sending the rest home with thanks. Thus, with that indeed less numerous, but most valiant and well-equipped band of soldiers, they went against the rebels, whom they could have cut down to extermination, had they not surrendered and the most merciful prince preferred to save his own, even those deserving to perish, rather than destroy them. Therefore, having become supplicants, they all easily obtained pardon, except for a few who suffered punishment on the crosses as an example. Thus, this war was concluded in such a way that, however much the nature of the matter resists, it can indeed be called a beautiful thing, if you consider its outcome, which I, considering with myself, am so far from being angry with its first authors that I would even give thanks, if I did not know that all thanks are due to God, who turned their wicked plans to a very different outcome. For with the rebels pacified and triumphed over, the prince's own mind seems to be more strongly and seriously inclined in favor of the Gospel than ever before. And the nobles, who were previously slow to believe and, so to speak, heavy-hearted, have now begun to be more attentive to listening and in all things more equitable and favorable. Finally, you can see the bishops themselves and the leaders of the faction, of whom too many still remain, whose stiff and inflexible necks we thought, now looking down to the ground and opposing us less. In short, just as that tumult of the peasants brought solid peace to you, so we also have hope that it will be so for us. For by the prince's command, the bishops and more learned men have again convened in council to discuss the constitution of ecclesiastical matters, in which we act more freely than ever before, and (as I hope) will accomplish with greater fruit. But the outcome will declare, which, whatever it may be, will soon become known to you, if not from elsewhere, certainly from me. In the meantime, accept the demands of those fanatical rebels. The first was that the Roman pontiff be restored to his place with his laws and errors concerning purgatory, the worship of saints, pilgrimage to the images of the saints, the seven sacraments, and sacramentals; the second, that the doctrines and writings of Luther, Melanchthon, Oekolampadius, and all Germans be condemned and expelled; the third, that all things be restored to the religious; finally, they demanded me and the bishops of Worcester (Hugh Latimer), Rochester (John Hilsey), Salisbury (Nicholas Shaxton), briefly and all whom they thought had favored the Gospel above others, to be sought for punishment, as heretics to be condemned, none of whom they had ever heard preaching. These are the things which I have thought fit to write to you at present. Help us with your prayers to God as we strive with utmost effort and danger. And may you fare well. Given at Lambeth, in the suburb of London, on the third day of April, 1537.</p>
