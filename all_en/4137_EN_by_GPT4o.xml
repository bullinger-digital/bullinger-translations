      <p>To the most esteemed Lord Bullinger, Friedrich von Salis sends greetings.</p>
      <p>A few days ago, I wrote to you, most esteemed Lord Bullinger, and now I have nothing to add to that; for we are doing quite well, and everything in our Rhaetia is safe by the grace of God. I did not attend the recent Chur fairs due to the whirlwind of my affairs; I was waiting to hear some news from them to inform you, but I understood nothing at all and am glad for it; for the less we hear of new things, the better we are. May the Lord God continually deign to prosper our happy state.</p>
      <p>I have heard nothing certain about the creation of the Antichrist, although there were those who asserted that the Cardinal of Mantua had taken control of affairs. The Venetians have increased their garrisons everywhere throughout their dominion.</p>
      <p>In the Duchy of Milan, as reported, about 3000 Spanish soldiers have been enlisted and are divided here and there into winter quarters. What this preparation of foreign soldiers means is uncertain, and opinions differ; but I believe they are the remnants of the army that has been campaigning in Piedmont for several years, and since they cannot conveniently cross to Spain at this stormy time for sailing, they are divided into winter quarters to remain in service and not wreak havoc on the subjects here and there, and should be returned to Spain next spring. I have received no news about your son Christopher, and it has been a long time since I received any letters from Venice at all; but if I receive anything, I will immediately forward it to you. It remains for you to be well with all yours and to keep me continually in your thoughts.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again, and most happily. My son Johannes, who diligently attends the school here, sends his regards to you and wishes you and your entire family the best. Please also convey my warmest regards to the venerable elders Mr. Peter Martyr and Mr. Bernardino Ochino, all your sons-in-law, and your co-father-in-law Mr. Walther, men indeed distinguished in many respects.</p>
      <p>Farewell eternally once more.</p>
      <p>Given at Chiavenna, November 27, 1559.</p>
      <p>Lord Francesco Negro moved here from Tirano a few days ago, as to a more pleasant and healthier place. The illustrious lady Isabella is doing somewhat well, and Mr. Augustinus Maynardus, as much as his advancing age allows, is also well, and they all send you their best regards. The same as above, your most devoted Friedrich von Salis, commissioner of the County of Chiavenna. To the most honorable and illustrious Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed lord. Zurich, Switzerland.</p>
      <p>To the highly and well-learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, preacher at the Grossm√ºnster, my especially favorable, dear lord. In Zurich.</p>
