    <p xml:id="regest1">Blarer handed over a detailed letter [No. 2489] for Bullinger to [Konrad] Hofherr yesterday. Today, just this.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">- Recently, 15 Confederates wanted to cross the bridge to Kempten. There, they recognized five imperial soldiers and insulted them with derogatory terms. The latter immediately fled. But this is just a joke! [Konrad] Zwick wanted Blarer to tell Bullinger this story in this way. In reality, it was different: 15 imperial soldiers recognized five Swiss heading to Kempten and insulted them. Consequently, they were immediately chased away by the Swiss.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">- An imperial bailiff [...] came to Kempten with 20 horses and checked into an inn. When he came out, some riders (as is customary) spurred their horses to gallop. One drove his horse against the standing Swiss and injured one of them. A fight ensued, during which the riders were chased out of the city and nearly killed.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">- The Schmalkaldic allies gathered in Ulm were prompted by these rumors to forbid the people of Kempten from allowing imperial [soldiers] to stay with them in the future. [These stories] are probably signs of an imminent victory!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">- Blarer will continue to faithfully report news. The [Zurichers] should pray for the [German Protestants].</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">- [P.S.:] It is said that the Confederates are at odds because of their mercenaries who have joined the [Germans], and that a messenger [...] is on the way to recall them. If that is true, Blarer has already suspected it. May God turn everything for the good!</p>

      <p>Yesterday, I sent everything to you through Curio; but so that there is not nothing at all, here is this for you.</p>

    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>Recently, five imperial soldiers stood on the bridge in Kempten, and fifteen Confederates came along.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>They wanted to enter the city. And when they seriously confronted the imperial soldiers, they said: "By my wounds, these are more tailors!" etc. Then the five drew their weapons and drove the fifteen Swiss back into flight, so that their shoes fell off and they were badly wounded. But consider this a joke from me. You should simply understand everything as it is, and you will understand the reality. Zwick wanted it told this way as a joke. The Swiss were five and the others were fifteen. They said: "By my martyrdom, these are Swiss!" The other replied: "Oh, they are tailors!" Then the five prepared well for them as above. Also, an imperial bailiff rode into Kempten with 20 horses. He checked into an inn. When he wanted to leave again, some soldiers, as is customary, mounted their horses and galloped into the streets. But three or five Swiss stood together. A soldier spurred his horse and behaved as if he wanted to gallop through the Swiss. They said: "Now stand still!" But he pressed so hard on them that his horse stepped on one Swiss's foot, whereupon he and the others drew their weapons and struck and stabbed at him and his horse. The other riders also immediately pressed on them, etc., and other Confederates who stood around also ran to help their own. They harassed, stabbed, struck, and wounded the soldiers so much that they escaped with difficulty to the city. And if other people had not intervened, they would have been completely finished off.</p>

    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Because of this, the people of Kempten were written to by those in Ulm, where our people are now gathered, that they should not allow any more imperial soldiers in, so that there is no daily cause for such disturbances, etc. These are not bad signs, if I am not mistaken, of imminent victories.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Otherwise, nothing new at this time. But we are waiting every hour to hear more from our people. Then I will write to you further. Earnestly and faithfully praying for us and our people, that they all have brave hearts. July 9th.</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>There is a rumor flying here about the soldiers who have left yours, that the Confederates in Baden have become very divided over the matter, and a messenger is hastily riding to recall them in the most serious and urgent manner. If that is the case, this is exactly what my mind had previously foreseen. May the Lord turn everything for the good!</p>
      <p>To his Bullinger. In Zurich.</p>
