      <p>S. Pl. in Christo. Your letters were very welcome to me, my father and most esteemed lord in Christ, either because they were from you, to whom I attribute everything, or because they seemed somewhat delayed and complaining and required my duty. Indeed, I acknowledge the fault and ask for forgiveness; for it is better to act thus than to try the utmost law, although I do not doubt that I have a defense, even if it were before the strictest judge. First, I am far from London; then Johannes Abel, the common manager of our affairs, has passed away; finally, these Belgian disturbances have been hindering travel for several years now, so that neither our merchants can go to Antwerp nor the people of Antwerp to us. Our letters are often left behind on the journey, often taken elsewhere, often returned, often lost, and what will happen to these very ones I am now writing, God will see. This certainly is the reason why I write to you less frequently than I would like, and more sparingly and cautiously.</p>
      <p>Whatever it is, I rejoice that your affairs are in the state you write. May God send you help from the sanctuary and protect you from Zion! For your enemies are no less fierce and numerous at this time than ours; for it seems that the Antichrist has now completely cast all his dice and has mixed the world with seditions, tumults, wars, madness, fires, and conflagrations. He sees that it is already declared, and that destruction and ruin are imminent for him and his followers. Therefore, the wretched one now acts so that he does not perish ignobly or obscurely. May the memory of them perish with a sound.</p>
      <p>What was commonly rumored among you about a change in our state was nothing. For our queen, by the grace of God, holds the empire, and religion is in the place it was and where we want it. However, our papists, with Pope Pius as their advisor and instigator, had proposed to take everything for themselves. But blessed be our God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, for while they seek to destroy others, they themselves perish! Two of our earls, both young, foolish, indebted, and ruined, who cared more for gambling than religion, enlisted several thousand peasants in the farthest parts of England at the end of autumn. Relying on that multitude, those most frivolous men even dared to publish edicts, wanting, I know not whom (for they named no one), to remove from the queen's sacred council and restore the ancestral religion. What do you ask? No delay. Altars are raised in the camps, sacred bibles are burned: masses are said.</p>
      <p>After a few weeks, the Earl of Sussex, a good and vigorous man of great counsel, is sent against them with a small force.</p>
      <p>They gradually retreat and withdraw. Sussex prudently and sharply pursues and presses the retreating. In the end, the wretched, seeing the enemy with hostile standards threatening them, men inexperienced in matters, who had never seen an enemy before, not daring to try the fortune of war, struck by the consciousness of their crime, mad and blind, abandon the army without a leader, and leaving the camps, flee secretly by night with a few to Scotland. You have the story of our affairs, of which I cannot remember without shame: for it is a disgrace that there were ever in our England either so cowardly or so foolish. Our queen, through her orator, demands the rebels back from Scotland. There are at this time two factions in Scotland. For some honor pure religion and the gospel, and depend on us; others abhor piety, and rather favor papism, and incline towards the French. The leader of these is Duke Hamilton, a man, as they say, much more powerful in name than in counsel.</p>
      <p>The senate is convened; deliberation begins: our people think they should be returned, the Hamiltonians refuse. In the end, the Hamiltonians prevail.</p>
      <p>Our people, impatient of injury, arm the soldiers, and having advanced into the middle of Scotland, with no one resisting, plunder the castles and towns of Duke Hamilton in a hostile manner. Those excellent warriors of ours, whom I mentioned, when they could no longer hold themselves in Scotland, fled to Flanders. There they now linger with the Duke of Alba and cause as much trouble as they can.</p>
      <p>All these disturbances were given to us by the most holy father. For he, in his holiness and wisdom, had sent a bull (should I say golden or leaden?) of great weight into England to his followers. It was carried secretly among a few for several months. The good father signified, namely, that Elizabeth, Queen of England, was not queen; for her institutions did not please him: therefore, he commanded that no one should recognize her as a ruler, nor obey her commands; whoever did otherwise, he devoted to all curses and destruction. O holy seat! Thus, indeed, Peter used to act. There were otherwise those to whom these things seemed sacred: the rest were not so pliable to all the nods of the pope, nor had they so unlearned the gospel. I send you a copy of that most putrid and vain bull, so that you may understand how solemnly and shamelessly that beast raves at this time. In these last days, new disturbances have begun in Norfolk: but the authors were immediately captured at the first opportunity and thrown into prisons.</p>
      <p>The Queen of Scotland, a fugitive from her country, is kept, as you know, with us; indeed, quite honorably, but yet in such a way that she cannot stir up disturbances. This is the one to whom Pope Pius not only promised Scotland but also England: for he hopes that a Catholic woman, the murderer of her husband, and an adulteress, will bring great weight to restore papism. We arm a fleet, and we have soldiers ready. Otherwise, our church, by the grace of God, is peaceful. Dr. Grindal has been made Archbishop of York; Dr. Sandys, who was previously of Worcester, is now made Bishop of London.</p>
      <p>Parkhurst of Norwich lives and is well: I have not seen him for a whole six years now. May God preserve you for a very long time for the use of the gospel and his church!</p>
      <p>Greet in my name Dr. Gwalther, Dr. Simler, Dr. Lavater, Dr. Zwingli, Dr. Wick, Dr. Haller, and your Bullingers, whom I love in the Lord.</p>
      <p>From the journey: for I am now going about my province, August 7, 1570.</p>
      <p>Yours in Christ, John Jewel, Bishop of Salisbury.</p>
      <p>To the most learned and illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the church of Zurich, let these be delivered.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
