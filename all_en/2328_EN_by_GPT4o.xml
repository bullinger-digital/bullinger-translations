      <p>Greetings. A young man is traveling there, my dear Bullinger, with the hope of obtaining your alms. He would not have been excluded here either, if the almoners had not forbidden that it be given to many from one nation, and since several from Sion enjoy that benefit here, he seeks support elsewhere.</p>
      <p>He is a pious and noble young man, so I do not doubt that whatever is given to him will not be bestowed on an unworthy person.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I commend him to you and the other brothers. The plague, which had recently become quite strong, seems to be abating somewhat. Of the fellow brothers and professors of the school, except for the son of Mr. Johannes Huber, no one has been affected so far by God's grace, whom I pray will continue to mercifully look upon the church and grant the grace that, recognizing the kind scourge, we may turn to repentance worthy of our profession. What our Bernese have accomplished with the Savoyard in the meeting held at Nyon is not yet clear to me; unless there is agreement and settlement on religion, peace, which is greatly to be desired at this time, will hardly be obtained.</p>
      <p>The army that Marcus von Ems is gathering, although it is not known for certain where it is directed, many suspect it is being assembled at the expense of the Pope and Philip to attack the religion of the gospel and impose the impious decrees of the Council of Trent, which, like other councils, will have the usual result, namely wars and slaughter. It is certain that Satan will turn his utmost strength to the subversion of piety; but he will meet with confusion if we are strong and steadfast in faith in Him who has overcome the world. The state of France still seems uncertain; the king grants many things to the papists and is engaged in nothing else but hunting, boxing, and attending mass, and, most gravely, he is governed and influenced by a man, as they say, of the worst kind. Condé and Admiral are said to be absent from the court. In Lyon, four churches are being built by our people with remarkable zeal; the same is happening in Dauphiné and other places, after the papists yield all their things. Farewell with all yours. Basel, July 2, 1554.</p>
      <p>Your Sulzer.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed and beloved brother, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Antistes of the Church of Zürich, with doctrine and piety.</p>
