      <p>S. D. That Gallus, to whom you entrusted the letters on November 4th, delivered them faithfully and promptly enough. Now also, as I sat down to write this, those letters you wrote in Wittenberg on February 1st were conveniently brought from St. Gallen by Bartholom√§us Steck. Therefore, I thank the Lord, who prospers our affairs, and I urge you to fear God and pray frequently, and to remember the teachings written by my hand and given to you. As for the rest, consider this: I am compelled to conclude everything briefly due to the turmoil of business.</p>
      <p>The lectures please me, the teachers please me; therefore, continue and be diligent in the Greek and Latin languages so that you do not forget theology. Exercise is especially necessary, as it instructs the most. Therefore, I want you to write, declaim, dispute, and read day and night. Beware, lest you are ruined by companions, that you do not become a loafer and beer drinker. I like the companions, the Collin brothers, whom you will greet from me, and I will not be ungrateful for their kindness and benefits towards you. Beware of excessive expenses. I want you to record and send the account of your affairs at each Frankfurt fair, as you used to from Strasbourg. If I see you are frugal and diligent, I will willingly add an increase of 40 gold coins, and indeed a necessary one. I do not want you to be in need, nor do I want you to contract diseases from filth and then spend more on doctors; however, I require sobriety and frugality. I do not want you to go to Melanchthon's house; I do not want to increase his envy among those who hate us through you.</p>
      <p>I fear too great expenses, and lest you be troubled by the wealthier ones there. You will give him letters and two copies, one of the Summa, the other of the Apology. So see to it that you diligently take care of the letters and two copies to Rostock for Philip's advisor, Dr. David. Keep and read the remaining two for yourself. If it could be done without great expense and safely and conveniently, I would wish for you to see Rostock, to greet Chytraeus, to whom I have commended you, and to see the Baltic Sea there. If you cannot act conveniently in Wittenberg due to envy (for I fear that my response might irritate those who are otherwise irritable), go directly to Marburg to Dr. Andreas Hyperius, who offers you lodging.</p>
      <p>However, I do not want you to leave there without Philip's advice, unless you cannot stay in Wittenberg, unless you have received testimonial letters. If wars break out, use the advice of Philip and good men. There is no need for you to send me any books; for I have long had those you wanted to send. For these letters alone, I paid the St. Gallen merchant 3 batz. In the meantime, I do not want you to spare expenses regarding letters, so that I always know how you live.</p>
      <p>They are conveniently delivered by Steck from Leipzig. I have instructed Froschover to send you money and a dictionary; I ordered him to send 22 thalers, which, if added to the 20 given in autumn, will make about 45 guilders. Your mother, brother, sisters, and brothers-in-law greet you; your uncle is very miserable, Brigida. I cannot say more. Fear God, pray diligently, be diligent, modest, grateful to God and men.</p>
      <p>Farewell, dearest son.</p>
      <p>Zurich, March 14, 1556.</p>
      <p>Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To my beloved son Heinrich Bullinger, Swiss from Zurich, residing in Wittenberg, etc. To Heinrich Bullinger in Wittenberg.</p>
