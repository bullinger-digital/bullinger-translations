      <p>Greetings. As you requested in your letters, most illustrious man, I will briefly inform you of what I know about English affairs. The marriage between Philipp (Philip), King of Spain, and the Queen of England has now been initiated. The conditions are said to be as follows: the king will enter England accompanied by very few Spaniards; no Spaniard will have any administration of the ports nor any castles or fortified places in the kingdom; the Belgian principality is joined to England in such a way that a son to be born from this marriage will be the future King of England and Prince of Lower Germany; furthermore, if it should happen that Philip's first son, who is currently being raised in Spain, were to die, the King of England will also be the King of Spain; England will be governed by its own laws as before and through its own (as they call them) parliaments, and Spaniards will not be admitted among the royal advisors; the queen will not be compelled under any pretext to leave the kingdom and will receive thirty thousand ducats annually from Spain, nor will the English be bound to undertake any war for King Philip's sake. All these things have been promised by the Emperor, from which, as you can easily understand how dear this alliance was to them, you can also conjecture with what faith he will keep his promises.</p>
      <p>Now a fleet is being sent from England to bring Philip to the queen in the month of April; the envoys who are going together are the Bishop of London, the great treasurer, and Lord Obęus. There is a rumor spreading about the Duke of Suffolk that he has died; however, the matter is not certain, and I do not easily believe it.</p>
      <p>As for matters pertaining to religion, they are entirely calamitous, and as far as I can see, no remedy presents itself; indeed, it is to be feared that as this Spanish alliance proceeds, everything will become worse day by day. I do not know how you can send letters there; I am also stuck in the same mire, and only one way (as I think) remains, to send them to Antwerp; for if you have friends there, they will be able to direct them without much trouble to wherever you wish. Otherwise, it is very difficult to know where our good friends are residing in England, since they are forced either to hide or to wander, unless they wish to consent to impiety, and those who are wealthier fear for their fortunes and therefore do not willingly undertake the care of our letters, lest they be suspected.</p>
      <p>As for your congratulating me on recovering my former position here, which matter was only completed today, you indeed do so with a friendly and benevolent spirit as always; may the Lord grant that I may someday reap the desired fruit of my labor. But since you know that he who plants and he who waters are nothing, it remains for you to help me with your prayers, so that God, who gives the increase, may deign to open the door.</p>
      <p>I have spoken with your son for a little while about his studies, and if things are as he says, he seems to be spending his time not badly; but when I have discovered more certainly, I will not let you remain ignorant. In the meantime, I wish you to be of good hope; for you will become more certain of his successes through me day by day, as convenience and opportunity for writing will be given. The young man who will deliver this to you is yours and has been in England for several years, and since he is upright in morals and piety and I have observed his diligence in studies, I commend him to you; for if you assist him, I do not think such support, whatever it may be, will be misplaced. Farewell and love me as you do. Lord Zanchus greets you. Bid all the fellow ministers in my name to be well. Strasbourg, January 22, 1554.</p>
      <p>Yours most devoted, Peter Martyr.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the Church of Zürich.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
