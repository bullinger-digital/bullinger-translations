      <p>My willing service with the offering of all honors and goods beforehand. Honorable dear sir, yesterday my messenger, whom I sent to Augsburg to the Emperor on the orders of my lords, the Confederates, returned home; he stayed quietly in Augsburg for 14 days before he was noticed. The reason for sending him out was because of the provisions that are being denied to our people beyond the mountains from Milan, about which the Emperor gives an evasive answer, with the intention that he wants to inquire with his governor in Milan and properly arrange (if it can be done) to take action. Further, the messenger reports to me how the Emperor is sending a large force without interruption to Magdeburg, and he is also preparing a great power against Hungary; for the Turk is said to be planning to advance with all his might there towards Austria. He says the Emperor is quite pale; yet he now walks around daily in his court, where he resides, so that anyone who wants can see him. In Reutlingen, there are 500 Gulden soldiers, many Spanish troops come daily from Italy to Augsburg, which is quite believable; for here in Baden, they have been passing through without interruption for several days now, and still, though many are inconsiderate people. These are the news I have from my messenger.</p>
      <p>I ask you to greet Master Hans Friesen, my dear brother, and wish you both and your household a happy new year. With this, I commend you to God. Dated Baden, January 7, in the year 1551. Your always willing Gilg Tschudi of Glarus, bailiff in Baden.</p>
      <p>To the worthy, well-regarded, highly learned Master Heinrich Bullinger, pastor in Zurich, my kind, dear sir.</p>
