      <p> Greetings. I received your letter written on the first day of this month... I would wish, if leisure and health permitted; but I hope to depart for Zürich shortly. For the king writes to the most honorable council, as I thought it should be done; I will carry the letters myself. In the meantime, I am writing again to the consul, to hold back, as long as it seems fair and right to him, to ask the people of Lucerne through letters to wait until the next Baden diet. For although everything is in the best state and the king wishes to satisfy them, as all sensible people will judge, they wrote to me that unless the king gives a response and promises to give ten percent and pay the interest of two years this month and in June the third year with one thousand two hundred crowns for expenses, which they never declared, they will send their people with judges to Payerne on the 16th of this month. If this happens, the young king's mind may perhaps be alienated from what he intended to do, and this matter will be ridiculous to everyone. For the judges in Payerne will be able to decide nothing, because first the contradiction of the sentences, which recently delayed them, must be resolved and an agreement on the fifth arbitrator must be reached; but I want to abide by the decision of all the envoys. I ask you to commend this business to the consul, if the occasion presents itself. </p>
      <p> Happy is he who has no business with such morose and obstinate people, who know neither fairness nor goodness and are devoid of common sense and all humanity. I heard that the princes of Nuremberg have once again confirmed the Augsburg Confession. </p>
      <p> I had written to Master Ciconius to give Rambouillet ten crowns in the meantime, if he needed them; I will soon bring thirty, which are in Geneva, even if I have not yet received them. </p>
      <p> Greet the lords and all friends and love us. </p>
      <p> May the Lord keep you. </p>
      <p> Solothurn, March 3rd. </p>
      <p> I received that the five Pagic agreed that the Saracens captured in Lenzburg burden them, as they were solicited by them against the people of Glarus. They will meet again to inspect what was done concerning the people of Glarus at the last diet; they will not rest until they bring harm upon themselves. Yours sincerely, Coignet. </p>
      <p> To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, proclaimer of the word of God. Zürich. </p>
