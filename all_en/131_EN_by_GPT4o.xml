      <p>Nikolaus Artopoeus to his dear Heinrich Bullinger, greetings and best wishes.</p>
      <p>The situation regarding Mr. Benedikt, most learned man, will be explained to you in person. To us, it does not seem very complicated, if only it can be settled with Lord Consul Negelin. He, above all others (and not without reason, as far as I can understand), is greatly displeased by the inconsistency or, if you prefer, imprudence of the one who did not learn from previous mistakes when he published that pamphlet by Doctor Wissemburg on the authority of synods, relying on I don't know what. Therefore, Mr. Jodocus and I earnestly ask you not to abandon the poor man and, if it seems appropriate to you and can be done without inconvenience to yourself, to reconcile him with the Lord Consul through a letter. However, we do not want you to do this if the matter is not entirely to your liking.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most upright man, and act according to your humanity, as you have been accustomed to do until now. Today, Sulcerus left here without saying goodbye, as it is said, to Batto, who is still said to be unaware of where he will go. Farewell, and on our behalf, please give our warmest regards to Mr. Haller and all your colleagues.</p>
      <p>Bern, May 24.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, a man renowned for his learning and piety.</p>
