    <p xml:id="regest1">Finally sends the preface [No. 1774] to the John [Commentary]; [Christoph] Froschauer reports [from the fair] in Frankfurt that he has sold numerous copies of both the John and the Matthew commentaries; Blarer's letter [No. 1787] was just delivered to him by Michael [Adam], whom he also appreciates. Fears the downfall [of Duke Wilhelm] of Jülich due to a letter from the Basel council: Emperor [Charles V] has moved to Venlo after taking Düren and other cities in Jülich, as well as Roermond in Gelderland; the Duke submitted to the Emperor through the mediation of Duke Heinrich of Brunswick and [Nicolas de Perrenot, Lord of] Granvelle; Christoph von Landenberg and [Gian Giacomo de' Medici, Castellan of] Musso are also in the imperial entourage. The Frenchman [Francis I] has taken Luxembourg and is now besieging Thionville; Gran fell to the Turks through treachery. In all this distress, God stands by those who believe in Him. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Grace and innocence of life from the Lord.</p>
      <p>For a long time now, my most learned and esteemed Ambrosius, I have prepared the preface to John, but lacked a suitable messenger; now having found one, I am sending it. Froschauer writes from Frankfurt that he has sold many copies, not only of John but also of Matthew. I have just received your letter from our Michael, whom I have always loved and supported to the best of my ability, and I will continue to do so. I have not yet spoken with him. Nevertheless, I give great thanks for your letters and diligence.</p>
      <p>I greatly fear that the matter of Jülich has been settled; for the day before, the Basel council sent us this: "Düren was taken by the Emperor with a violent storm that lasted from morning until evening on August 24. He then moved on August 27, having captured several cities and castles in Jülich; from there he moved to Roermond in Gelderland, which also surrendered. Further, he moved to Venlo; there the Duke came to the Emperor's camp on September 6 around 3 in the afternoon, brought by Duke Heinrich of Brunswick (the mediator). He stayed overnight in Granvelle's tent; the next morning, he came before the Emperor dressed in black with his advisors and nobility, about 80 people, fell on his knees, and begged for mercy, etc. The Emperor is said to have received him in a princely and gracious manner, etc. On the 8th day, Venlo is said to have surrendered. Christoph von Landenberg is well at the court with the Emperor, the one from Musso and Brunswick. On the same day, peace was proclaimed in the camp, and all preparations are being made against the French. The Frenchman took Luxembourg on Wednesday, September 12, and from there moved to besiege Thionville, intending to starve it out, etc. The Emperor is said to want to relieve it, etc. Strigonium was surrendered by Italian soldiers, the Pope's sons, to the Turkish Emperor through treachery." Thus writes the Basel council to ours.</p>
      <p>Everywhere, bad news, treachery, defections, and disasters are reported. But God lives, and those who believe in Him will not be put to shame. I could not write more now. The people seem to need to be exhorted to repentance and prayer. May the Lord Jesus keep us.</p>
      <p>Zurich, September 25.</p>
      <p>Greet all your people diligently.</p>
      <p>H. Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To D. Ambrosius Blarer, my dear and esteemed friend and brother.</p>
