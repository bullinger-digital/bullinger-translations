    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger has received two letters from Erb [hbbw XX, No. 3098; 18031] and admittedly has not written himself for a long time. The last time he sent a letter [hbbw XX, No. 3048, from October 21] for Erb [for transmission] to Count Georg of Württemberg-Mömpelgard was probably in November of last year.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">In December, he received Erb's first letter [hbbw XX, No. 3098] containing his previously written reflections [on the Lord's Supper], for which he is grateful. He has no objections to them but agrees with them. The apostles support their teaching, or rather: both of them agree in their teaching with that of the apostles. May they always remain in this stance!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">The silence of the people of Zurich, lamented by Erb in his last letter [18031], has significant reasons. However, this does not make Erb any less dear to them! They remember the people of Reichenweier in their prayers. They also know that they do not need to encourage the people of Reichenweier, as the Holy Spirit provides them with comfort. It is also known to them that the people of Reichenweier adhere to God's word and provide comfort to others.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">The people of Zurich regret the decay of the church and church discipline in the dominion of Reichenweier. However, Erb and his colleagues should do their utmost in proclaiming the word of God, endure as long as possible, and seek God's assistance, but without challenging it! If, however, the Holy Spirit and circumstances lead them to justified flight, they should not shy away from fleeing, just as Christ, Peter, and Paul did, to remain available for more suitable tasks for the church.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">If the church of Zurich [still] exists, it will gladly receive the preachers from Reichenweier and support them as best as possible. Even if the people of Zurich themselves perish or are expelled, God will not abandon them! They want to place all their trust in Him. Now the [end] time has come, in which it is believed to be a special service to God to kill [the Evangelicals]. But the Lord will surely not abandon [the believers]!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Emperor Charles V is allegedly recruiting mercenaries. With these, he will first attack the Confederates, then the Hanseatic cities, and afterwards Pope [Paul III] and [King Henry II] of France. Only God, to whom the people of Zurich entrust themselves, knows what will happen.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Greetings, especially to the city clerk [Oswald Fürstenlob] and [the pastor] Nikolaus König.</p>

      <p>S.D. I received the letters from you, my dearest Erb, with your kindness, and I must confess that I have neglected the duty of writing for a long time. The last time, if I remember correctly, I wrote in November of the past year and sent a letter to your prince.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>In December, I received your first letter along with your previously written meditations. For these, I thank you. I have no criticism in this matter: We agree! My writings align with yours. And I know that we agree with the apostles, or rather, they agree with us. Let us always persevere in their doctrine, so that we may also be united in their body and fellowship.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>Your later letters also complain about our silence. But excuse us, my brother! Extremely complicated matters prevent us from doing what we wish. Nevertheless, we love you. You are commended to us in our prayers. We know you do not need consolation. You have the Comforter, the Holy Spirit. You hold the word of God in your hearts. You console others.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>However, we are grieved that both your church and church discipline have fallen into such decay. Do what you can to perfect the preaching of the word of God. Endure as long as you can! Call upon the Lord's help! Meanwhile, do not test the Lord. If the Spirit of God and circumstances invite you to a justified flight, do not be ashamed to preserve yourselves for better things and the church, as Christ, Peter, and Paul did.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>If we live and are safe, all our resources are open to you. We will gladly welcome you and assist you to the best of our ability. If we ourselves have fallen or have been driven from our seats, we will not be neglected by our Lord. Let us place all our trust in Him. Now is the time we have long heard about. The time will come when those who kill you will think they are offering a service to God. Surely God will not neglect us!</p>

    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>It is said that Emperor Charles V is preparing and enlisting soldiers, whom he will first lead against the Swiss, then against the maritime cities, and then against the Pope and the French, etc. What will happen, God knows, to whom we commend our affairs.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell with all your people, especially the scribe and the pastor. Zurich, February 17, 1548.</p>
      <p>Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Matthias Erb, minister of the church in Richenweier, his dearest brother in the Lord. Reichenweier.</p>
