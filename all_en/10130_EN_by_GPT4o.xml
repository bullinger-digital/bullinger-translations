      <p>Greetings. I have not yet received the letters entrusted to a certain WÃ¤ber to be delivered to me, dearest Heinrich. Meanwhile, as we have just barely finished the chapters throughout the Bernese countryside, a new tragedy with the Anabaptists overwhelms us. A day for disputation has been proclaimed by a common decree of the senate for the last day of this month in Zofingen, because many dread our city. A safe conduct has also been granted, so that they can call upon foreigners, from wherever they may be, who support their sect and act as leaders, so that they may come and go freely, under the condition that the articles of the Anabaptists be proposed solely from the word of God with modesty, without insults and contention from either side. We are not calling anyone from our side, neither you nor Capito nor others, not because we think we alone are most equipped to oppose them, but so that the slippery beasts we have here and there in the countryside cannot later mock us for being unable to do anything against them and continue to seduce our people. Andreas Rappestein of Lucerne has worked very hard to get them to agree to a reasoned faith and to give and receive from us, which he has not been able to obtain from them, even though he is very familiar with them. Meanwhile, they do not cease to secretly sow their errors. Therefore, it seemed good to the brothers here and there throughout the countryside, whose churches they disturb and impose on the simplicity of many with hypocrisy, to report to the senate. By its counsel, this conflict was proclaimed. Twenty of our more learned pastors will be present, as well as appointed assessors from the towns and dominions of Aargau, and delegates from our city, of whom four will be chosen as presidents to restrain any immodesty, should it occur. I wanted to inform you of this so that you know by what means and methods this decree was made. How I wish you could be present of your own accord, not only as a listener but also as a consultant! I do not doubt that, wherever they choose to appear, there will be a very large audience and a need for the counsel of many. I secretly demand from you, when you have recovered, your opinion. You know how great my spirit is towards you. Our senate will not call anyone. Meanwhile, I hear that their main article will be that they will not accept the Old Testament and will cunningly compel us to listen to the New Testament alone. I therefore beseech you, if you have anything on this, to share it.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, I received the booklet against Fabri's lies at Megander's house, but I have not seen the one you recommended in your letters. I continually thank you, not only because you gift me with your work, but also because you strive to benefit the entire republic with your studies, piety, and learning. I praise your modesty, and so do all the readers. Continue prosperously, proceed and reign, or rather let Christ reign through you, who has chosen you as His instrument.</p>
      <p>It would be beneficial for Bertram's booklet to be translated into the German language; for it will have more readers. Finally, whatever you deem advisable in the Anabaptist matter, advise us in time, and you will greatly gratify us. I do not doubt that much has occurred since the publication of your dialogues. If only you could share it with me at leisure. Otherwise, there is no news with us.</p>
      <p>Farewell, my dearest heart.</p>
      <p>June 3, Bern, in the year 32.</p>
      <p>Yours entirely, Haller.</p>
      <p>On the 4th of June, I received your letters along with the mandate of the Zurichers, and at the same hour of that day, Fabian, already prepared for the journey, arrived. To whom I entrusted these, sympathizing with your infirmity as with my own. May the Lord keep you safe for all His churches. We will persistently press Him with prayers. Many rumors are circulating here about a priest drowned by your people, about 500 wanting to overthrow Zug. I can hardly wait to know the truth.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, minister of the Zurich church, his dearest brother.</p>
