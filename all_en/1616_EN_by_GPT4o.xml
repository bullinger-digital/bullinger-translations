      <p>Georg, Count of Württemberg and Mömpelgard (Montbéliard) etc.</p>
      <p>Our greetings to you first, dear friend. We have received your letter today, stating that you could not accept the wine we sent you (according to the regulations and customs of the city of Zurich), and we understand your apology. However, since we intended to show you our gracious goodwill this time with the wine without expecting anything in return, unaware of the city's regulations, and since it is held as such, we will leave it at that, considering how things are in these times, this regulation is not regarded in vain. We also hereby send back to you the regulations sent to us with [gracious] thanks for the two French booklets sent to us, etc. With our lackey, we wanted to send you the enclosed letters; however, due to other business that occupied us at the time, it was forgotten, which is why the mentioned news is now outdated compared to those we are sending you now. We did not want to withhold them from you [graciously]; for we are inclined to your [grace]. Dated Schaffhausen, the 12th of April, in the year etc. 52.</p>
      <p>G[eorg] C[ount] o[f] Württemberg etc.</p>
      <p>To our dear friend Heinrich Bullinger, preacher in Zurich.</p>
