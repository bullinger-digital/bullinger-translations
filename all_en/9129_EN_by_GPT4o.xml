      <p>Greetings. Although I am not in very good health, I cannot let our Ricaud leave without my letter to you. He was one of the principal pastors of the church in Lyon and, by the miraculous grace of God, escaped the massacre that took place there. He was received by our people in Lausanne; in the meantime, he is sent by certain nobles, who are exiled in Geneva and in our regions, to our evangelical republics in Switzerland to request that they intercede with the king so that they may enjoy their properties in the kingdom despite their absence. This plan of theirs, as untimely and futile, could not please or be approved by us, and as much as it was in our power, we dissuaded him from this plan and especially thought it was not his place to do this, but, confirmed by the counsel of others unknown to me, and having also received letters from the senate to the envoys who are in Baden, he proceeds from there to you as well. He will therefore explain everything in person. So that we would not fail him, we wanted to send you the letters he brought us from Geneva in this regard, so that you may see in whose name and by what authority he has undertaken this mission; we ask that they be returned to us through him.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I assume you have received Steiger's wine; however, an error seems to have occurred; for the honorable consul only gave half the transport cost to the driver, and he wanted the remaining part to be taken care of by me, enclosed in a letter. However, the messenger Rodolphus Mag from Zürich, to whom I handed those letters, left here later than we expected; thus, we fear that the driver may have preceded the messenger.</p>
      <p>Therefore, please inform us how these matters have reached you.</p>
      <p>He has nothing new now. We are waiting to see what will be brought from the assemblies. He carries with him a well-described history of French affairs. He will also inform you about the current state of affairs.</p>
      <p>Farewell. All of ours greet you.</p>
      <p>Bern, December 11, 1572, at nightfall.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, always yours.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the Zürich church, my honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
