      <p>I received your most welcome letters, most reverend lord, in which, beyond manifesting your goodwill towards me, you still remember your friends. As for the news that your lordship received from Germany, it has been confirmed to me, so that they have certainty except in the part concerning the brother of the new Turkish emperor, who long ago, while his father Suleiman was alive, defected to the king of Persia, and he was called Bayezid, who indeed, while his father was alive, was beheaded by the said king of Persia, believing he was doing a pleasing deed for his father. It is true that Selim, now the emperor, has a son who is already 24 years old, named Murad.</p>
      <p>But of other matters, there is no mention. It is true that I heard something about a four-year truce being proclaimed between the Turk and the emperor, which, if it has certainty, would give leisure to the enemies of Christ to afflict his church. But as I hear from the Venetians, envoys have been sent to renew the treaty and truce with the new Turkish emperor, which is a clear sign that they fear his forces, which they know are being prepared in great numbers for the coming summer, and they are fortifying the province of Friuli, which we commonly call Fre Just. This is from the Venetians.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, I received certain news that around three thousand Spaniards have joined in Genoa, who are immediately stationed in garrisons near the Piedmontese, and a little before, around two thousand had landed among the Milanese. I heard that most certainly, if the king of Spain comes to these parts, which we do not yet have certainty of due to the great variety of opinions, he intends to introduce that rigor of the inquisition in Milan and the same in the kingdom of Naples, and when one of his familiars pleaded and prayed that he would mitigate it, he replied that he would rather suffer the loss of that kingdom and duchy than abandon a well-begun endeavor. May the Lord our God act in the rest and reward each according to his divine will. In our Rhaetia, all things are going quite well, and recently, when I proposed on behalf of the troops that my king requests from them and for the intercession to preserve the league between us, which I feared lest any of them should involve themselves in the service of the king of Spain (for their variety is sometimes great), I obtained that they would promulgate an edict that none of the subjects should pass to another service except that of my most Christian king according to the agreements under penalty of death and confiscation of goods. We will see about the rest according to the occurrence of events.</p>
      <p>Farewell well, lord, together with your family, and I commend myself to you in our French manner. I recommend you to Lord Walter and the other friends, citizens of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Written in the castle of Haldenstein, February 2, 1567.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted and obedient friend, Pierre de Grantrye.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and learned man, Lord Bullinger, first minister of the holy church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>In Zurich.</p>
