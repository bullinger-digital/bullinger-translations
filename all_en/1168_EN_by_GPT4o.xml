      <p>Greetings. I am sending you here, most esteemed lord and godfather, the news that we have, especially the acts of the assembly, which we received from Augsburg. After reading them, please return them to me, I pray. I received from our Gervasius the news of the victory of the people of Magdeburg and the defeat of Maurice, which you communicated to him; these agreed with what Blaurer also wrote to me about these matters. A certain citizen of ours, coming from Nuremberg these days, says that it is commonly rumored there that the Duke of Mecklenburg died in Magdeburg from a wound and that Eric of Brunswick was captured by a certain nobleman and beheaded, and that Maurice had his other cheek shattered by a cannon shot. Our consul from Wattenwyl said in the senate that there is not much to fear from the Emperor henceforth; for he is already approaching the underworld, as he has heard, I believe, from his son, who is at the Emperor's court. Much is being said about the Turkish preparations; but I do not know how certain it is. It is certain that those imperial cannons were transported from Brabant to Burgundy several months ago and are now being brought back to those lower parts, from which it is hoped that the Emperor will have something to occupy him with others, so that we may enjoy tranquility. Meanwhile, let us pray diligently to the Lord, the father and author of all peace, that he may deign to grant it to us and to others. The plague has not yet completely ceased among us; it has already taken a third student from our college, from which it has been made free for the others to return to their homes for a few days. Hence, lectures are now vacant. I wish to know from you what is happening with you. Farewell. May your entire family be safe, and may the brothers also be safe. All of ours send many greetings to you and yours. Bern, February 2, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Johannes Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man and most faithful minister of Christ and the church, Heinrich Bullinger, his venerable lord and godfather, the chief pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich.</p>
