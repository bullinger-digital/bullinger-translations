      <p>Greetings. I do not know what our people have again regarding the disturbance of the confederates against the people of Glarus; however, they are very restless and doubtful about these rumors, since you write nothing. Therefore, they write through this to yours, so that they may be vigilant and communicate with them without delay, if they have anything. It is reported among the papists of Glarus that someone was stabbed by a certain evangelical, and hence the Cantons are stirred; however, we do not know for certain. Prudent men advise me to write to you, so that you may be an authority for yours to write to us more frequently; for since you are closer, it is also more your duty to be vigilant in this matter.</p>
      <p>From France, we have nothing else yet than what I recently wrote, except that Mr. Viret has set out and been led to Nîmes, so that he may preach there; that city is in Narbonne, France, not far from Montpellier. In Lyon, they say that the president of the city and region of Lyon, who was the greatest enemy of the gospel, has been removed from office and replaced by a prudent and upright man, so that there is hope that the success of the word will now also be greater there.</p>
      <p>I have nothing else to write now, and I wrote these things very hastily, as I have just been informed by our Hagius about the departure of this one and all these matters. He greets you; may all of yours be safe.</p>
      <p>Greet my brother, to whom I do not have time to write now. In Bern, October 10th, on which I am not forgetful of the fateful day, on which I last saw my dearest father 30 years ago. May the Lord someday avenge his blood and that of others who suffered then.</p>
      <p>Johannes Haller, entirely yours.</p>
      <p>Let us also know what is happening among the Rhaetians.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his honorable lord and dearest compatriot.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
