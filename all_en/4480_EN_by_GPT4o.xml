      <p>Greetings. Regarding the French disturbances, I understand nothing except that there is hope that King of Navarre will come to Paris and to the royal court on the 20th of this month, and with his and his brother's arrival, everything will be more peaceful. The Pope openly wishes for a council, provided it continues in Trent or is held in another city in Italy or in Piedmont. He suspects all the cities of Germany.</p>
      <p>This local contention will be prolonged into another time or rather into another age; at some point, Christ and the elect will bear witness to the gospel. If you have learned anything about the Stuttgart assembly or about the state of affairs in Germany and Rhaetia, I beg you again and again to inform me, and do not fear to burden the postman, my host, whom you know receives a great stipend to safely send letters to me as far as Baden, and whom I have preserved in that role so that I might more frequently enjoy your letters. I expect a generous and royal response from the most honorable magistrate regarding the king's honorable request, and I have already received what I wished for from the people of Bern. May the Lord keep you safe.</p>
      <p>Greet our mutual friends and love us, as you do. Solothurn, 3rd of October.</p>
      <p>Yours sincerely, Coignet.</p>
      <p>To Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in ZÃ¼rich.</p>
