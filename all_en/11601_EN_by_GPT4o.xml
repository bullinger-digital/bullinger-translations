      <p>Greetings. I received all your writings from Adam and, while I was engaged in other matters, I gave them to Markus to read. He returned them the next morning, just as the courier was preparing to leave. Indeed, I have not yet read a single letter. I thought there would be no harm in keeping them a little longer, until I could read them at leisure. I have written about all other matters to Gwalther through the same Adam.</p>
      <p>Now I must go to church. Farewell in Christ with your family and Theodor. Hastily, Basel, August 21, 1541.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord.</p>
