      <p>Greetings. I had entirely hoped that what I had written to the most distinguished man, the legate, would be communicated to you, dearest brother, and indeed those were brief and I do not have more extensive ones now. The sum of all: the gospel of Christ is proceeding successfully in England and no less successfully in Scotland; for the gospel must be preached to the ends of the earth before the judgment. In Spain, too, it is certain that there are great disturbances, for the sake of quelling which King Philip has set out there by sea, not without great danger and loss, as he is said to have been cast ashore on a certain island of England, from where he soon set sail for Spain.</p>
      <p>In France, the persecution against the faithful rages so fiercely as scarcely ever before. So wrote to me these days Mr. Calvin; the blame is ascribed to the Guise family, otherwise hated by France and especially the nobility. However, through such afflictions, churches are accustomed to grow.</p>
      <p>Let us pray to the Lord, that He may be present with His church and His good servants. In Germany, there are many contentions, especially in Saxony.</p>
      <p>Philip is sought by many; he himself seems to be a sacramentarian. The Prince of Hesse maintains the old ways and loves us.</p>
      <p>The recently elected or created Elector Palatine is much better than the one who passed away; we hope (as much as one can hope from a man) not insignificant things from him. The Duke of Württemberg is among others vehemently against us; for he is instigated by Brenz. But the Lord will also put an end to these; for everywhere there are good men who understand and support the truth.</p>
      <p>We hear nothing from Poland now; however, it is said that the kingdom's assembly is to be held there soon, and to be as brief as possible, I send here some writings for you to read, but with the condition that you return them enclosed to your people, especially the letters of Jaski, to which a response will be due in these days. Mr. Horn, Mr. Jewel, who lived with the Martyr, Mr. Sampson, Mr. Sandys, Mr. Pilkington, the Englishmen who lived here in Zurich and devoted themselves to letters, are all said to have been made bishops in England: Jewel himself writes that he is designated for Salisbury, etc.</p>
      <p>I pray you consider these things well.</p>
      <p>Farewell.</p>
      <p>Most hastily.</p>
      <p>Zurich, 13th October 1559.</p>
      <p>All of mine greet you.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>About the Bernese and the Savoyards another time; a friendly day will be at Neuchâtel on 1st November. To the most excellent man Mr. Johannes Fabricius, minister of the church of Chur, my dearest brother and compatriot. To Chur, to Mr. Hans Schmid, pastor at St. Martin.</p>
