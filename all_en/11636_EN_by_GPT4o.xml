      <p>On the 24th of December, letters arrived from Antwerp stating that the Emperor [Charles V] had arrived safely and successfully in Cartagena, Spain, on December 4th. His Majesty conducted himself bravely and chivalrously before Algiers. When the Italians fled, His Majesty, along with the German soldiers, turned them back and personally charged among them, killing three Italian soldiers and striking a great Italian captain across the face up to the middle of his head, thus driving the Turks and Moors back into the city of Algiers. However, it rained heavily day and night, and there was no provision or large artillery present; otherwise, Algiers would have been conquered without any means. His Majesty is preparing again vigorously; the damage with the ruined ships and galleys, and what was in them, is not small. From Cartagena, His Majesty travels to Valladolid and then to Toledo to his children; there he has convened a great diet, summoning all his kingdoms to him; it is expected that His Majesty will give much and large sums of money. His Majesty is making great provisions and intends to return with force in the spring. He has appointed Andrea Doria to Genoa; he is also to prepare again, and His Majesty has shown him great favor and granted him an annual income of 4000 ducats more than before.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there are reports from Prague that the diet in Bohemia has ended very well, so that everyone has agreed to give the king, from 100 florins, one, and the common man from 30 to 40 florins. It is generally believed that the Austrian lands will contribute more, so it is hoped that there will be much money available.</p>
      <p>The King of England has had his current wife executed and bled to death until she died; she was accused of having had an affair. The king has recently captured 32 great lords and ladies, had two great lords executed, so that their genitals were cut off and then burned with fire; also, the queen's maiden along with 3 other lords were beheaded, among them the Duke of Norfolk, his mother, and brother.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, Barbarossa with 130 sails is at sea, strengthening the Turks greatly, and the Turks are in great preparation by sea and land. Within three weeks, they have raided Székesfehérvár, plundered several villages, and taken many people away; there is a poor truce for the spring; all misfortune is expected. The Turkish embassy has rejoiced in Venice with the authorities over the victory their lord had before Buda, and they have requested that they want to help the Turks and the King of France.</p>
      <p>In Paris, there are many German captains; I have a letter from December 14th, the king would like to go to Milan, but does not dare to do so, as the Emperor has arrived safely in Spain. France is in a marriage alliance with England, giving the Duke of Orléans to the eldest daughter in England, all against the Emperor; it is not known whether the marriage will take place or not.</p>
      <p>The Roman king is sending much provision from Vienna to Gran, intending to recapture Buda in the coming summer. These tumultuous news from some letters were communicated to me after the sealing of another letter, which I did not want you to be unaware of.</p>
