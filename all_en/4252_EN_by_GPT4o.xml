      <p>S. D. What you diligently and earnestly, venerable lord and esteemed compater, have sought to obtain from me with many prayers, namely, that I should ensure, with all the faith I can muster, that the bundle sent to me is delivered to the Prince of Württemberg, I have procured as faithfully as I could. For yesterday, when I understood that you especially desired this, I myself set out to the castle of Duelli and delivered it in your name to the captain of that garrison, who received it in good faith, promising to ensure it would be delivered into the prince's own hands. Therefore, there is no reason for you to doubt; the prince himself will certainly receive it without delay.</p>
      <p>There was no need for you to plead with so many words, when you could have commanded by your right; for even if I had not previously been bound to your kindness due to the immense benefits bestowed upon me, it was so pleasing to me to see your letters that I would have done anything for that reason alone; for they were most welcome to me, knowing that you are occupied and distracted by many and various labors and affairs, so that you have little or no time to spend on writing letters to brothers and friends. Yet, amidst the storms of business, oblivion of me has not yet crept in, who am removed to the farthest limits of Switzerland, to the not-so-pleasant Swabians. I was not a little refreshed, having not only received your letters but also a book as a gift from you, which, due to its subject matter and illustrious treatment, dignity, and constancy, cannot but be pleasing, and because it was sent to me as a gift from you, it is by far the most pleasing. And indeed, because I had received no letters from you for a longer period, I could not bear it with a more unjust mind for certain reasons; yet what was lacking there, this testimony of your love for me can easily make up for. I therefore have great thanks to return to your kindness, without a doubt, if I could in any way or if any opportunity should present itself. My affairs are as they are.</p>
      <p>I have wholly committed myself to the most merciful and wise Lord and to His always best will, in whose providence alone my hope and solace are placed. I now ask you as much as possible to continue to have me recommended; perhaps sometime it will be granted that I may speak more with you in person.</p>
      <p>All of mine send greetings to you and yours.</p>
      <p>Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>A courier presented himself unexpectedly here; therefore, I had to write hastily; he was just about to leave. Farewell again.</p>
      <p>I wish health to Mr. Gwalter, Lavater, Zwingli, and the other venerable brothers and colleagues.</p>
      <p>Stein am Rhein, April 1, 1560. Your most devoted Christian Hochholtzer.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful Antistes of the Zürich church, his most esteemed lord and compater.</p>
