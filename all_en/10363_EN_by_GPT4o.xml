    <p xml:id="regest1">Myconius does not want to keep two matters to himself any longer: 1. As long as the people of Zurich do not reintroduce the Secret Council, no one can do anything for them. This instrument is urgently needed, Bullinger should discuss it with Hans Rudolf Lavater. - 2. King Francis I of France is not hostile to the Gospel, Myconius heard from an evangelical nobleman, but the King must conceal it from the Catholic church leaders of his country. This goodwill is shown by the delay in the execution of four evangelicals in Paris, as desired by Noël Béda, and the booklets sent by the King to the Swiss Diet, which are now freely read in France; this is also reported by the assistant of the bookseller Konrad Resch, who arrived from Paris. Myconius asks for Bullinger's opinion. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. There are two matters that I could no longer keep to myself, no matter how much leisure is lacking.</p>
      <p>The first, which I recently wrote about myself, now I write from our head about the secret council, as I may call it. I hear clearly that as long as you lack this, nothing good can be done for you by anyone. If you had it, there are countless things that could be done back and forth that would be of great benefit. Therefore, if a way could be found to restore it, I see how much it would provide for our affairs. I have learned that nothing is more adverse to evils. I heard, while I was staying there, someone saying: "Let our leaders with that council go to hell. A good man is not safe in his own house." Consider what he said here. These matters should be discussed with Lavater, with whom they were also previously discussed, if something could be found that would benefit your republic.</p>
      <p>The second is about the King of the French. The day before I wrote this, I spoke with a man of noble birth and outstanding evangelical profession. Among other things, we mentioned the French King. Then he said almost in this manner: "Not everyone knows what the King is doing. It is certain to me that he does not wish ill to the Gospel, and that he conceals this only because he cannot do otherwise due to the bishops of his kingdom. But let him obtain the parts of Italy he desires. You will see what friendship will remain with the Pope and the papists. What I say, he has already abundantly proven in the case of the four whom they held captive in Paris and still hold because of the Gospel. For when Béda wanted to hand them over to the fire, he has saved them until now. Then he forced Béda to meet with them privately and show his ignorance, which resulted in great disgrace for him. For he applied his nonsense very poorly to the scriptures of God."</p>
      <p>Then also the booklets, which the King sent to the Swiss Diet long ago, are freely available and read in France, as the servant of Konrad Resch, the bookseller, who came from Paris, said the day before yesterday. Judge, my most beloved Bullinger, what this means, whether faith should be placed in this matter or not. Some think that for this reason Hesse and some cities, which have so far supported the Gospel, are in agreement with the King. I did not want you to be unaware of this.</p>
      <p>Farewell and greet all the brothers in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, the day before the calends of March in the year 34.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Lord Heinrich Bullinger, the primary among the Zurichers, his esteemed brother.</p>
