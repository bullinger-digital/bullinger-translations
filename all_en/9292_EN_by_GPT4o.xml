      <p>Venerable, highly and well-learned sir, my willing service be with you always, etc. Before anything else, dear sir, on the 14th of this month with Heinrich Zily, I sent you the latest, in which is the letter from the lord of Beza. Before that, this came to me from Augsburg, in which you will learn what is new. I have also received similar news from Venice and Antwerp from Amsterdam. The Venetians have made a good deal with the Turks, which is bad for Christendom; it must go on like this, the arrogance of the Antichrist, the Spaniards, and the Italians must be laid down, to unite us Germans. From Lyon, I have since received nothing useful, except that the 6000 Confederates are lying before St. Serra. Something is supposed to happen with the king and Manzeron with the dogs on the hunt. We hope to have news this week about the new king in Poland, where it is constantly assumed that it will be the emperor's son. If it has happened, the posts would already be here. The election is essentially set. I suppose you will have it beforehand, also the cardinal's letter, a reminder about it. I hope to God that the Christian princes will not let the murder go unpunished and will also help the prince. Those in Haarlem are all knightly. I am preparing for my journey every day, intending to ride to my gracious lord to request a good prescription, to put it in Latin. May God the Lord grant grace that it comes to ours. Amen. The treasurer has provided me with the 100 crowns; otherwise, I have received nothing, only promises. With that, you and yours are entrusted to the dear God in grace. May He preserve you. Amen.</p>
      <p>Your willing servant always, Hans Liner.</p>
      <p>To the venerable and well-learned sir Heinrich Bullinger the elder, faithful servant of the church, my dear, beloved lord in Zurich.</p>
