      <p>Greetings. I have wanted to write to you three times since I arrived here, most holy man and most esteemed brother in the Lord, but I was never able to finish the letters before those who were to carry them had already left. Now, however, I did not want to let the messenger who presented himself to me leave without my letters to you. He is a pious man and very devoted to you, as you have many such here.</p>
      <p>There are many things I should write to you about, but it is neither safe nor does time allow me to write everything. However, I ask this of all of you there, that what I write to you should be considered as written to all of you who are colleagues in the same ministry: for truly I could not write to each one individually.</p>
      <p>First, I give thanks to our Lord God that He advances and illuminates the kingdom of His Son through your ministry there, and I sincerely congratulate your churches on the agreement in doctrine introduced between you and Herr Calvin on the matter of the sacraments, and I hope that more will subscribe to it daily. Here we follow the same doctrine, even if we sometimes express it in different words, and shortly, if the Lord wills, we will all unanimously publish our confession. Indeed, we also have the best expectations regarding some Saxon churches in this matter through God's grace.</p>
      <p>Here, by the grace of God and our king, we have established a German and a French church, and we have public ministry of the word in two places in the German and French languages. Now we are discussing the pure use of the sacraments and discipline, as far as it can be done, which we hope to have shortly, by God's grace. Furthermore, we gather the church in such a way that whoever wishes to be counted in it must subscribe to the confession we have published, so that we have the names of our entire church in a catalog. I am sending you several copies of our confession so that you may know the reasons for our doctrine. I would also like one to be sent to Herr Calvin from you, to whom we wish all our matters to be approved, and to have our ministry here commended to the Lord in his prayers. Now the Italians will also have their own church, for which a temple and a special minister have already been appointed, a man both pious and learned, endowed with a unique gift of speaking, and who has suffered much for the glory of Christ. The ministers of the Germans are Gwalther Deloenus, formerly the king's librarian, and Martinus Flandrus, who was among you for some time with Herr Hooper, if I am not mistaken, about whom we all greatly rejoice, because of the man's candor, simplicity, learning, and piety. The French have Franciscus Riverius and Richardus, both well-learned and eloquent.</p>
      <p>In short: we all unanimously give thanks to divine kindness for such a great benefit, and we attest our gratitude by our repentance and mutual acts of charity, and we diligently pray that what the Lord has begun here by His ineffable mercy, in these most excellent and afflicted times, He may advance to the end, and add to us His Holy Spirit, who may guide, moderate, and prosper us and all our plans in our ministry, so that the kingdom of His beloved Son may be propagated and made more illustrious through us, to the glory of His name, our salvation, and the edification of His church. Amen.</p>
      <p>We have already felt the attempts of Satan trying to disturb our institution from all sides, so much so that the matter almost led to a schism of the churches. But the Lord has now somewhat restrained his fury, and we hope for better things in the future.</p>
      <p>I am now compelled to end because of the overwhelming business. Therefore, I wish, along with all of ours, that you all there, our most esteemed teachers and brothers, may fare well in the Lord and be in the best health together with your entire church, to whose prayers we most dutifully commend ourselves. London, January 7, 1551.</p>
      <p>Most devoted to your piety from the heart, Johannes a Lasco.</p>
      <p>To the most holy man, Herr Heinrich Bullinger, most faithful minister of the ZÃ¼rich church, uniquely esteemed brother in the Lord.</p>
