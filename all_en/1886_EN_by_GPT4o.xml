      <p>Do not be surprised that the letters were sealed six days earlier than the courier departed. For in this, he neglected his promise to me that he would leave the next day.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, as before, I earnestly beseech and implore your kindness regarding the boy, that you may send your letters in return as soon as possible to the nearby baths where our fellow citizen, Fugger, resides, so that someone from his household, whoever it may be, receives them as soon as possible. Farewell for the third and finally for eternity, most splendid man in the light and ornaments of all virtues, and do not drive away Raphael, the son of an old friend and almost a brother, from your familiarity. Given on June 2.</p>
