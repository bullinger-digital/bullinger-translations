      <p>Greetings. We have received your letter along with that brief papal document.</p>
      <p>You advise and encourage us to be men. Indeed, you always do what is fitting for you, that is, to be the vigilant and magnanimous leader of the bishops. We would express our thanks, if the cause were not as much yours as ours; for we are all publicly attacked here. We have inquired diligently about this: our Tscherner has certainly learned from the merchants of Como that the impostor is now in Como, accompanied by four fat monks of great fame in Italy, with whom he will attack us as soon as he has recovered a little from the fever he is now afflicted with. We have the best hopes for our senate and city. Our consul Haimius, although an old man, responded suddenly with youthful spirit: "I wish someone would come to shake us from our lethargy and finally spur us lazy ones into action." When they arrive, we will inform you of everything, always intending to do what seems best to you. In the meantime, be assured and certain that we do not fear any of these scoundrels. Truth is strong, and we are not entirely ignorant of such struggles.</p>
      <p>Whatever happens, you will know immediately, perhaps even flying here yourself. However, we are waiting to see how they will approach the matter.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, farewell in the Lord Jesus, most humane man and most esteemed by all good people. From Chur, on the 28th day of August, 1553.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Comander and Philippus Gallicius. To the truly great man, Heinrich Bullinger, most esteemed by all good people, etc.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
