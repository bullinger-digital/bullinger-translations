    <p xml:id="regest1">After the Bernese council, prompted by Capito and Bucer, had the already printed catechism of Megander reformulated to be more concord-friendly and now demands that the conflicting pastors sign the new version, Megander and Erasmus [Ritter] face a difficult decision. Zwick disapproves, on the one hand, of the hasty revision, which could be interpreted as a retraction, and on the other hand, of the ruthless approach towards deserving pastors like Megander. He asks the people of Zurich, following a request [from Bern], to exert their influence and recommends a conference for agreement among the Swiss churches without arbitrators [Capito and Bucer]. Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings and peace of Christ.</p>
      <p>Megander, dearest men, recently wrote a catechism, which he also published and distributed in more than four hundred copies. However, when Capito and Bucer were recently advocating for concord at the Bernese, they complained somewhat that the catechism does not entirely breathe concord and that Luther might be offended if he read it, judging that it is necessary to speak and write more magnificently about the sacraments than this catechism does.</p>
      <p>Therefore, the senate of the deacons decided that it should be reviewed by Capito and Bucer, with Grynaeus, Myconius, and four ministers of the church also present, which I hear was done in many places, with the booklet being returned to the hands of the public scribe. Then it was returned to the senate, with the ministers also summoned, so that it might be re-read and a decision made about its publication. The ministers are divided, as you know.</p>
      <p>The senate is also offended by this contention. However, the decision prevailed that, since nothing contrary to the disputation and confession is found in the catechism, it should be published, and finally, that the Bernese ecclesiastics should either subscribe or cease from office. Now, however, Megander and Erasmus are faced with a dilemma: If they must subscribe, it might not be possible without offending their conscience; if they must abandon the church, it will not happen without greater offense. I write this to you, my dearest lords and brothers, so that you may assist the most illustrious church in any way possible.</p>
      <p>I do not judge the truth of the catechism here, nor do I judge Bucer and Capito, since Grynaeus and Myconius are witnesses to their cause.</p>
      <p>There are two things that offend me in the name of this business: First, that after the first catechism was published and, if I am not mistaken, spread throughout the entire dominion, immediately and at once another is imposed, by which example many cannot help but be offended and the prior catechism is drawn into bad suspicions. And such sudden changes are altogether odious and breathe a certain recantation, even if they are not manifest. Reformations are not to be condemned, but they should be instituted in such a way that they are free from the vice of inconstancy, which prudence teaches; golden apples are in silver dishes, a word spoken in due season. The second thing that offends is that the Bernese immediately remove from office all who cannot subscribe to this business. For it is possible for a man to be good, learned, pious, and upright, who nevertheless cannot solidly grasp what is often done; is he therefore to be dismissed? Is this how we learn to bear one another's burdens? This grace is sometimes repaid to those who have served the church well. Whatever Megander's disposition, the Bernese church owes him much. If there were someone contentious in the church, a bridle could be put on him, either so that he would not object to the decision received by the church or so that he would remain silent on this or any other cause.</p>
      <p>If he would not wish this, then a dismissal would be excusable for the sake of avoiding division. I confess there are many things beyond my understanding; if I wish to disturb the church in these matters, I am not to be tolerated, but if I cannot subscribe to whatever (which in my judgment do not seem solid) without disturbing the church, am I therefore unworthy of ecclesiastical function?</p>
      <p>You have my thoughts in brief, and although I would prefer to remain silent in these matters, charity for the churches has overcome me, and finally, I have been asked. I wanted to write these few things to you about this matter. It is your task, through yourselves or your efforts, to ensure that good and most learned brothers are not forced to abandon the church on this occasion. Certainly, it would not seem unwise if the Swiss churches were to come together solidly in a synod, with all arbitrators removed.</p>
      <p>May the peace of Christ be with you, and may His spirit lead you into all truth. Amen. Farewell in the Lord.</p>
      <p>From Konstanz, January 4, 1538.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted</p>
      <p>Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>Our consul Thomas Blarer, brother Konrad, and all the fellow ministers greet you, praying that throughout the entire course of the following year you may be most fortunate in the Lord.</p>
      <p>To the lords Heinrich Bullinger, Leo, Pellican, and Theodor, my dearest lords and brothers.</p>
