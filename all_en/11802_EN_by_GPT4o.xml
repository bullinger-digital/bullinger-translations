    <p xml:id="regest1">Bullinger was only bothered with questions [Nr. 1751] because he himself was asked about the truthfulness of news from Zurich; he was pleased to hear what happened to the red-haired monk [in Uri]; since Bullinger only considers useful information worth sharing, Myconius writes nothing about Pierre Caroli, but he feels confirmed in his distrust of France. The pastor of Bubikon [Johannes Stumpf] provided more details about [Christoph] Klauser while passing through; Klauser's fate teaches Myconius the fear of God. Bucer will probably only return [to Strasbourg] once his deputy Hedio [in Bonn] has arrived; Myconius will take care of [forwarding] Bullinger's letter [to Bucer]. Rudolf [Gwalther] is rightly skeptical about what the Emperor [Charles V] will bring to Germany; the war [of Duke William] of Jülich is said to be related to his arrival, and a French army is said to have gathered in Picardy; it is said that [King Francis I] and Count William [of Fürstenberg] have threatened each other with death; troops are being recruited near Basel to oppose the Emperor, who had artillery transported on the Rhine. King Ferdinand needs soldiers to defend Vienna; Captain [Hans Othmar von Schönau] from Laufenburg reported that Italians are on their way there; more than all these war rumors, however, Myconius is troubled by the widespread disregard for the Gospel, in which some [pastors?] are not blameless.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I ask for your forgiveness, dearest friend, if I inquire about something that you cannot provide without neglecting your own affairs. Indeed, I have asked for nothing for myself recently, but for those who inquire of me about the truth of events that usually occur in Zurich.</p>
      <p>In the future, I will be more prudent. Meanwhile, I was very pleased to hear the story about the red-haired monk. If you could listen with the same spirit about Pierre Caroli, I would write without hesitation; but since you also seek usefulness, I think it best to remain silent. From this, I have indeed learned to fear the French more, and it confirms for me what someone once wrote: that France harbors monsters.</p>
      <p>The pastor in Bubikon said everything about Clauser - for he recently passed through here - so there is no need for me to know more. That man will serve as an example to me as long as I live. Since his life was very well known to me, I could not admire enough what happened. We see from this how diligently we must walk in the fear of the Lord. I pray to Him to restore and protect him in the future.</p>
      <p>Bucer is expected any day now; he will succeed Hedio for a period of six months, so that Hedio can rest in the meantime, although it seems to me that Bucer will not leave Bonn until another is present. As for your matters, I will handle them properly.</p>
      <p>Since I never cease to hear about the Emperor's impiety, I am almost of the opinion, like our Rudolf, that nothing good will come to Germany. They say that the war by the Duke of Jülich is being renewed because of his arrival. In Solothurn, it is reported that the French have gathered an army in Picardy of up to one hundred thousand. It is also said for certain that the French king has announced to Count William that wherever he falls into his hands, he will be put to death by the slowest means, namely by hanging; the count, in turn, said that the king should beware, for he will continue in the Emperor's service and, wherever he finds him, will use the same kind of death that he has used against the evangelicals up to this day.</p>
      <p>Several banners of soldiers are being assembled around us to go against the Emperor and lead him I know not where. It is said that he has sent down 108 large cannons via the Rhine.</p>
      <p>King Ferdinand is seeking to send reinforcements to the Viennese; he fears a siege. Recently, a captain from Laufenburg was here, not the least of those who are to go there. He asserted that six thousand Italians are already on their way to Vienna. These are the rumors of wars; but there is no end yet. I am not as troubled by these rumors as by the fact that the Gospel is held in such little honor among us. The auditoriums are very crowded; the fruits you see are none, everything is full of scandals. And indeed, when I look at the matter with clear eyes, some among us contribute not a little to this misfortune. May the Lord Jesus correct us. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell with all yours in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, June 21, 1543.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To the most excellent and learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, in his Lord. Zurich.</p>
