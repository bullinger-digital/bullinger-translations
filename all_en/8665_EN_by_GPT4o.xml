      <p>Greetings. At the same hour I received your letter, honorable man, I wrote this one.</p>
      <p>Mr. Haller, having been afflicted by a domestic illness as if it were too familiar, is bedridden and, having called me to him, offered the writings of Erastus and yours along with his letters. As I was reading them, a messenger arrived indicating departure. Therefore, having set aside all writings, I at least wrote this so that you would know we received all of yours. I will read them diligently and return them to you as soon as possible. They will not be shared by me indeed; for I owe you much, honorable man, for this reason, and I would not have asked if Mr. Erastus had not been the author of it for me; for I am pleased with your wise counsel on alleviating the cost of grain throughout Switzerland. Let the political magistrates consult for the benefit of the republic, we with the amendment of life, the ministers with vigorous and pious exhortation, and there is no doubt, if each of us diligently performs our duty, that the Lord will grant success. With prayers, God must be invoked... the enormous crimes of this world, etc. Farewell.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man and well-deserving of the Church of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, honorable lord and friend.</p>
      <p>In ZÃ¼rich.</p>
