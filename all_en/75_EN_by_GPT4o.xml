    <p xml:id="regest1">This Spaniard, the bearer of the letter [Fernando Díaz Paterniano], was for a time in the service of Francisco de Enzinas. He wishes to meet the people of Zurich himself because he has heard so many good things about them. Bullinger should receive him well and also recommend him in Myconius' name to the pious couple John Hooper and Anne, née t'Serclaes. He will be very welcome to them, especially since they have known him for a long time. He may stay in Zurich for a while.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">It may surprise Bullinger that Enzinas moved to Strasbourg, married [Margarethe, née Elter], and now wants to emigrate to England. For he actually had the plan to go to Constantinople due to his uncertain situation in Germany, about which Myconius had spoken with him at length.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">Emperor Charles V is said to have dismissed the princes for two months [from the Diet of Augsburg], but on the condition that they will then return to that place which he will still determine (probably Strasbourg, as is believed). The Emperor will cure himself with guaiac wood tea until then, in order to be able to once again cover Germany with wars against the Hanseatic cities of Bremen, Magdeburg, and Brunswick along with their allies. Or he will fortify Brabant against possible attacks.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">In England, everything is going well so far. Bernardino Ochino and Peter Martyr Vermigli have obtained positions there, and the former Jew Immanuel Tremellius is also being called there for Hebrew instruction. This also applies to other servants of the Strasbourg church and school, especially since they are in danger. If the Emperor were to go to Strasbourg, even for a short time, it would not be surprising if all righteous people and scholars fled! How pleasing to God that would be is easy to judge... Nevertheless, people would be in great distress due to the imperial tyranny!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">It is to be hoped that Martin Bucer will now return home to Strasbourg. However, whether he will be received favorably there, Myconius cannot assess.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">Rumors are circulating. What it is really about, Myconius may only find out when it is unfortunately already too late.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">Greetings, also to Bullinger's family and to Rudolf Gwalther.</p>

      <p>Greetings. Here is the Spaniard. He was for some time with Dryander, now he has left. He has heard many good things about you. Therefore, he wanted to see in person those whom he has heard so highly praised. I ask you to have him recommended. You will also commend him to Hooper and his most pious wife in my name. They have known each other for some time. Therefore, his recommendation will be more welcome. Perhaps he will stay with you for a while.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>You will hear things about Dryander that you would not have expected: He conversed with me for a long time, he wanted to go to Constantinople because there was no place for him in Germany. Finally, he went to Strasbourg and married, intending to go to England.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>They say the Emperor has dismissed the princes for two months on the condition that they return again when called to the place he will designate. They think this place is Strasbourg. In the meantime, he will drink guaiac wood tea, so that he can again do something troublesome to Germany. He is thought to be about to invade the remaining maritime cities, Bremen, Magdeburg, and Brunswick with their allies, or fortify Brabant so that it is not invaded by others.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>In England, everything is still succeeding. Bernardino and Peter Martyr are valued there. Emanuel, once a Jew, is being called to teach Hebrew there. Some others from the church and school of Strasbourg are also being called, as danger threatens them. It is not surprising if all learned and good men flee from the Emperor, who is arranging to stay there even for a short time. How pious this would be, I think it is not difficult to judge. Nevertheless, people are thus urged by the Emperor's tyranny.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Bucer is now hoped to return home. However, with what favor he will be received, I cannot say.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>Rumors are circulating. This pains me greatly: Yet, what it is, I cannot really understand. Perhaps I will understand after it has passed.</p>

    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>Farewell in the Lord with your family and Gwalther. Basel, March 20, 1548.</p>
      <p>Yours, Os. Myco.</p>
      <p>To the most learned Heinrich Bullinger, most worthy pastor of the church of Zurich, his venerable brother in the Lord. Zurich.</p>
