    <p xml:id="regest1">[1] Haller received Bullinger's letter [from January 22, not preserved] through his relative [Konrad Kambli], to whom he also entrusted the response [No. 2786]. Another letter from Bullinger [No. 2770] was delivered by the messenger [...], who had been in Kyburg, on February 3 (one day after the departure of Haller's relative). These letters caused Haller great pain!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest2">[2] Bullinger accuses him of timidity. He urges him to bravely take up the cross, as if he wanted to run away out of fear! With the second letter, he even learned that the Zurich pastors in Augsburg [Haller, Lorenz Meyer, Thoman Ruman, and Rudolf Schwyzer the Elder] would only make themselves hated with their letters to the Zurich council. But they had already written, and twice at that. They described the situation and justified their desire to be recalled; but they also emphasized that they were willing to stay in Augsburg if the council wished. They had hoped for fatherly advice. Instead, they were slandered! If the Zurich councilors conclude timidity from their letters, they could conversely conclude from this accusation that the [disloyalty shown by the Augsburg council to the Schmalkaldic League] pleases the Zurich council!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest3">[3] Bullinger advises orienting oneself to the best men if the Augsburgers [Emperor Charles V] should make disgraceful concessions. But the best among these men is Georg Frölich! It was he who asked Blarer and Bullinger for advice, as he also wanted to leave Augsburg but did not receive permission and therefore stayed. So why are Haller and his colleagues being reproached for thinking they had to leave Augsburg? Finally, Haller also decided to stay in Augsburg, as he was not allowed to send his family back to Zurich. By the way, it was Frölich who advised the Zurich pastors to effect their recall by the Zurich council. And where are now Sebastian Schertlin (a key figure of the war), Bernardino Ochino, and Francesco Stancaro? Their departure from Augsburg caused no offense!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest4">[4] Bullinger's accusation is all the more astonishing, especially since the pious in Augsburg rightly call those timid who submit to the emperor to be able to stay in Augsburg without being exposed to danger. In contrast, those who do not agree to the treacherous peace are considered steadfast. Thus, Haller and his colleagues are considered steadfast in Augsburg, but timid in Zurich, where the circumstances are not known!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest5">[5] The brave Michael Keller, who had to endure much in Augsburg and is the only one upholding the pure doctrine of the Lord's Supper, is also preparing his departure and encourages all the pious to do so. Wolfgang Musculus and Sebastian Lepusculus hold similar views.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest6">[6] What to do? The Zurich pastors in Augsburg thought that the failure of the Augsburgers would displease the Zurichers and that they would therefore recall their pastors from Augsburg. But now these pastors are in a bind: In Zurich, they are accused of timidity for wanting to leave Augsburg; in Augsburg, they would have been called cowardly if they had not wanted to leave!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest7">[7] As long as the Augsburg council resisted the emperor, Haller was in good spirits. But now, as the council claims there is no longer any danger due to the peace agreement, he no longer knows quite what to do. Is that timidity? How painful it is now to be accused of this! It is probably the ignorance of the facts that underlies such a presumptuous judgment.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest8">[8] Bullinger should change his opinion about Haller and defend him. Haller could not act otherwise, especially since the other pious people behaved similarly and the latter know the citizens of Augsburg and the conditions there better than the Zurichers. By the way, the Zurich council would have reproached him if he had not listened to the advice of the good people in Augsburg. He acted on Frölich's advice and will continue to do so. Moreover, the conversation of the Zurich pastors with the Augsburg mayors Jakob Herbrot and Hans Welser, also initiated on Frölich's advice, was beneficial. It forced the mayors to behave more moderately to prevent a popular uprising due to a possible departure of the Zurichers. The conversation also made the mayors understand how little the handover of the city pleased the Zurichers; in this context, Haller must again condemn the insolence of Schwyzer, who during the conversation so offended Herbrot that he [later] said in the presence of Haller's relative that the council would not hold Schwyzer back if he wanted to leave; but Haller should stay.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest9">[9] Haller also believes that one should take up the cross. He is ready to die and go to Christ. It is known that the way to heaven leads through tribulation and steadfastness brings victory. But in the current situation, it is not about shedding one's blood for Christ. Rather, there are fears of civil uprisings and bad treaties, and it is also clear that with the arrival of the emperor in Augsburg, the gospel will be somewhat suppressed, under the pretext of edification.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest10">[10] Today, the Augsburgers are dismissing the [remaining] soldiers. In two days, the imperial garrison is to move in. Where the city used to spend money on the gospel, it will now have to spend money against the gospel. Haller knows exactly that Bullinger would also leave Augsburg! But according to Bullinger's and the Zurich council's wish, he will stay in Augsburg, and even with good will! Without complaining, he will fulfill his duties, support the pious remnant of the church, and entrust everything to the Lord, as nothing is to be expected from people. May the Lord grant him His spirit!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest11">[11] Finally, it seems important to him to explain why there are contradictory statements within his own letters and between his letters and those of others. It often happened that even on the same day, very different news arrived. Furthermore, the bailiff of Kyburg [Bernhard von Cham] received contradictory news from the letters of Haller and Hans Wilpert Zoller, which can be explained as follows: Sebastian Schertlin was with his soldiers outside the city gates, calling them to repentance, a decent life, and perseverance, assuring them that the city dwellers were steadfast. But soon the Great Council met. Haller was then secretly informed by the city clerk Frölich about the plans the council was hatching, so he could immediately warn the Zurichers, while Zoller continued to report on the steadfastness of the Augsburgers. For similar reasons, there were also discrepancies between Haller's letters to Bullinger and those to his father-in-law [Ulrich Kambli]. However, in his latest letters, there should hardly be any more contradictory news.</p>
    <p xml:id="regest12">[12] It is very regrettable that the old Kambli passed on Haller's letter to the Zurich council, especially since this became Haller's downfall. If he does not write to Kambli, it is held against him; if he does write, such terrible consequences arise!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest13">[13] Bullinger had already warned against the surgeon Jakob Ruf at the outbreak of the war. However, Haller could not completely break off contact with him due to the family relationship and the past favors shown. But he wrote only very rarely and reported only harmless things, as he was aware of Ruf's talkativeness!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest14">[14] Bullinger should receive this justification, written in haste, well. It was written with all his heart and in great trust. If Bullinger would only understand him! Then he would think differently about him. And if he considers him innocent, then others will too. In some places, Haller has become quite vehement in his letter; this is due to his pain. Bullinger should forgive this and remain favorably disposed towards him!</p>
    <p xml:id="regest15">[15] Nikolaus Müller, known as Maier (whom Haller saw today), who is also considering leaving Augsburg, sends his regards; as do Georg Frölich, Meyer, Ruman, and Schwyzer the Elder. Haller instructed the last three to also write to Bullinger. Since Meyer and Schwyzer left their wives [...] in Zurich, they now plan to return before a possible recall, despite Haller's resistance. Whether they will actually do so is questionable. They accuse him of great timidity [because he does not want to leave Augsburg without a recall]. According to them, he should have written to Zurich even more often (also on their behalf). But he has to bear the consequences! Greetings to Konrad Pellikan, Theodor Bibliander, and Rudolf Gwalther. If they think poorly of Haller, Bullinger should change their minds. Greetings also to Anna [née Adlischwyler] and the children, as well as to his brother Wolfgang.</p>

      <p>S. D. I received two letters from you, venerable father: one was brought by my relative, to whom I also responded; the other was delivered to me on February 3rd, after my relatives had left the day before, brought by the messenger who had been in Kyburg. How much pain these letters caused me cannot be expressed!</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div2" corresp="regest2">
      <p>You accuse me of timidity. You command me to regain my spirit, to take up the cross, as if I had ever been timid, lost my spirit, or wanted to flee the cross with dishonor. You add in your later letters (speaking in the manner of scripture) that we would make our name stink among both the pious and the impious if we wrote to the Zurich council. But we wrote twice, letters we never expected to be gnawed at by Theon's teeth! We explained the current state of affairs. We enumerated the reasons for which we seek to be recalled. But what we have achieved is apparent from your letters. We appealed to them as fathers to be recalled, if it pleased them - asking to stay, if they wished, not denying. It was better to consult than to insult, to encourage than to detract! If they can gather from our letters that we are timid, we can also gather from their judgments that they are treacherous and that this inconstancy pleases them.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div3" corresp="regest3">
      <p>You advise, among other things, that if they commit any indignity, I should do what I see the best do. But among the best, whom should I place more than our Mr. Laetus? What did he do? He wrote to Blaurer, he wrote to you, he sought advice, he sought a place for himself. Why then, when we did the same, is it held against us? He also constantly sought pardon from the lords; when he did not obtain it, he decided to stay until he had another opportunity. We did this too, and when I did not obtain that my family be dismissed, I also stayed to see the outcome. Laetus is indeed seeking a way and reason to leave. We thought his example would suffice for us, so that what was praised in him would not be blamed in us. I add that we used his advice in writing and seeking pardon. I will give other good examples: Schertlin, the heart of the whole war, did he not leave? Where are the most pious Bernardino and the most learned Stancaro? They left, declaring no timidity nor giving offense to the church.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div4" corresp="regest4">
      <p>Therefore, with pain, I wonder how you can conclude that I am timid, when among us all the pious at this time call those timid who willingly submit to the emperor to avoid danger. Conversely, they consider it a sign of great constancy if someone does not agree to these unjust conditions and treacherous peace. We are considered all the more constant here, as you consider us more dejected! Therefore, since you either do not know or have not considered the circumstances, you judge our timidity so rashly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div5" corresp="regest5">
      <p>Cellarius, a man most constant and magnanimous in adverse circumstances, who alone preserved the purity of the gospel here through various storms and trials in this city, has prepared his departure and advised all the good to do the same. He considered all those who wanted to stay as flatterers and sycophants. Musculus the same; Lepusculus similarly.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div6" corresp="regest6">
      <p>What should we do? We thought that this defection would displease you so much that you would not allow us to stay here if we wanted to. But now we are caught between a rock and a hard place: On one hand, you shout and proclaim us fearful; here, if we had acted otherwise, we would have been considered fearful. What should be done in the end?</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div7" corresp="regest7">
      <p>I testify to God that I have never been more spirited than when they said they wanted to persevere steadfastly and try every fortune rather than surrender to the emperor, and never more troubled than when I heard that all dangers had been removed with the peace agreement. Is this timidity? Whoever speaks of me in this way does me great injustice. But ignorance is a bold evil; it dares to pronounce wrongly on unknown matters, which I experience with great pain in this matter.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div8" corresp="regest8">
      <p>Therefore, venerable father, I ask you not to suspect such things of me and to defend my innocence even among others. In truth, I could not have acted otherwise, as all the other good people acted similarly - who indeed, being with us, see what will happen; who know our citizens and are aware of all other circumstances, can judge and advise better than you (pardon the expression). However, while I follow their advice, I am forced to hear such things from you! If I did not want to obey them, so as not to be ill-spoken of by you, I would offend them and place myself between a rock and a hard place. For I know what you would have imputed to me if I did not follow their advice. Therefore, I did what Laetus advised, and I will continue to do so. It was not a little beneficial that we approached the consuls: For they were forced to act more strictly, lest a tumult arise with our departure, and to see how little this surrender pleased us - although I cannot but again accuse the shameless rashness of Rudolf Schwyzer, who so offended Herbrot with his foolishness that he said in the presence of my relative that the lords would not retain him if he wanted to leave, but did not want to dismiss me. Therefore, I ask you, by Christ whom we serve, to persuade yourself otherwise about me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div9" corresp="regest9">
      <p>You write learnedly, holily, and Christianly about bearing the cross; nor am I otherwise affected. I desire to be dissolved and to be with Christ. I know that through many afflictions one must enter the kingdom of heaven. I know that if we die, we will also live. But the matter is not such that it is allowed to freely shed blood for Christ. I fear only tumult, internal seditions of the citizens, unjust and disgraceful treaties, and I do not doubt that when the emperor comes to the city, the gospel will be somewhat bound under the pretext of edification, but truly of destruction. Here I am stuck; this moves me.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div10" corresp="regest10">
      <p>Today our soldiers are being dismissed. Within two days, the imperial troops will come to garrison the city. Now we are forced to give money against the gospel, which we previously gave to defend the gospel. I know, I know you would shake the dust off your feet! But since it pleases you and the most honorable council of Zurich, I will stay, and gladly indeed! I will do my duty, complain no more, lest I again fall into this name most alien to me. I will lay everything before the Lord and commit it to Him, for I see no hope or salvation to be placed in men. I will use the advice that time, circumstances, and place will give me. I will flee the wicked as much as I can. I will faithfully assist all the pious, if at least some part of the sincere church can be preserved. May the Lord grant me His spirit, as He has graciously done so far.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div11" corresp="regest11">
      <p>Finally, it seems necessary to write back, as it greatly moves you, the dissonance of my letters, or of my letters and those of others. This discrepancy will be easily reconciled if you observe the state of affairs. It happens that we have different things on the same day: that sometimes I wrote joyful things, with all the citizens knowing nothing else; soon the post arrives, bringing something else. Hence, the letters vary, especially if they are written two, three days, or even a whole week apart. The Kyburg bailiff also wonders at the dissonance of my letters and those of his Zoller. But this is the cause: Schertlin led all the soldiers out before the gates into the field and informed them of the citizens' constancy, urging them in turn to repentance, honesty, and constancy; hence they rejoiced and promised themselves nothing else from the citizens. The next day, the great council was held. What had been hidden until then was proposed. When I immediately learned of this secretly from the city clerk, I wrote about the dangers and the peace to be made on the same day that he wrote about the constancy of the Augsburgers. Thus it often happened to me, who, wanting to delight you with everything by writing, seem to be different to you due to different accidental matters. Therefore, I ask you to have me excused in this part as well. This was also the cause of the discrepancy between those I wrote to you and those I wrote to my father-in-law. However, I think your later letters will have no dissonance with my father-in-law's.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div12" corresp="regest12">
      <p>That the good old man delivered the letters to the council, I am very sorry, and all the more so, the more they interpreted them in a bad way. It bothers him if I write nothing to him, and when I write, it stirs such a storm! If anything was wrong in this part, I want to correct it.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div13" corresp="regest13">
      <p>I wrote sparingly to the surgeon, whom you warned me about at the beginning of the war. However, I cannot completely reject him due to the closeness of kinship and his many services and benefits to me. I write such things that cannot harm. For I know how full of leaks he is.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div14" corresp="regest14">
      <p>Please, consider this my excuse with fairness and goodness. I wrote hastily, but from the heart. If only you knew my mind! I do not doubt that you would think differently of me. I wrote somewhat more confidently to you because I love you and revere you as a father and because I know that if I am cleared with you, I can easily be excused with others. What I wrote somewhat more vehemently, pain compelled me. Therefore, forgive and continue to love me as you have so far.</p>
    </div>
    <div xml:id="div15" corresp="regest15">
      <p>Farewell. Mr. Nikolaus Maier, who is also of a very doubtful mind (I was with him today), also greets you, as do Mr. Laetus and our three brothers. I instructed them to write to you as well, for Laurentius and Rudolf, since they do not have their wives with them, had decided to leave before the call, even against my resistance, and accuse me of being more timid, as I am reluctant to leave the church. But I do not know whether they will do so or not. They urged me to write more frequently, even in their name. Now all the blame falls on me. I wish the lords, brothers, and fathers Pellikan, Bibliander, and Gwalther well, among whom I ask you to clear me and remove any suspicion they may have conceived of me. May your wife and children also be safe. I commend my brother to you. Augsburg, February 3, 1547. Johannes Haller, most devoted to you.</p>
      <p>To the most faithful doctor of the city of Zurich, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, his lord and venerable father. Zürich, to Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
