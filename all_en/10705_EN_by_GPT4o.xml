    <p xml:id="regest1">The Solothurn "bandits" have not actually declared a feud against their hometown, but have only renounced a peace that is unacceptable to them. However, the resolution of this conflict is certainly in the interest of all parties involved. Haller welcomes a mediation attempt by Zurich and is ready to make contact with the exiles through [Crispinus Fischer].</p>

      <p>Grace and peace from God.</p>
      <p>Especially beloved lord and brother, I always perceive your constant zeal and seriousness, as well as great diligence, which you bear towards all those who not only strive in the truth of godliness but also those who stand in danger for the sake of justice and truth, whose hearts God knows. Regarding the exiles from Solothurn, the situation is as follows: They are not allowed to be found in our lord's territory, which greatly burdens the unity of the 10 places, even though they have never offended any of them, but have behaved as loyal confederates should, and as many of their people are capable, for others. They have not declared a feud against the city of Solothurn, but have renounced a peace that is unbearable for them, for if they ever intended to be open enemies of their fatherland, they could have shown such with other hostile acts, such as robbing, burning, killing, etc. In summary: They have let it go over foreign priests. Now, let it be as it may. Neither the city of Solothurn nor they can endure this conflict for long, and it is also burdensome to my gracious lords, as their territory is large and wide with many offenses. Therefore, at this moment, no greater work and reward from God could happen, also for the good of a confederation, than if this conflict were resolved. I know so much about it that I fear, even if the exiles retreat for a time now, they will not desist in the future if they are not valued; it will only get worse over time. Now, the good-hearted will of those you find in the city of Zurich will, as I hope, achieve and bear much fruit. For a city like Zurich will not only be agreeable to the exiles but also to those from Solothurn, to hear a friendly treaty, yes, I think, also our gracious lords will receive it with great thanks. However, I will ensure that this opinion is presented to them as soon as possible. I do not know, nor can I find out, where they are, as they do not stay in one place. But I will certainly ensure that it is made known to them. Everyone fears them wherever they go; they are, as I hear, very close to Solothurn's territory. Nevertheless, I will ensure in a very short time that you will receive a definite answer. We hereby ask you not to cease urging our lords of Zurich to show themselves in this matter as pious and honorable people, who are very skilled and agreeable in making peace in this matter. There is a trusted heart friend here in our city, who has a friend among the exiles, through whom I will arrange everything. Do not cease, so that one may come to rest.</p>
      <p>With that, entrusted to God.</p>
      <p>28th of October, in the year 35.</p>
      <p>Berchtold Haller.</p>
      <p>To Heinrich Bullinger, the most vigilant pastor of the church in Zurich, his brother to be observed with utmost love.</p>
