      <p>To his most friendly and esteemed Lord Bullinger, Friedrich von Salis sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Yesterday, having returned to my family home from the Venetian legation, I found your letters, and upon reading them, I was filled with the greatest joy, especially because I learned from them that you and your family, and finally my son, are in good health. Therefore, I give immense thanks to the most good and great God and pray that He may grant us this joy perpetually. Furthermore, regarding what you wrote about my letters, which I had given to Peter Perna in Venice to be delivered to you, being opened in Milan and then taken to the cardinal, and thus you fear that some plot might be laid against me on the journey, and you advise me to be cautious - for being so concerned for me, my excellent Lord Bullinger, I owe you much and equally give thanks. But to relieve you of your concern, as you command, I want you to know that, by God's goodness, I have succeeded most happily and completed my legation with decorum, as I hope. For I have achieved most of what I sought.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in the future, all our confederates, neighbors, and subjects of the illustrious Three Leagues of the Rhaetians, except those born in the Venetian domain and consequently subjects of the Venetians, have safe access to the dominion of the most illustrious Venetians, provided they remain silent, do not dispute about religion, and do not carry prohibited books, they will not be disturbed by the inquisitors for the sake of religion, and they may believe whatever they wish. And thus they will be able to safely engage in trade and any other business in the Venetian dominion. And indeed, this was obtained beyond all hope of those who favor our religion.</p>
      <p>Moreover, regarding the property of our Bellinchettos, which had been taken from them by the sentence of the inquisitors and adjudged to the treasury, it was obtained from the most illustrious Venetian senate that the property should serve the father of the Bellinchettos and, upon his death, pass to his sons. As for the other matters I conducted in the name of my lords, I do not write more extensively, because I know you do not care to be informed of them. I only do not conceal that I was received very kindly by the Venetians and well dispatched, and even liberally gifted, so that they indeed demonstrated their benevolent judgments towards our Rhaetia in every respect. And thus, having successfully completed my affairs, I returned to my homeland, where I also found my entire family and all who favor me in good health. Therefore, the Lord God is to be praised; to Him be honor and glory forever.</p>
      <p>As for new things to write, I have this: The Guise army, called by the pope from the March of Ancona and the territory of Ferrara, went to Rome on the second day of August. It is believed that this was done to bring aid to the city of Paliano, surrounded by a long siege, and therefore a messenger was daily expected in Venice regarding a conflict to be made about this matter. The Lord of Guise did not go to Rome, because he was said to be ill; but he delegated his duties to his brother, the Lord of Mala. However, the Duke of Ferrara is in danger, as it is reported that by the order of Philip, King of the English, war is being prepared against him, and the main responsibility for this is said to have been entrusted to Duke Octavius Farnese, and furthermore, the Duke of Florence is to provide 6000 soldiers and a certain number of horsemen at his own expense, likewise the King of the Romans (which, however, is not believed by the more sensible) will also provide a large number of soldiers. The Marquis of Pescara is intent on recruiting soldiers at Mantua, and this is also being done at Correggio. In short, it seems that many princes are preparing everything for the ruin of the Duke of Ferrara.</p>
      <p>But he himself is also busy preparing the necessary things for his defense, and it is even said that he is going to send envoys to Switzerland (if he has not already sent them) to implore military aid; for he sees himself completely deserted by the Guise army. All true Christians (I mean those who are Christians in deed and truth and not feignedly) think that vengeance remains upon him for the cruelty, not to say impiety, he used towards his most honorable wife; for you know how he dealt with her concerning religion.</p>
      <p>Regarding the Turk, it is rumored that his fleet has attacked Calabria and taken away 4000 captives and returned to Valona, and it was doubted whether the same fleet would return towards Calabria and Naples. The Venetians, as the most prudent of all, with lynx-like eyes intent on every single thing, have their fleet prepared, so that, if necessary, it can be brought out to sea with minimal expense; but they also have troops of soldiers and horsemen conscripted everywhere in the interior, so that they may be prepared for any event both on land and sea in these perilous times.</p>
      <p>Otherwise, they are peaceful and tranquil on all sides, and indeed they alone now enjoy a golden age, while the rest of Italy is tormented and burning with the hardships of war. May the Lord God grant that the Venetians may use this happiness perpetually; for truly that most illustrious republic is such that it indeed has no equal in the administration of its dominion. For it is subject to no rashness; but they handle each and every matter with the most exact judgment, great maturity, and finally the utmost experience of affairs.</p>
      <p>I would very much wish that you could have been a spectator of their government for some time, as I have been; you would indeed praise their most outstanding prudence and exquisite observance of all things. But I would wish even more, my Lord Bullinger, that our common countrymen would likewise be united in the administration of their republic and, with all private affections and favors of foreign princes set aside, as the Venetians do, would consider what would be beneficial to the advantage, honor, and pure liberty of their country. But we must also pray to the Lord God that He may suggest His grace to all, both the Swiss and the Rhaetians, that they may finally do this diligently; for truly, unless He puts forth His hand, we see our republic on both sides somewhat and daily being undermined. For we are indeed more devoted and subject to foreign princes and private advantage than is proper, indeed than (in my judgment) is beneficial to our country. But enough of this; for I have gone further than I intended.</p>
      <p>Indeed, my most distinguished and most esteemed Lord Bullinger, I long to see you and do not know how long I can restrain myself from visiting you and my son. However, I do not dare to set a definite day; for I would not want to fail in my promise.</p>
      <p>But by Hercules, I do not think the age will pass without me meeting you in person. In the meantime, take care to be well with your whole family, and if ever the opportunity arises, please cheer me with your letters, for there are none, believe me, that are more pleasing to me than yours, which, because they are by far the most delightful to me, I repeatedly kiss.</p>
      <p>My son also wrote to me three letters at once in a style, so to speak, trilingual. And indeed I was very pleased, but I would be more delighted if he had composed them by his own effort; for what is written in Latin and German is written quite neatly; but I suspect he was (as is customary) assisted by some more skilled companion. You will therefore advise him not to be afraid to bring forth from his own workshop whatever he can, and not to borrow from others. For in this way he will improve better day by day, and I will also certainly feel his progress with joy and will also consider everything favorably from time to time; for indeed neither does one day bring spring nor one swallow return, etc. Forgive me, my most esteemed Lord Bullinger, if I have been too lengthy; for I cannot act otherwise; for while I write, I seem to converse with you, and thus the ardor of conversing with you more extensively does not allow me to observe the decorum of a letter, although otherwise, due to the business with which I am pressed, I scarcely have time to write more extensively. Therefore, I pray, consider it favorably.</p>
      <p>I am writing to Lord Johann Fabricius, from whom I wish to be informed that he is well; for I love and beseech the man for his learning and piety, and especially because he is most devoted to my Lord Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Farewell again and again, the glory and singular ornament of all Switzerland, and love me mutually, as you are accustomed to do for your great humanity, and greet all your household in my name, and likewise my little son, who, if he needs anything that can be provided by me (for in other matters I know you do not fail him, as you are like the best of fathers to him), write, and I will certainly carry out whatever you wish. Given at Samaden in Upper Engadine on the last day of August 1557.</p>
      <p>Postscript.</p>
      <p>I ask you to inform Rodolph de Wysenbach that I have sent letters to his printer in Poschiavo, and as soon as I have a response, I will write back to him. Furthermore, I pray that, if you can, without inconvenience, inform Mr. Peter Perna of my return and how I have succeeded; for I know that this will be very pleasing to him. However, if it is not possible, I would not want to trouble you.</p>
      <p>Farewell again.</p>
      <p>The same as above, most devoted to you, Friedrich von Salis.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and distinguished man, Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my most esteemed and respected lord and patron. Zurich.</p>
      <p>To the highly learned Lord Heinrich Bullinger, my kind and dear lord in Zurich. Note v.</p>
      <p>What he obtained from the Venetian magistrate.</p>
