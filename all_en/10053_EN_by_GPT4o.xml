This is followed by a detailed comparison of celibacy and marriage based on 1 Corinthians 7:25ff and then, within the framework of an extensive interpretation of Psalm 127, the praise of the marriage of a God-fearing person.</p>

      <p>To the honorable and pious Anna Adlischwyler, my special grace and peace from God through Christ.</p>
      <p>Some time ago, you mentioned that I had written to you about your youth, which I did not do at the time, but I understood that it would not be unpleasant for you. Since you have served me, and I have never left a service unrewarded, you must also be rewarded and now receive what you once hoped for; and may God grant that my instruction brings much good to you. Accept my service in the best way and may the grace of God be with you.</p>
      <p>Given on St. Matthias' Day in the year 1528.</p>
      <p>Man is composed of spirit or soul and body. The noble, divine part is the soul, the source and origin, also the essence of all human actions, so that when the soul is rightly formed, the body and its actions are not lacking. Therefore, it is fitting that we first show how the soul of man should be formed; then the body will also have its prescription.</p>
      <p>So now set your thoughts on the eternal and think thus: well, you see that nothing on this earth is eternal, not even man himself, who is first and foremost subject to diseases and death, therefore you must also die. If there is no other life than this one we are in, then we are the most miserable creatures. But there is a future and better life, as seen in all pious believers and in Paul, Hebrews chapter 11. But how must man behave to attain a better life? Undoubtedly thus: adhere to the one who is immortal and can give a better life. That is the one God.</p>
      <p>You must imagine God as the only one who created everything alone and still works everything in all, almighty, who wishes well for the human race, has counted all your hairs, sees you all the time and always, to whom nothing, not even the secret thoughts of your heart, is hidden, who knows everything, is in all things, created you so that you recognize him, have him as your God, that is, have him as such a good, in whom you find the desire of your heart and what you desire, therefore also sent his only son Jesus, our Lord, into the world, and that we always carry him in our hearts, always and in all things call upon him, cling to him alone and serve him alone and rightly.</p>
      <p>So one clings to God and does not serve God with such worthless things and monkey games as previously mentioned, with masses, singing, reading, ringing, habits, vows, monasteries, images, offerings, adorning, candle burning, fasting, wafer prayers, running to saints, tearing out hair, with papal, paternal and council statutes, commands and prohibitions, which are all of no use and an abomination before God, the deception of people and our conscience's hellish torment.</p>
      <p>True worship of God consists in faith, hope, and love [1 Cor 13:13]. True worship of God is not in external, but much more in the internal workings of the soul. Through faith and hope, we cling firmly to God, trust in him, recognize him and call upon him, also persevere, are patient in all suffering and grateful in joys; thus we are never separated from God, do everything in his name. We also strive for innocence before him, cleanse ourselves from vices, suppress desires, restrain our gaze, master our tongues, and do everything that is fitting for loving people. Of this, John speaks in his epistle [1 John 2:3ff; 3:11ff; 4:7 ff].</p>
      <p>Thus the true believer strives to improve daily, to put away all wrong. He fights every moment, is never secure or at rest, for he knows that when he tramples the evil impure desires, pride lies in the field, and when it is overcome, laziness lies there. And if we perhaps fall into sins, that wickedness or despair attacks us, against this faith, prayer, and earnest struggle must fight, as Paul mentions to the Ephesians in chapter 6 [10ff].</p>
      <p>We must be well informed about these things, which helps us if we diligently adhere to the word of God. Therefore, a Christian daughter should be well practiced in the Bible, for that is the scripture of which Paul writes to Timothy: "All scripture given by God is useful for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that a man of God may be perfect, equipped for every good work" [2 Tim 3:16f]. And to the Romans:</p>
      <p>"What is written beforehand is written for our learning, that we through patience and comfort of the scriptures might have hope," Romans 15:4.</p>
      <p>There is also a special way to read the Bible with profit. Namely, it is necessary that you begin reading with prayer, yes, also pray while reading, that God may open your mind, that you may recognize his will and be improved through your reading. Furthermore, it is to be known that there are certain key points on which the whole scripture hinges, and the Old Testament begins with the covenant that God made with Abraham and in him with all his believers, that he alone is the only good, the treasure of all goods, to which we should cling alone and walk blamelessly before him [Gen 17:1ff]. To this end, all histories, all prophets now reach. These now testify how many walked blamelessly before God, how they clung to God alone, called upon him alone, and how God was their God, how he served them all needs, protected them, and in whom they found everything: as Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Moses, Joshua, Shamgar, Samson, Jephthah, Boaz, Samuel, David, Asa, Jehoshaphat, Hezekiah, Josiah, Ezra, Daniel, likewise Sarah, Rachel, Anna Abigail, Ruth, Esther, etc. When you read such, you should say: O God, give me also such faith, that I may also hold you as my God, and you may lead me so graciously. You read in the daughter Esther humility and fear of God; thus she walked upright and blameless before God, therefore God was her God and made her queen. Here learn now also humility and fear of God; God will not leave you either, etc. The prophets Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, etc. teach nothing else than that one should cling firmly to the only God, desire everything from him alone, and walk blamelessly before him. Here they rebuke the vices so raw, as they are: perverting justice and law, oppressing the poor, killing, hating, lying, deceiving, driving pride, whoring, unchastity, adultery, etc. You also find how some like Pharaoh, Saul, Solomon, Jeroboam, Ahab, Joash, likewise Jezebel, Athaliah, and others lived uncleanly and did not hold God alone; therefore they were rejected, destroyed, and condemned with soul and body, along with all their kind, which should frighten you from vices and turn you away from unbelief. For Paul speaks to the Corinthians: "Such things happened to the old ones as examples; it is written for our admonition, that whoever thinks he stands, may well see that he does not fall" [1 Cor 10:11 f]. Abraham had no homeland, likewise Isaac, likewise Jacob, as Paul testifies to the Hebrews in chapter 11 [8ff] and Stephen in Acts chapter 7 [2ff]; he believed God and became rich. The children of Israel did not believe, did not hold him as their God, therefore they remained dead and forty years in the wilderness in haste and vexation.</p>
      <p>In the New Testament, no new covenant is established, but first powerfully shows that God wants to be our God, that is, good and sufficient. Therefore he sent his son, that he may give us life with his death and resurrection. He heals all the sick, gives rest to all those who are restless, that is, he shows with his coming into the world that God wishes well for man and is gracious, and they find everything in him. Therefore when you read in the evangelists that Christ healed all sickness, think: this is the true physician, by whom I find health and not by Saint Damian's nail! When you read that Christ raised the dead, think, now you have found who can give you a better life: only God. When you read how he punished sins, think you, that you abstain from sins. In the writings or epistles of the apostles Peter, Paul, James, John, you will also find the great grace of God and how all perfection is in him, in us nothing but sin, which Christ has blotted out with his blood and commanded us to begin a new life. - In summary, you will find everything that serves to preserve your soul; nothing more than that you always practice with God and begin usefully, therefore you have not asked for God's word before. When you go alone with your own opinion and your own wisdom for advice, the flesh fights according to the flesh.</p>
      <p>When your soul is thus well arranged with God and governed by God's word, then everything that the outer man deals with will be well formed. Here you will now avoid everything that is harmful to virtues, and accept everything that plants a virtuous nature. It is useful, however, that more unchastity and vices are born than idleness. From idleness spring evil thoughts, then (hereupon) excessive chatter, then bad company, then dissolute minds, upon which no shoes, secret conversations, love, and shipwreck of all discipline, honor, and shame.</p>
      <p>Therefore, to avoid all this, shun idleness and always work something, so that and you (as Jerome commands) the devil is always burdened with something, finds no place. Female work is spinning, sewing, weaving, working, embroidering, writing, and reading at times. One must engage in work, and even if one is so rich that one does not need it, one should always work. There have also been pagans who were wealthy, and yet did not want to be idle, who stood to promise them. They taught their children to paint, carve, the liberal arts, and the daughters music, astronomy, and such subtle arts, to keep them from idleness and not let evil fantasies take place. Thus the chaste Penelope did nothing but weave, and preserved her king and lord's honor and discipline, could not be won over by 18 young princes and persevered for 20 years. Look at the Proverbs of Solomon in chapter 31 [10ff].</p>
      <p>Excessive or useless chatter is such an enticing great evil that no one can express it, especially before young tender hearts; it is nothing that harms female discipline more. Therefore such is rightly to be avoided. Such are the fables, tales of love, of other such foolishness and excess, likewise the lover's songs, the fool's books of Sir Tristram [!], of Gismunda of Euryalus and Lucretia, of Leander and the like. One must guard against them as against the Sirens, not buy such things, not read them, not let them be read.</p>
      <p>It is also the noblest and highest female discipline: silence and, if some unchaste speech by woman or man occurs, not to notice it, not to laugh or praise it, otherwise the boor or the coarse-hearted thinks he has done well and made a good joke. Silence should also not be muteness, but a measure of female chatter or talking. Where one is asked decently and cheerfully, one should answer with a smiling mouth and be of lovely and gracious decent speech, yet that it has a measure and other people may also come to speak. The gestures and appearance of the eyes, the mouth, yes the whole body should also be decent, cheerful, and not shameless; everything should be considered beforehand and not hasty, for nothing reveals a woman better than speech, eyes, and body gestures, where otherwise wise people are. Thus laughter should also have a measure and discipline, yet all will be well-formed where discipline, honor, and shame are in the heart, which govern and accomplish all things. Where they are not, certainly nothing but unchastity in all doing and leaving, or but complete hypocrisy, under which peeks out wickedness. Then instruction helps just as much as when one says to an unbeliever: call upon God and call upon him thus, - and he has no God in his heart.</p>
      <p>Company is also one of the greatest deceptions, for it is indescribable what evil games lead to, yes, what one never suspected, it becomes dissolute and speaks of unsuspected things. Therefore you may well look around, to whom you attach yourself. Investigate beforehand one's mind, doing and leaving: who loves truth and is not light, who loves honor and hates evil, who is decent and well-spoken with words, gestures, deeds, friendly, God-fearing, serviceable, and humble, to them you should attach yourself. You should esteem them, honor them, serve them, have your secrets in common with them; yet if you want no one to know, tell no one, not even yourself, and even if you have already experienced that your companions are silent. Still, it is said: "What comes out of the third mouth, that does not remain silent." Trust no one too quickly, investigate all things beforehand and then trust, so you will be improved by good; for with and by evil one is corrupted [!]. So far you have had a decent honorable companion in Justitia, see to it that you always meet it, and know that too much company is also not good.</p>
      <p>Do not trust yourself too much either; there is nothing simpler that is sooner deceived and convicted than a woman. Therefore everything that is introduced and associated with youth should be suspicious to you, also the company and too much friendship of young boys. Youth is thoughtless, and one does not find many who can consider that they have no honor when they have deceived such a simple creature. Let the female sex not enjoy their simplicity either, but are now inclined to deceive much. They set all their thoughts on it and use all deceit with sweet smooth words, high promises; therefore one must guard well here.</p>
      <p>Thus it should not be the least concern of a Christian daughter that she is domestic and economical. And by domesticity, we do not mean being stingy, but taking proper care of the things she is set to manage by her parents, or if she keeps house for herself, not to waste useful things on useless ones, not to neglect useful things, not to let them spoil. This care should not be unrest, but it will be great enough if it is based on the following points. First, you must instill in yourself how necessary it is to have a livelihood, and to have enough to help another, a virtue. Therefore you should arrange yourself so that you do not become needy. So now you must secondly consider what you have as income, and ensure that your expenses do not become greater than the income. So you will live by the rule that says: "You must stretch yourself according to what you know to cover yourself." Likewise: "You must not consider what you would like to have, but what you cannot do without." Thus all unnecessary things will become distasteful to you and you will not spend or give out anything unless it is necessary. Thirdly, you must also keep an eye on a penny and not consider anything so useless that it might not be used somewhere. That will then drive away the good. Fourthly, see exactly what has benefited or harmed other people and you; then follow that or guard against it. Fifthly, you must always be in good account with yourself and others, like to pay, not to overcharge, but even more not to borrow, as far as it may be. Sixthly, you must not entrust anything to others that you can well arrange yourself, and if you do entrust something to them, you should always look after it, etc. When you look at this, you will become truly domestic and certainly not let anything go to waste, yet reserve that you do not let yourself regret what belongs to honor and necessity; for if not, it would be complete stinginess and waste, yes, a real miserly lampwork. A sensible mind sees well what serves honor and how much one should give there and hold back elsewhere. Where there is no reason, it is said: "Fools should not have money." Where there is stinginess, it goes no differently than when one has a sweet harp and does not dare to amuse oneself with it, letting it spoil in the chest.</p>
      <p>Economy is not the least gift of truly capable daughters. It lies in a splendid cheerful mind. When we see how the melancholic Grädy village bumpkins are unorderly and quite unlike the pigs. But where there is a cheerful noble mind, it cannot tolerate disorder and sees exactly that all things happen with order and at their time. These two things are the highest in economy. Such daughters place all their things in their places, like the little piles, not letting one lie here, the other there. Such cannot tolerate any waste, any uncleanliness, everything must shine for them; they have divided the hours in which they do everything, and let no time pass without fruit. Lazy, drowsy, double dreaming and sleeping more than they live. But they are quick, do everything with joy and with half the work, are also quick, if one needed them, to reach and lead with a covered wagon, wherever one wanted them.</p>
      <p>In eating and drinking, there is also not little, for overfilling and nibbling is a great vice and especially causes great harm to female discipline. Where there are drunken women, they are already sold (given up, lost). A decent daughter should eat and drink enough for necessity, not that she becomes more inflamed. For one does not need to put gunpowder in the straw, when it is already near the fire, it will come to the powder without that. A pious daughter should also guard against strange wines, against foreign delicacies; for they empty the purse, accustom the stomach and throat badly, that it will want more afterwards, God grant where it takes it. From this then springs all disorder, shame, and vice.</p>
      <p>As for clothing, nothing adorns a woman's image better than simple, honorable, customary clothes. But so patched, crushed, cut, slashed, and fashionable come in French, Italian, Dutch, Spanish belongs in the ditch. When they are not for sale, what do they need the slashing for, why do they not come like other pious people? Velvet, damask, crimson silk, scarlet, camlet fits better in India, Milan, and Hispalen, suits the merchant in the shop better than a pious daughter before wise believing people. If the outer things must adorn and make saleable, it goes to the good girls at night, when they undress, like the crow in Aesop; she also adorned herself with foreign feathers and wanted to be like the peacock, but when each bird took back its feathers, the poor crow stood there and was nothing but a poor black crow. Whoever is God-fearing, honorable, and decent is truly beautiful, can also act beautifully. Whoever is not, is a wooden block, and even if she were in the middle of a silk bale. Look at Paul 1 Timothy 2 [2ff] and Peter 1 Peter 3 [1ff].</p>
      <p>But when the daughter comes of age, that she feels whether she can master her temptations or not, then she may give herself to maidenhood or to marriage. If she has such a pure heart that she does not care at all for worldly things and has little, yes, no unrest, then she has the gift of maidenhood, yet she should guard well against all things as mentioned above and "if she stands, see that she does not fall" [1 Cor 10:12], not become proud and serve God rightly. But if God has not given her such a heart as mentioned above, she should, to prevent all shame and disgrace of the devil, her flesh, and the world, marry; yet here have the highest and most diligent care that she marries in such a way that she does not harm her soul and body. And above all, one should inquire about piety, fear of God, honor, discipline, care, whether the boy is peaceful and gentle, whether he is a tyrant, a gambler, a drunkard, a whoremonger, a brawler, whether he is wasteful or can be economical, whether he seeks company with good pious people, how he has behaved before, what his nature and occupation are, whether he is also friendly and reasonable. For marriage has enough trouble and anxiety, a pious daughter does not need first to have, that she has an unreasonable hostile dog in the house, from which she is rudely barked at and has neither comfort, joy, nor love, yes, who does not know what belongs to a pious woman, yes, also thinks he is here by himself, and therefore the poor woman should be confused and have nothing for herself.</p>
      <p>But those who have received the gift of maidenhood, the high gift from God, do not need these concerns. Therefore I will now briefly discuss the opinion of Paul 1 Corinthians 7 about maidenhood. He writes thus:</p>
      <p>"Concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord; yet I give my judgment, as one who has obtained mercy from the Lord, to be faithful" [1 Cor 7:25].</p>
      <p>Paul says, Christ Jesus has not commanded anything about maidenhood, for nothing is found about it in the evangelists, except in the Gospel of Matthew chapter 19 [11ff] he says that not everyone is capable of it. Also among the patriarchs, prophets, and saints of the Old Testament, it is not particularly praised, yes, the daughter of Jephthah bewails her maidenhood, for it was not praiseworthy to die without children and outside of marriage without fruit. Therefore Saint Jerome would have been a little more modest in his writing, in which he now grants too much to maidenhood; to which the unclean monks and foolish wreath makers have followed, have done much foolishness and made much virtuous youth to nothing. The holy Paul goes straight there, leaves the commanding and urging, wants to give a friendly advice.</p>
      <p>"I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress, that it is good for a man to remain as he is" [1 Cor 7:26].</p>
      <p>Paul calls good here fitting, appropriate, as in the First Book of Moses chapter 2: "It is not good that the man should be alone; we will make him a helper or companion" [Gen 2:18]. Here "it is not good" means: it is not fitting, should not be. I show this so that one does not want to attribute good works to maidenhood out of misunderstanding the word "good," which is not the mind of Saint Paul. He says that maidenhood is only fitting because it relieves man of many troubles and anxieties that he would have to endure in marriage. Thus it is not for the sake of the spirit, faith, or steadfastness that maidenhood is better than marriage, but only for the sake of our rest; for virgins do not have to bear children, nurse, be economical, have care, keep house, endure contempt from the husband, mourn much, perhaps be beaten, etc. If one were to look at patience and work or measure these things with merit, then the state of marriage would be holier than the idle peaceful state of virginity.</p>
      <p>"Are you bound to a wife? Do not seek to be loosed. Are you loosed from a wife? Do not seek a wife!" [1 Cor 7:27].</p>
      <p>In Corinth, there were some people, as they are still today, who, as soon as they felt the trouble of marriage and heard that purity relieved all troubles, wanted to slip out one way or another. Paul says: no, if you have taken her, keep her; as if he were to say: what did you think beforehand! "If you are free, then look and remain free" always means: yes, if you have purity. Otherwise, the previous saying applies: "It is better to marry than to burn" [1 Cor 7:9].</p>
      <p>"But if you do marry, you have not sinned; and if a virgin marries, she has not sinned" [1 Cor 7:28].</p>
      <p>Since he has said: "if you are free from a wife, do not seek a wife," from which one might conclude: so marriage is wrong, he answers: no, but it is free for boys and girls and without sin. Therefore it follows that the pope with his monks has misled the people. The monks said: losing virginity is a sin. And Paul says: taking a husband is not a sin. Therefore it should be understood: losing it in marriage; otherwise, it is a great sin, as Paul says to the Hebrews: "Marriage is honorable among all, and the bed undefiled; but fornicators and adulterers God will judge" [Hebr 13:4]. See, and if one had no other scripture against the monastic vows and monkish fables, would they not be strong enough alone?</p>
      <p>"Nevertheless such will have trouble in the flesh, but I spare you" [1 Cor 7:28].</p>
      <p>This is the only reason why virginity has an advantage: here is some trouble, care, and accidents, as mentioned above. Yet all this does not harm the spirit, and man must endure it only in the flesh and from outside.</p>
      <p>"But this I say, brethren, the time is short; so that from now on even those who have wives should be as though they had none, those who weep as though they did not weep, those who rejoice as though they did not rejoice, those who buy as though they did not possess, and those who use this world as not misusing it. For the form of this world is passing away. But I want you to be without care" [1 Cor 7:29 f].</p>
      <p>As he has foretold the married people, they will endure something, so he comforts them here again, so that no one, who perhaps did not have purity, would be frightened away from the state of marriage, and says thus: Although one must endure something, one must still consider that it does not last long, but always some comfort and joy comes in between; although one must not set one's heart on it, not on the wife, not on joy, not on what the world sees, and not take it too much to heart, even if some mourning enters. For all the splendor of the world passes away, we also die, but the souls live. Therefore, says Paul, we must not be discouraged or too anxious in these things.</p>
      <p>"He who is unmarried cares for the things of the Lord, how he may please the Lord; but he who is married cares about the things of the world, how he may please his wife. There is a difference between a wife and a virgin. The unmarried woman cares about the things of the Lord, that she may be holy both in body and in spirit. But she who is married cares about the things of the world, how she may please her husband" [1 Cor 7:32-34].</p>
      <p>Paul says, virginity is also higher than marriage because it gives the heart entirely to God, which in marriage cannot be so well, since we must also lay some of our minds on the worldly. And he shows this with many words, sets both states against each other, and yet the one he shows is the sum: Not because you want to think it is a sin to want to please and seek love for him; for to Titus in chapter 2 [3ff] he speaks to the old mothers or wives, they should teach the young women. Therefore you see again that the degree of virginity is higher than marriage, not particularly surpassing.</p>
      <p>"And this I say for your own profit, not that I may put a leash on you, but for what is proper, and that you may serve the Lord without distraction" [1 Cor 7:35].</p>
      <p>Summa summarum that is the right main article, on which the whole advice of Paul should hinge. Thus he says: I have proposed all this to you, not that I draw you either to marriage or to virginity. It is up to you which you accept, as long as you always act honorably, it suits you well and does not draw you away from the Lord. If you feel in yourself the power of your heart, that you can remain truly pure and your desires do not hinder you, so that you can always think of God and do not take up the world at all, then remain, if it pleases you. But if your desires teach you to think otherwise, they draw you away from God, then guard against time and give yourself to marriage; you have not sinned and have somewhat tempered your desirous mind. That is the mind of Paul and his opinion on virginity.</p>
      <p>Now it would be necessary for me to write about the state of marriage, but since it is a long matter, I do not have time and must now, I will write here a copy of what I wrote a year and a half ago at the request and request to the master of the court at Königsfelden in the 127th [128th] Psalm, just at the time when I answered some women whether one might leave the monastery freely. You may have also read a copy of the same writing sent to Lady Justitia.</p>
      <p>Short interpretation of the 127th Psalm:</p>
      <p>Although the 127th Psalm has no title in which one learns which prophet wrote it, yet the manner and spirit, also all the characteristics of David are there, that I think, King David wrote it.</p>
      <p>The summary of the Psalm is this: the prophet sings the happiness of every God-fearing person, how God does not leave him, but overflows with all good.</p>
      <p>Now the Psalm reads thus: "Blessed is everyone who fears the Lord, who walks in His ways! When you eat the labor of your hands, you shall be happy, and it shall be well with you. Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine in the very heart of your house, your children like olive plants all around your table. Behold, thus shall the man be blessed who fears the Lord. The Lord bless you out of Zion, and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life.</p>
      <p>Yes, may you see your children's children. Peace be upon Israel!"</p>
      <p>Here you must not consider whether you do not find all the words of the Psalm exactly in print standing thus. For as I have endeavored in the Epistle to the Corinthians about virginity to translate it exactly from the Greek, in which language Paul wrote, so I have followed the Hebrew here, for David wrote in Hebrew, and neither Latin nor German. Now we will interpret one verse after the other.</p>
      <p>"Blessed is everyone who fears the Lord, who walks in His ways!" [Ps 128:1].</p>
      <p>This is the sum of the whole Psalm, that the God-fearing person will not be left by God the Lord, but will be well advised. Then in the other verses, he explains with more words how he will be advised by God.</p>
      <p>But what is it to fear the Lord or to walk in His ways? Fear of God is not a painful care and expectation of terror, but a heartfelt loving care that we always please God, and a burning zeal that we do nothing contrary to Him: 1 John 4 [18ff]. Those who bear such care and love for God remain and walk in God's ways: they diligently look at what God commands, and they follow it, not considering what they themselves think is good. The ungodly do not care much if they do not please God, therefore they do not care about God's commands and walk in their ways, doing what they think is good. Example. It is written: "Flee fornication and sanctify your bodies" (1 Corinthians 6 [18]; 1 Thessalonians 4 [3]). The God-fearing hears this, sees God's will, begins at once and goes in this way of God, holds virginity, or marries, regardless of whether there is some tribulation; for he sees that this is the way of God, His command and precept, whatever it may cost. But the ungodly also hears God's command, but does not do it, for he does not walk in God's, but in his ways, and thinks it good to let things go idle and not to load unrest on his neck; so that a good loan is better than a bad own. But as those are blessed by the Lord, so these are plagued with blindness, unchastity, wickedness, shame, vice, and finally with eternal death; therefore it is better for them here to have a short temporal joy and rest, - although even that is not very restful - than eternal blessedness.</p>
      <p>"When you eat the labor of your hands, you shall be happy, and it shall be well with you!" [Ps 128:2].</p>
      <p>The ungodly now presses for great heaps of gained goods, therefore they do not need to bear much need. But the God-fearing has a desire and joy in the good that he himself gains with God (or also inherits with honor), for he knows well that God and fortune are with it. And in the labor of the hands, no other honorable occupation is excluded: not of the feet, not of the mind. For one must not only have the coarse works that happen with hands, like peasant work, handicraft, but also the governing and leading. All this is well seen in Paul, 1 Corinthians 12 [12ff], how many offices there are and that "a laborer is worthy of his wages" [1 Tim 5:18; Lk 10:7]. But it is disgraceful to want to be superior to other people, to live off other people's goods and have no common office, also not to use anything, as has been the case with monasticism and a part of the extravagant nobility, and in our times the Anabaptists.</p>
      <p>Whoever is a true God-fearing person looks to work and diligently provide for his office, to which he is appointed by God and set by people. He has no fear that something will be lacking for him, for the God who is almighty and cannot lie, who says: "It shall be well with you, very well with you" [Ps 128:2], yes, he will let his work prosper, and Matthew 6: "Your Father knows what you need before you ask Him. Or who among you can add one cubit to his stature, and if he worries much? Why do you worry about food or clothing? The morrow will take care of itself. It is enough that each day has its own work and trouble" [Mt 6:8; 27 f; 34]. As if he were to say: you do not need to worry and gnaw much about it, no more than look that you work; God will arrange it well. He himself has also created and ordained marriage in the beginning, of which we are to live. He is the one who sustains and feeds all creatures: Psalm 103 [104] and 137 [138]. Look at the example of the God-fearing Jacob in the First Book of Moses chapters 29, 30, and 31. He had nothing but his own body, neither lying nor moving goods, but he served and worked faithfully, and became exceedingly rich over time. We cannot become landowners within 3 days. Tobias speaks to his son, Tobias chapter 4 [23]: "Do not fear, my son, we must live here in poverty for a while, yet we will have many goods, only if we fear the Lord, guard against sin and do right." Likewise Psalm 33 [Ps 34:9-11]: "Taste and see that the Lord is good. Blessed is the man who trusts in Him! Fear Him, His saints; for those who fear Him have no lack. The rich must suffer want and hunger, but those who seek the Lord lack no good thing." Likewise Psalm 111 [Ps 112:1-3]: "Blessed is the man who fears the Lord, who delights greatly in His commandments! His descendants will be mighty on earth, the generation of the upright will be blessed, wealth and riches will be in his house, and his righteousness endures forever." Likewise Saint Paul to the Hebrews chapter 13 [5f]: "Let your conduct be without covetousness; be content with such things as you have. For He Himself has said, 'I will never leave you nor forsake you' [Dtn 31:6], so that we may boldly say: 'The Lord is my helper; I will not fear. What can man do to me?'" [Ps 118:6].</p>
      <p>These are all strong and firm promises of God. If you believe and are God-fearing, well for you, you have great peace, and it will go well with you! If you do not believe, yet He will not deny Himself to His believers; for heaven and earth must fall together before a letter of God's word would not be true [Mt 5, 18; 24,35]. But you will remain in unrest and hardship, will never be satisfied, will thus suffer the greatest poverty in the midst of your gold. For the wise Solomon says in Proverbs chapter 10 [22]: "The blessing or free gift of the Lord makes rich, without unrest." And in chapter 15 [169]: "Better is a little with the fear of the Lord than great treasure with trouble, and better is a dish with herbs where love is than a fatted ox with hatred" etc. Christ says in Matthew chapter 6 [33]: "Seek first the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added to you." </p>
      <p>There will also be no rhyme here, that you want to think, God will give you, that you must go idle and lie in the mire, or endure all play, defile all tavern walls, watch and riot all night with all frivolity, with dancing, running, whoring, adultery, and drinking. Nothing will come of it. Thus the good is wasted, which young people have in hand and have already gained, thinking it needs no care. There the man breaks the jugs and pots outside, and the woman picks up the shards at home in the meantime. There is then no God, no honor, no discipline, no fruit, no peace, no love, but hatred, devil, poison, gall, beating, scolding, scratching, and shaming. Thereby body, honor, soul, and goods are ruined; it is not a human, but a devilish life. Where it should go right, there must be fear of God, care, and work, - as the prophet here clearly expresses.</p>
      <p>One can also measure from this what the duty of a true God-fearing husband is. That: work, care, provide for the house, arrange everything, not waste useful things on useless ones, then also instruct the wife friendly, how she must do everything; for as one can blame no one but the shepherd when the sheep are disorderly and scabby, so it is the husband's fault when the wife cannot. He is her head, should discipline her. One must look into the game in time and in youth; for when age comes, and one then first sees that one has gone astray, there is no hope of improvement. Then the husband should hold the wife in honor, esteem her as a weak vessel, be helpful to her, hold her dear and worthy, yes, love her no less than himself, have all things in common with her, mourn with her in sickness, comfort her in adversity, thus live lovingly and friendly with her with reason. Thus Saint Peter has taught us 1 Peter 3 [7] and Paul Ephesians chapter 5 [25ff]. This is what the God-fearing do, but the foolish laugh and say: She must serve me, I do not look at her, what else would I want from her foolishness; one must not let her go masterless, seek out the stick and lead her to Knüttlingen etc. Although there are also some bad women who need great care and punishment; but that should happen with reason for improvement. But now follows also about women.</p>
      <p>"Your wife shall be like a fruitful vine in the very heart of your house" [Ps 128:3].</p>
      <p>This is the second blessing of a pious God-fearing man, that God the Lord provides him with a diligent domestic wife, and the prophet compares an honorable economical wife to a fruitful vine, yes, a vine arbor before a house; they are usually more fruitful and beautiful than other vines. So that the prophet's meaning is: God will provide the God-fearing with such a wife, who, like a vine full of grapes, is lovely to look at; so the wife will diligently keep together and gather a good collection.</p>
      <p>We see this now in our times, that briefly the households are not to be, in which there are no skillful capable women. The man may bring in as much as he wants, if the wife is drunken, disorderly, incapable, it is all lost; for it is much greater to keep together and use rightly than to gain. Yet a man who is sensible can bring much to pass, and an obedient compliant wife can accomplish much, so that one follows, helps, accepts punishment from the other. But where each wants his way and no reason, "there one seeks," as it is said, "the cuckoos, and finally finds an empty pot."</p>
      <p>Solomon writes in his Proverbs chapter 31 about capable God-fearing wives thus: "Who can find a virtuous wife? For her worth is far above rubies. The heart of her husband safely trusts her, so he will have no lack of gain. She seeks wool and flax, and willingly works with her hands, and is like the merchant ships, she brings her food from afar. She also rises while it is yet night, and provides food for her household and a portion for her maidservants. She perceives that her merchandise is good, and her lamp does not go out by night. She stretches out her hands to the distaff, and her hand holds the spindle. She extends her hand to the poor, yes, she reaches out her hands to the needy. She opens her mouth with wisdom, and on her tongue is the law of kindness" etc. [Prov 31:10f. 13-15. 18-20.26]. Therefore the same wise man says: "He who finds a wife finds a good thing, and obtains favor from the Lord," Proverbs 18 [22].</p>
      <p>One can also measure from this what the duty of a wife is, namely to hold faith and love for the husband, to be domestic, careful, and economical, not to overwhelm the husband with bad words, to plague, to nag, to be unkind, unreasonable, but to be lovely, cheerful, and heartfelt, to be obedient to the husband in all right and honorable things, for the husband is set by God as the lord, not the wife. Therefore Saint Paul says: "Wives, submit to your own husbands" [Eph 5:22]. Yet the husbands should not forget what follows: "Husbands, love your wives and do not be bitter toward them" [Eph 5:25; Col 3:19]. The wife should also be decent, humble, patient, should raise children if God gives them to her. Read about this 1 Timothy 2 [8ff] and 1 Peter 3 [1ff]. Thus it is the wife's duty to be obedient, pious, domestic, and friendly, to walk in faith, love, and innocence with discipline.</p>
      <p>The tribulation in marriage is also not as severe as one makes it; for if one does right, it is right. Where there are reasonable people, they will not have much compulsion, dispute, or tribulation. But where there is youth, unreason, and little fear of God, no one should think that hell is not there; they suffer and torment each other, and when some tribulation is laid upon them by God, they do not recognize it, are impatient, and have hellish unrest. But where there are believing people, they do to each other what is dear to them. When God lays some tribulation upon them, they recognize it, are patient, help each other bear the burden; whereas among the ungodly each wants the misfortune of the other. So the pious know, even if they are in some tribulation, that it must be so, is thus ordered by God, and they live in God's will. This brings them such comfort that they cannot be overwhelmed with too much suffering.</p>
      <p>"Your children like olive plants all around your table" [Ps 128:3].</p>
      <p>This is the third blessing of a pious God-fearing man: God will give him decent beautiful children. But the olive plant is beautiful to look at, very good to bend and train, also full of fruit. Therefore he compares the children to it, who will be handsome, gentle, good to train, and for whose sake God sometimes sends great wealth to the parents. This is now a great blessing and a blessed thing, yes, a divine, lovely, joyful comfort, to see your own flesh and blood so beautiful and decent, yes, well-behaved before you and friendly to you, also an ornament and praise of the almighty God. The ancients knew this, and therefore held it for unpraiseworthy to be without children. Read in the First Book of Samuel chapter 1 [1ff], how Anna behaved so badly etc. And Christ says: "Let the little children come to me, for of such is the kingdom of God" [Mt 19:14]; and our monks and nuns have held such an abomination against children, yet they are not worthy to take the child of the most despised swineherd in their arms. It is a noble treasure, a gift of God, with which great happiness and salvation is.</p>
      <p>It is also included here the raising of children, of which I have written a special book, and it would be too long to teach exactly here. In summary, the highest lies in this and therefore one must give an account to God. One must use wisdom well here and be serious, to lead them to the knowledge of God, in whose power, comfort, and testament they are baptized, that they become decent, capable, pious God-fearing people. And that will also be the best inheritance you can leave them behind: teach them early also to earn, that they earn for themselves and more from themselves than from you living, so they will become serious, capable, noble people. But if you raise them in pleasure, they are soft-hearted, you are of no use to them and teach them nothing, then leave them already great wealth, it is of no use; they are rascals and remain rascals, are without foundation, ruin whole kingdoms, you experience neither honor nor discipline from them. From such people David desires to be delivered and says in the 16th Psalm [Ps 17:14]: "Lord, deliver me from the people of this life, who have their reward in their life, whom you fill the belly, who have many friends and children, and leave the rest to the heirs" etc. If you then already have great wealth, yet teach them to do right and work, so that they become rich people after your departure, as Paul speaks of the rich 1 Timothy chapter 6 [6ff].</p>
      <p>If you then die from your young children, yet God still lives. He is your God, he will also be the God of the children, and so much more, so much more they need help. In short, a true God-fearing person trusts firmly in the living God and knows that it is clearly written: "I have been young and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken, nor his descendants begging bread" [Ps 37:25]. The godless greedy do not trust God, always use foresight, and yet have more poverty and their children in haste than the God-fearing. For thus God punishes unbelief.</p>
      <p>"Behold, thus shall the man be blessed who fears the Lord" [Ps 128:4].</p>
      <p>For the second time he says it now, that one may know that it is certain, yes, that God will bless the God-fearing thus and never leave them. Yes, note exactly: not every hypocrite, clapper will he bless, but the God-fearing. This is now promised to all believers by the true God, therefore no one should doubt. Examples are: Abraham, who had to leave his homeland and had nothing, also did not know where to go, and yet had a wife and a large household, but was made rich by the Lord. Jacob crossed the Jordan, had nothing but a staff, but was God-fearing, and came back after twenty years with wife, children, servants, and unspeakable wealth. Joseph was led captive to Egypt, and in a short time became the chief head. David was a poor shepherd, but was God-fearing, and became king in Israel. - This is written for our example and model. In our times we have seen rich people perish in a moment, because they were unjust, whereas poor people, yet God-fearing, came into wealth. Thus God arranges it, and fulfills his word.</p>
      <p>"The Lord bless you out of Zion, and may you see the good of Jerusalem all the days of your life" [Ps 128:5].</p>
      <p>For the third time he promises now and adds: "The Lord from Zion," names the man who will do such things. As if he were to say: Here no one should have any doubt; what God promises, he keeps. He is the Lord and God from Zion, who is the creator and lord of all things, can do everything, who has worked so wonderfully incredible works with Jerusalem. Therefore he can easily accomplish it; what he promises, he will certainly do, as surely and truly as he is in Zion etc. But what is "seeing the good of Jerusalem"? Jerusalem was the most famous, glorious, richest city on earth, so that those who see Jerusalem in good, are blessed, protected, and led with unspeakable faithfulness and care, like Jerusalem. To this he adds: "all the days of your life." Therefore we should not fear either old age or sickness. If we are God-fearing, God will not leave us all our life long; and that is certain.</p>
      <p>"Yes, may you see your children's children. Peace be upon Israel!" [Ps 128:6].</p>
      <p>The God-fearing already have some tribulation, see, yet they are not without great honor and joy. They will be well pleased with their children in God and honor, are at peace and in peace, rejoice in God, live long, are very happy. But the ungodly wither away, have never love, nor true joy, experience shame, vice, and suffering in their children. For our God is a true God: whoever does not trust in him, already perishes; but whoever trusts in him, will never be put to shame, for he is the only perfect unbetrayed good in Jesus Christ our Lord. To him be praise forever.</p>
      <p>This is the instruction on female discipline and how a pious daughter should conduct her walk and being. If you follow this, I am of good hope, you will have honor before God and the world and maintain your female discipline beautifully. I have written it all in haste within a day and a half in great unrest. Therefore I ask that you consider all things well, for what it is, it is written for your good use and honor willingly and with great favor.</p>
      <p>May the grace of God be with you.</p>
