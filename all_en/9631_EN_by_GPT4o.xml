      <p>Greetings. Since, most honorable man, venerable elder, you have often and almost in all your letters addressed to Johann Baptist Müller included many greetings to me, I have great reason to give thanks to your kindness and excellence. For from this, I can easily gather that you not only remember me but are also very fond of me, and because, just as I am dear to you, so in return your kindness is dear to me from the bottom of my heart, I certainly do not willingly cause you troubles and labors.</p>
      <p>However, since I have been asked these days by someone to write to you on his behalf, I could not refrain from this duty, although I reluctantly trouble you. The reason is that I love the one for whom I write and pray, that you may have him recommended to you and help him, if possible, so that he may have his daily bread among you. For he is a Jew, but baptized and believing in Jesus Christ, whom he confesses not only with his mouth but also with many good works, which scarcely anyone born of Christian parents would do. His name is known to the Lord; he is called Marcus Lombardus. I wish the man all good things. He has so humbled himself among us that he finally wanted to become the overseer of the beggars, so that he might eat his bread for free, but do something; however, he could not have the position. A Jew and a Hebrew and skilled in several languages, he ought to be received for the sake of Jesus Christ, whom he acknowledges as his savior. For salvation is from the Jews, and the Jews have sown spiritual things for us.</p>
      <p>And even if he is perhaps still weak in faith, we, nevertheless, as the apostle advises, ought to bear the infirmities of the weak, as he is by birth from the tribe of Benjamin, just as the Lord knows all these things better than I do. Therefore, I again and again ask the Lord to be with him both in counsel and in help, so that he may remain truly Christian among true Christians and have his sustenance. For just as wealth gives many the occasion to sin against God, so also poverty sometimes provides the opportunity to take the name of the Lord God in vain. Finally, I ask your kindness to forgive me, that almost always in my letters I only beg and ask something from you. May our Lord also grant you all the desires of your heart through Christ Jesus. Amen.</p>
      <p>Farewell, most honorable man, and always pray for me and continue to love me, as you do.</p>
      <p>Please greet on my behalf the much esteemed Mr. Rudolf Gwalther, Mr. Haller, and the other beloved brothers in the Lord.</p>
      <p>Basel, in the year of our Lord 1574, April 6. Johannes Brandmüller.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man in piety, prudence, learning, and authority, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger the elder, an outstanding servant of Christ, most esteemed lord and father.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
      <p>From Mr. Brandmüller of Basel on behalf of Marcus Lombardus.</p>
