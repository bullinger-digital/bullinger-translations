      <p>Finally, the messenger returned on the sixth day after your letter had been delivered to me. The people of Schaffhausen respond piously and cordially, the people of Basel sparingly. For they offer almost no advice. They only send their edicts, yet without any prejudice. Our brother Sulzer diligently excuses that he could not obtain more. How earnestly you have endeavored to help us, most upright and esteemed brother, I perceive in many ways.</p>
      <p>Nor do I doubt that our Mr. Gwalther has also played his part. Whatever may happen, for your singular faith and outstanding zeal, I acknowledge that I owe you more than I can repay. But the Lord, to whom you have devoted this effort, will repay abundantly. Certainly, I will not lack mutual goodwill towards you. Nothing has yet been done in the council, because the letters are still with the interpreter. Since we are dealing with the most wicked slanderers, they will stir up various quarrels for us.</p>
      <p>However, I hope for either victory or a tolerable outcome. As soon as something is concluded, I will make sure you know. For the joy will be mutual if it succeeds according to our wish.</p>
      <p>A booklet against Servetus will be published at this Frankfurt fair, in which I have briefly included the argument that you wished me to address. Regarding those who oppose, I had privately complained to you, meanwhile, I had decided to spare their names, as I did, so that the disgrace of a few men would not be cast upon the whole church. And certainly, they are worthy to be overwhelmed by eternal darkness. What had not previously come to my mind, the progress of the cause itself taught me, that your letter about Servetus should be included in the book, which I allowed myself to do, relying on your kindness. If my decision does not please you, I will strive to amend it. Farewell, most excellent man and distinguished minister of Christ and fellow soldier to be respected by me. May the Lord continue to guide you with the spirit of wisdom and strength and protect your church. Diligently greet your colleagues and family in my name. My colleagues, Mr. Celsus Martinengo, Mr. Budaeus, and other brothers, respectfully greet you. Geneva, the day before the calends of January 1554.</p>
      <p>Johannes Calvin, truly yours.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man and exceptional minister of Christ, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, pastor of the church of ZÃ¼rich, brother and fellow soldier to be respected.</p>
