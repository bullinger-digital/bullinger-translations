      <p>C[aelius] S[ecundus] C[urio] through Christ Jesus our Lord sends greetings.</p>
      <p>Unless I knew you, dearest Bullinger and most loving brother in Christ, to be of such constancy that, once you have begun to love and cherish someone, you are not easily or for a small matter, nor even for a great one, turned away from your love and zeal for them, I would somewhat doubt your goodwill towards me. For during these past six or eight months, although you have frequently written here to all your friends and continue to do so, you have passed me by alone.</p>
      <p>But far be it from me to think such things; rather, I attribute it to your most serious occupations (as I also indicated in my last letters to you), especially since nothing has proceeded from me that (as far as I know) would have violated or harmed our friendship and trust even in the slightest. Therefore, lest our friendship, dearest Bullinger, lie idle, I address you with these letters as well, but not without cause, as I will explain to you briefly.</p>
      <p>I hear that you wrote to our Balthasar Alter about having received some information regarding his two wives. I know you are not the kind of man who easily believes informers; therefore, you preferred to write to him rather than others about this matter, so that if it were true, you might rebuke him, not defame him among others. In this matter, I greatly praise your prudence and modesty. I will tell you what I know best about this matter and will hide nothing from you; for I have known Balthasar for 12 years now, and he stayed with me for some time when I was in Venice. He indeed had a wife then, a most corrupt woman infamous for her daily infidelities. When he caught her in adultery, he left her for a time; then, hoping he could win her over to Christ, he reconciled with her.</p>
      <p>But when he and many others saw her becoming worse by the day, he was forced to completely abandon her and send her a notice of divorce, and on the advice of the best brothers, he married another wife, with whom he now lives most honorably. The brothers who were in the churches of the Venetian empire at that time know this to be the case. From this, you can understand, with your wisdom, whether Balthasar is to be blamed for this action or rather those detestable ones who, out of malice and a desire to slander, have criminally reported a good and holy man to you.</p>
      <p>And also, so that you may have another most religious witness with me, I have the letters of Count Julius Thieneus of Vicenza, whose name and singular piety I have no doubt you have heard from many. You will receive more about this matter from him than from me, as he was there continuously, while the Lord has led me to various lands. Farewell, my best and most loving brother, and consider what I write to you for the sake of defending the truth (for I am most devoted to it) with fairness and goodwill, and love me, I say, love me; for I also love and cherish you and hold you in my heart and do not let go. My family sends heartfelt greetings to yours. Farewell again through Christ Jesus.</p>
      <p>Basel, 16th day before the Kalends of April, 1550.</p>
      <p>I ask you this one thing, since I know that our Balthasar is greatly afflicted by this false rumor and fabricated crime, that you would deign to console him with your letters, as you love me and the truth.</p>
      <p>Caelius, as always, yours from the heart and with the best faith. These two young men are returning from you, as I hear, having been summoned, one of whom is a master of arts, the other a student; both have always seemed to me to be upright. They also wish to be commended to you by me. I therefore ask your kindness to have them commended to you, as their piety and integrity deserve. Farewell again and pray to God for us.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious and best man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, most learned and vigilant pastor and bishop of the Church of Zürich, most esteemed lord and brother.</p>
      <p>In Zürich.</p>
