      <p>S. These two young men greeted me, asking if I wanted to write anything; I promised, I write, but what? The time was short; therefore, briefly hear what I want you to know. The Prussian prince has died; thus perhaps Osiander will cease from his madness, unless he finds another prince equally, as he was, misled, although he has not acted entirely imprudently so far.</p>
      <p>About the people of Strasbourg, you will be sufficiently informed. They perhaps did not care much about the fact that the Schwenckfeldians are multiplying more than is proper in Strasbourg. Nobles are joining, so that, if you also wish to be adorned with nobility, you can achieve it if you become a Schwenckfeldian. The Anabaptists similarly raise their heads only in hatred of the true ministry. They seem to me to be Epicureans, they are so proud; they differ nothing from the new monasticism, they boast so much about their integrity; they have no one to resist them. Dr. Hedio is suffering from nettle rash, Battus from kidney stones, Lenglius from quartan fever, Dr. Marbach is still absent with Christoph Trident; few remain who apply proper effort. The Senate, due to the warlike tumults, is hardly at ease. So much for the people of Strasbourg.</p>
      <p>About the Swabian war, you can know everything better than I; only rumors come here. More certain things are reported from Lower Germany. Maurice is said to be on his way to the Swabians, they also announce that the city of Metz has been occupied by Montb√©liard. The Frenchman is advancing through Kaiserslautern towards Speyer.</p>
      <p>Caelius says that Mirandola is holding firm, yet lacking wine and wood; they are employing stratagems like those the Magdeburgers used. Very recently, with enough cunning, they destroyed the rampart which the enemy had built near the city walls, and they drove the enemy away. Tomorrow will be the seventh day since the Italian nobles reported these things, coming directly from Italy.</p>
      <p>A rumor had come here that the council had been dissolved; however, Marbach wrote to his wife on March 16th that he had come to Trento with his people, thinking there would be a session the next day, but that it was postponed to the 1st of May. Philipp, called by his prince, is traveling through Nuremberg to Saxony.</p>
      <p>A strange rumor flies that the Bishop of Arras has somewhat inclined towards the French, seized by the Emperor and beheaded.</p>
      <p>By killing, he will eventually kill himself. Farewell with yours in Christ. I would order Otto to be greeted, if he were not now acting more happily; you announced a mournful message. Basel, April 18, 1552.</p>
      <p>Your Oswald Myconius.</p>
      <p>To Dr. Bullinger, his reverend in Christ.</p>
      <p>Zurich.</p>
