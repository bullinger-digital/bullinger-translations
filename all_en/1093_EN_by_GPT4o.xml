      <p> Greetings. I have written to you four times now, if I am not mistaken, most learned man, and have not received any response from you, which makes me wonder greatly what the reason might be. For I am not aware of having offended you in any way; I suspect that some ill-wisher has spread coldness between us. But I implore you for Christ's sake, do not reject and condemn me without stating the cause; tell me whatever it is that has offended you; unless I clear myself and satisfy you, then do with me as you please. I loved you for your most eloquent and learned writings before I knew you by face, and I will not cease to love you, even if you cast me aside, which I hope you will not do. Until now, I have never been able to satisfy our senate in regard to the Interim; therefore, I was forced to request and have obtained a release, albeit under unfavorable conditions, which I prefer to endure rather than be blamed if anything happens to the city today or tomorrow due to the Interim not being sufficiently defended and maintained. </p>
      <p> Now I am uncertain where to turn. Fugger has promised a stipend if I devote myself to civil law for three years. But I would prefer anything to being involved in secular matters. </p>
      <p> Help me, I pray, both with advice and action, so that a place and position may be found for me somewhere; this favor of yours will never be forgotten by me. Farewell and write back even with just three words. Given on November 30, 1550. </p>
      <p> Your Thomas Naogeorgus. </p>
      <p> To the most learned and honorable Mr. Heinrich Bullinger in Zürich, my special gracious lord and friend. </p>
      <p> Zürich. </p>
