    <p xml:id="regest1">Thanks for the gifts sent to him. He is concerned because there are rumors that Bullinger approves of Ambrosius Blarer's WÃ¼rttemberg Concord on the Lord's Supper and even wants to preach something similar. Karlstadt, of course, does not believe this, but still asks for a brief written explanation so that he can better defend Bullinger against such accusations. Therefore, he also requests the sending of Bullinger's "Assertio utriusque in Christo naturae". Greetings.</p>

      <p>Greetings. I thank you, most prudent Bullinger. For I have received the most delightful gifts you sent. However, there is a rumor that you approve of what Mr. Blarer did due to infirmity, or rather what he did to allow himself to announce Christ to the infirm, in such a way that many fear you will publish something similar in public sermons. I do not believe this at all. For I know your learning and constancy. Therefore, it would be in your interest to send me a note on this matter, so that I may silence the mouths of those who suspect you of introducing the milk of infirmity to those already strong and edified in the Lord. Thus, with such gentleness, I have been pleased to narrate what they somewhat harshly chatter about. If you consider what I say as a wound, know that it comes from charity and that I seek nothing else but to defend the honor of one who has deserved well of me with a certain reason. Therefore, send the Assertion as soon as possible, since I always strive with all my might to preserve your honor and reputation and that of all the people of Zurich.</p>
      <p>Farewell happily. Greet the lords and patrons lovingly.</p>
      <p>Basel, September 27, 1534.</p>
      <p>Yours, Karlstadt.</p>
      <p>To the most learned man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, Zurich Antistes, most esteemed patron and brother.</p>
