      <p>Your reverence, reverend father, everything has been returned to me, and indeed the latest things have arrived in good time; but by then, however, many had already left the assembly. Yet a good part is still present, and this is the sum of the response; our people are greatly surprised that the Prince of Condé neither writes nor acts, and if I had received the letter half a day earlier, I believe Captain Härtli, the commander, would have been sent himself to the Lord of Schärteres. With him, Lord Härtli and Lord Georg Carlyn, I have shared and held in common all matters concerning your writings and this negotiation. These two gentlemen have asked me (they are both astute men) to write to your reverence, that you would do well and, if the Lord of Schärteres is still present or someone else in the name of Condé, to inform them that Captain Härtli, in the name of some prominent members of the League, is ready to speak with him personally. If it pleases the representatives of Condé, that they write quickly, the letters to me; I shall then send a special messenger immediately. I see that the matter is important to the man, as well as to Lord Carlin, and they are distressed that they are not consulted about it (all these men are influential in the League, they should not be neglected or alienated). Lord Härtli has said, although he is old and no longer willing to pursue wars, he would like to do something for Christ and his church at last. The same with Georgius; I see them both fully inflamed; therefore, if necessary, they can provide soldiers.</p>
      <p>Therefore, I ask you to write these things to the Condéans as soon as possible. Furthermore, since our people are about to send a delegation to France, I would very much like the matter to be communicated with our people, so they do not feel disregarded. The evangelical hand in the League, when it comes to a sea, extends far; but it would be good if Captain Härtli could speak personally with the Lord of Schärteres or other representatives about all matters, etc. So much for this.</p>
      <p>Oh, how the people were stirred (that is, these two very experienced soldiers), when they heard that the prince delayed the matter for so long; they say they predicted the fate of the Germans last year. They also say that the Duke of Guise acts as if he wants to let it come to a settlement, but goes about strengthening himself in the meantime. One knows well from the past.</p>
      <p>Why do our people yield so much? If only Hercules would speak with the Condéan delegates. But if I make it long, God is the master and it remains as it pleases.</p>
      <p>However, as soon as you can, inform me what you have accomplished, and as I said, be the author that your people write to ours. We must work together, as we see that the devil's crowd is also gathering. Our bishop appeared before the Three Leagues, announced how he was called to the council, and asked for their advice (I have not yet met with the councilors, as I understand, with what words he proposed; I will know soon); it was rejected and failed. On Sunday, in the largest gathering of people, even papists, I explained the reasons why the Council of Trent should be avoided by Christians; you will understand the summary from the Latin sermon, which I will send soon; for I have not yet been able to take the time to write it down. The one who rode through here from Trent was sent by Melchior Lussi, immediately in the inn he inquired about the commander, that is, Hercules a Salicibus, who did not respond as needed; for Melchior Lussi had sent him a greeting. Our man, seeing the other earnestly commend and praise his Lussi to the heavens, even for the reason that he had great authority with the pope and that he could speak better with the holy father than anyone else, that the holy father said to him, Lussi, if you had no wife and not a penny, I would make you a lord (promised a bishopric); Lussi replied, most holy father, and if I were such a lord, I would rather have my wife and be a beggar, I do not strive for that. - This, I say, he proclaimed, Hercules pretending to commend Lussi's virtues and prudence likewise, to explore more; but the cunning other did not want to break out.</p>
      <p>But when Hercules was asked why the one from Peschgär had ridden away and if the fathers were of one mind, he noticed so much about the companion that they were not of one mind and the matter was drawn out, and as he thought, the session would be extended into August, etc. In the meantime, without a doubt, he is sent here to his people, that is, the Five Pagans, to communicate plans among themselves. In Schwytz, they met last Sunday, and when one from Schwytz noticed this here, he said they were completely divided in Schwytz, and he could not believe that the community would dissolve without a fight; the old majority is against the move. Now I come to my own matters.</p>
      <p>I send you these letters and indeed to you alone, so you see with whom I have to deal. When I say alone, I do not exclude Dr. Gwalther and Dr. Wolphius and even Dr. Martyr, but I want these things to be kept secret. You read everything.</p>
      <p>Vergerius, who spread that book in Clavenna and has it here in his hands, will nevertheless hand it over to me; for I have pressed the man with these conditions, so that he cannot do otherwise; for I said, unless he does it, I will complain to the senate about the injury, that he spreads a book written as an insult to me and the church of Zurich.</p>
      <p>He promised to do it.</p>
      <p>Dr. colleague had indeed read that book, but still concealed the matter from me, however, he wrote to Michael Angelus not to spread such a book (undoubtedly, because he was striving for concord). But when the case of Peter Leon was being discussed in the synod, I kept myself within the bounds of modesty for a long time and as long as I saw Vergerius sometimes with entreaties, sometimes with complaints, etc., able to persuade the brothers to his opinion, whose arts and those of Peter Leon and Vergerius were unknown, I openly and indeed sharply opposed, nor could I do otherwise; for I saw a good cause deserted by advocacy. And when among other things I said: two points of deliberation, first, whether Peter Leon had satisfied us so that he should be received into grace, secondly, whether, if Peter Leon had satisfied us, he should therefore be imposed on the church... someone who had rashly disturbed it, and on these two points opinions should be asked; when I was ordered by Dr. Philipp to give my opinion, I explained at length that Peter Leon had not yet satisfied, as it seemed to Vergerius; for so far he had played with the tricks of words; it seemed to me that the book of Peter Leon was very pestilent and therefore he was excommunicated; therefore he should be asked in clear words whether he admits this book is a bad book and one in which he sinned against charity by writing and printing it and undermined the articles of faith, and whether he admitted he was rightly and deservedly excommunicated for that reason. That opinion prevailed.</p>
      <p>When he was asked, he turned himself in all directions for a long time; finally, when Vergerius answered many things for him, I said I would understand the whole matter from Peter Leon. Peter Leon finally burst out with these words: "The book is good and Christian, and everything in it is Christian." When I noted these words with chalk, Vergerius was very upset, and when I repeated from the writing, Vergerius intervened and said the words should not be examined so exactly and admitted that this book is a good book. When I said: "Vergerius, this book is very pestilent," he asked, who am I to judge, who have not read it. I then asked in return, whether he says the book was condemned by the brothers, who have not read it; there are good men present in the synod, who have all read it, and translated the points of controversy for me into Latin; whether he wants to know them. Then Philippus Gallicius testified that he had read the book and it is a bad book (there Philippus agreed with me, but let me hang the bells on the cat). When Vergerius said he knew what had been done in the previous synod, but nevertheless Leon was condemned in absentia, I replied that the book spoke for Peter Leon and there were more than I would like, who advocated his cause; but I was surprised why Vergerius himself condemned the acts of the previous synod so rashly, about which there is no certainty. He exclaimed loudly: "Do not accuse of rashness;" I said I stand by my opinion and add that this booklet of Peter Leon is a heretical book. There he: "Then I am also a heretic?" I: "What you are, you see yourself.</p>
      <p>The book is heretical; for Peter Leon admits he did not want to subscribe to Augustine, who condemned these articles, which are nevertheless condemnable." Then he said he would handle this case and not allow force, so that he would be accused. I said it is bad, etc., and so, when the hour of lunch approached, we departed.</p>
      <p>After lunch, we met again.</p>
      <p>In the meantime, he... seemed to have softened.</p>
      <p>But when after lunch I was ordered to give my opinion, I testified that I did not know what to say, since Michael Angelus also perverted the acts of the previous synod and since there is nothing safe, what is done with these people. However, I did not want to proceed unless Peter Leon admitted he was rightly excommunicated.</p>
      <p>All the brothers are of my opinion.</p>
      <p>There you would have seen and heard amazing things, into what forms they turned themselves.</p>
      <p>Finally, we dictated the formula you read. When Vergerius saw himself deserted, he advised Peter Leon to agree.</p>
      <p>He went out with him, persuaded him separately, returned, promised to do everything. The next day Vergerius sent a written document in Peter Leon's handwriting, which was adulterated; he had changed many words. Then all the brothers saw that I had predicted the truth; for I had said, unless he writes it in his own hand, not three days will pass, he will deny everything, and we will all have to lie, etc. He will call us all liars, and it must be true.</p>
      <p>For the firmness of faith, he had opposed "weakness of faith" and added some other things in each article. But in vain; we sent for him.</p>
      <p>He turned himself in all directions; he says it is the same opinion, asks by God that we not be so rigid.</p>
      <p>I asked: "If it is the same opinion, why do you change the words? You seem not to act candidly." Finally, after much, when others urged, he wrote the entire formula. Otherwise, we allow the church of Clavenna and do not force it, which knows the man. So you see he did not seriously repent and is a bad man who disturbs the church.</p>
      <p>The next day Vergerius came to Dr. Philipp, asked that if he wrote to the church of Clavenna, he would mitigate and not add the revocation or retraction of Peter Leon.</p>
      <p>After much, Philipp said: "Fabricius and he himself write everything; do not ask me to change anything..." etc. So the papers almost fail me.</p>
      <p>When I had written the acts of the previous synod to the Clavennians in good faith from the acts themselves, some Italians said I had written the letters of Simon Magus. The devil should have to deal with them; no modesty helps when one does not pull off their caps roughly. As for Dr. Vergerius, I will add this (for I want the truth to have its full testimony) that he did not approve thereafter that Peter Leon would withdraw from his promises. But one must fear, it is as if it is a contrived matter, they promise whatever one wants, for another end. Then when a certain young minister (these things happened before the case of Leon was discussed, undoubtedly to soften me) had disputed about heaven and said among other things that it is not certain about the ascension of Christ into heaven, since where heaven or hell is, is not known to us, and he was accused in the synod in the presence of Dr. Vergerius, but also that this minister did not read Dr. Bullinger's books and spoke contemptuously of them, I congratulated myself on such an opportunity offered, and when I gave my opinion, with Vergerius listening, who was second to me, I said: this is the opinion of Brentius, who now mixes hell with heaven: but by the grace of God we have so far kept our churches free from that error and hope to be able to keep them in the future, etc.</p>
      <p>Dr. Philippus colleague the same and other things more harshly. But when the minister said he thought rightly, but only for the sake of disputing, he was severely reprimanded, indeed remained in the ministry, but so that this was the last admonition. But when Vergerius was also ordered to give his opinion, he very angrily attacked that minister, who would raise such disputes or questions, an unlearned man; that furthermore he had spoken contemptuously of Dr. Bullinger, who is the prince of theologians, he advised that he should be completely excluded from the ministry.</p>
      <p>These things then, so that I bear witness to Vergerius; with what mind he spoke, God knows. And among other things, he also confessed that he agrees with us on the sacrament and in testimony of this, if it seemed to us, he would communicate with us. Finally, when the synod was over, he shook my hand, and in the meantime, when I had asked for the book of Michael Angelus by letter, he replied with this note, which you see attached here. But I will remember your rule, which you prescribe in your last letters.</p>
      <p>See how far I am carried; I fear you may not be able to read, but I could not do otherwise in such turmoil; forgive me. You can communicate this to Dr. Lavater and Dr. Simler; for I know them and who they are; otherwise, if these things go out, I have to fight again with these beasts. But I abhor these fights; but Vergerius saw in another's cause, what he could do in his own, if he tried anything. Now it is certain that traps are set for Vergerius; so I fear he will have to die with us. For I have read a letter, coming from Feldkirch from a good friend; he warns that he has seen with his own eyes some horses, the riders dressed in gray, with their armor and guns, waiting for Vergerius; he also names the places; warns that the bailiff of Sargans is also one who has received the order. This matter was discussed in the senate at Feldkirch.</p>
      <p>There they should also stand two horses at the toll bridge every day with firearms, waiting. (All these things must be kept secret; for the good friend who wrote this from Feldkirch would lose his life and limb, etc.) Therefore, one must now do the best with him; if he follows me, we will make the people tired and perhaps let a cry go out to 14, Vergerius is coming; then they will long for the prey, but in vain. I know well that you have other things to do; but have patience, read the other letters with good will, and sometimes return them with a trusted person. Farewell.</p>
      <p>Chur, the first of June, in the year 1562.</p>
      <p>You know the hand.</p>
