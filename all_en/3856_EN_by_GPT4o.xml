      <p>S. P. Yesterday I just arrived in Piotrków, most esteemed men, where the kingdom's assembly is being held, and I delivered your letters and those of others to both the Bishop of Włocławek, Jakub Uchański, and other counts to whom I had letters from there. Today, finally, the bearer of the present letter, Sebastian, arrived, who said he would soon return to you. Therefore, I did not want to fail to write to you through him, in the short time available to me, a few brief lines about the matters happening here, even though much of my time is taken up by other concerns.</p>
      <p>First, you should know that your letters were very welcome to those to whom you wrote; however, due to the sudden and great occupations, we could not obtain any response for you, but after the assembly is concluded, you will have a response through someone else. Also, know that the assembly has been extended from the feast of Andrew until now, yet nothing has been concluded, and it is now ending due to the fear of the plague, which could easily arise with the resolution, and thus the same assembly is postponed to the feast of Michael. Other matters were discussed than religion, for the king immediately requested from the beginning that the matter of religion be deferred to another time, so that the defense of the kingdom against the Tartars could be diligently addressed now, he requested, and later promised to establish a special session solely on the matter of religion, and this was granted to him.</p>
      <p>When it came to the consultation on defense, the land envoys, as we call them, urged that the king should reclaim from the senators and others his royal properties and prefectures, which were granted against the kingdom's law, and also that the sacred monies, as they call them, which new bishops carry to Rome for the pallium, should not be allowed to be taken out, but placed in the defense of the kingdom, and that he should add some abbeys to this and he would have enough. But the lords senators, especially those who hold royal properties, did not like to hear this, indeed they dared to say to our envoys, who are like instigators. If, they said, you insist, we will conspire against you with the priests, leave this matter. And so somehow they immediately proposed another matter about the election or rather the form of the election of a new king, but even this is hardly yet completed, because it is very difficult, yet I think it will be completed. All other matters were deferred to future assemblies, and the matter of religion itself, which must now be explicitly discussed there, so that it will be free for anyone to bring whomever they wish to a free colloquium. The papal legate was never treated more miserably among us.</p>
      <p>He came here with that Viennese monk Canisius. In Kraków, he was immediately treated excellently upon entry.</p>
      <p>The Bishop of Kraków had summoned a minister of a certain noble, who recently joined us from the papists, in order to show his diligence in eradicating heretics before the legate.</p>
      <p>But this turned into his own disgrace.</p>
      <p>For over a thousand horsemen came to Kraków and then approached the bishop in groups and filled the court and the place where he was sitting with the legate and canons and said many words against him because he summons them to his judgments against their liberties and disturbs peaceful men, he who should pacify. The legate feared something other than words and was amazed in a wonderful way, I think he was never in such terror, for all the tables and benches of that place were filled by the nobles, as it is said, irreverently.</p>
      <p>When the bishop saw where this matter was heading, he preferred to deny and say he knew nothing about this citation and thus was freed from bad words and danger. The preaching of the word of God is now publicly instituted every feast day in Piotrków, to the indignation of all the bishops, and songs were heard in the king's courtyard, yet they were not prohibited. Also, the Bishop of Kraków, when he was harassed by the nobles in the senate because he disturbs them with his citations, etc., then he, when he saw no one to help him in the senate, and the king connives at everything, bent his knees with a certain fury and indignation and swore that he no longer wants to disturb anyone for religion, since he has no helpers and now wants to enjoy his peace, but he provoked laughter with his piety and devotion. Pray to God, most esteemed and pious men, that He alone may rule and defend us against these ravenous wolves, indeed also do not fail us with your advice. We fear that the Bohemian ministers in Greater Poland may cause us trouble, preventing us from being of one confession, even against the will of their elders, who are in Bohemia. Nothing would be more distressing to us than this, but we will now try every stone for concord. The cause of this division is that they do not want to accept their confession amended by us, yet we still hope for better things from them than they promised us at first, and we recognize here the wonderful providence of God in the prolonged cause of religion. For if it had been acted upon now, the Greater Poles would have entirely left us, who ought rightly to follow us. The Lord will turn it for the better, you only pray for us.</p>
      <p>These, most esteemed men, whatever my writings, consider them kindly. For they have indeed arisen from that sincere love, which has grown in me from that sweetest companionship, which I had there with you. May the Lord Jesus keep you happy and safe for a long time.</p>
      <p>Amen.</p>
      <p>In Piotrków, on the 3rd of February, 1559.</p>
      <p>Your most devoted brother Johannes Lusenius, minister of the church in Iwanowice.</p>
      <p>To the most esteemed and pious men, the lords ministers and professors in the city of Zurich, the most revered lords and brothers.</p>
