      <p>S. Yesterday, alas, on that fateful day for us, our people agreed to that formula of the oath established by the people of Glarus, allowing the adversaries, if they wish, to name the saints, while our people swear by God alone. Much was debated on both sides, and the adversarial party barely prevailed. What we have done, you will see from this writing, in which I have collected the essence of what we said to the senate on this matter; we have freed our souls. Many good citizens are indignant that this has been granted to the adversaries again; others downplay the sin. There were even those who claimed that the same had been accepted in Zürich; but I do not believe it until I have learned something certain from you. I fear that we are accumulating great wrath from God upon ourselves, while we play with His holy word and name; I also think that by God's just judgment, while we wish to reconcile the adversaries to us with the disgrace of God in this part, we will make them more our enemies on the other side. As for the house of the Johannites, namely in Buchs, everyone shouts that nothing should be conceded there; thus we have enough spirit for earthly matters, but nothing for God. Against the Genevans, who are also joined to us by the same religion, we are quite fierce, but against the enemies of our faith, we are softer than wax. These things greatly afflict me.</p>
      <p>Moreover, as for this one who brings this to you, he is our Apiarius, the son of Matthias, who has passed away. He brings with him a copy of your Decades. I had written to you about it a few months ago; but you did not respond to it, from which I assumed it seemed advisable to you that I keep it with me, which I had also entirely decided to do, and for that reason, I made no mention of it to you recently. Meanwhile, this Apiarius, who has seen this copy with me several times, recently negotiated with Froschauer in Frankfurt about printing it at Froschauer's expense and, as I hear, has already agreed with him on the condition that he can first agree with me about the copy. Apiarius told me this, asking that I, by remaining quiet, might help his press in this matter. Since I neither wish nor dare to presume anything without your authority, I ask you again to let me know what you think. I am not at all urging the edition; for I know how full the world is of books and what they usually achieve, those who dare to publish something, so I will keep it much more safely with me. I also know how full everything is of slanderers, whose tongues I would gladly avoid. However, if some benefit could return to the church from here in the meantime, I would not want it to be frustrated because of me. What certainly prompted me to translate this work of yours was that I saw the simple and plain doctrine of the gospel being taught with astonishing confusion in the German churches, which I thought could not be better helped than in this way, so that private individuals and laypeople might also have a simple and clear method of sacred religion and in this confusion of things, everyone might be able to consult themselves. Everything is also full of heresies, and Christianity is being divided into innumerable sects, while everyone indeed turns to books, but such ones that entangle their consciences more than they explain them; for I do not know of any work existing in the German language that demonstrates such a certain and clear way through all the heads of religion. The Latins have Calvin's Institutes, the loci of Philipp and Sarcerius, etc. The Germans, besides the loci of Philipp translated by Jonas, have nothing, as far as I know, in which the whole of Christ's religion is so fully taught, except for many and various catechisms, but most of these are so insipid, not to say impure, that it would be more desirable to lack them than to imbue catechumens with such things. Of the same kind are also most of those which cannot be snatched from the hands of our ministers, unless they are helped by such a book. But in this work of yours, you have encompassed the whole of religion so succinctly, clearly, methodically, and simply that among your innumerable laudable writings, none seems to have achieved greater praise, none to have produced greater fruits in the church. Nor do I know whether the doctrine of God can be taught more purely, simply, and fully by anyone than it has been taught here by you.</p>
      <p>I am not the only one who judges this way; but all who acknowledge Christ feel and testify the same. This impelled me to translate it, yet in such a way that I might also help my studies with this translation and progress in the doctrine of piety, which I hope to have achieved through the grace of the Lord, and this will be sufficient reward for this labor for me, even if the book is not published. If, however, some fruit of this labor could also reach others, there is more reason for me to give thanks to the Lord. But I leave this entirely to your judgment. So that you may see the work itself, Apiarius brings it with him. It is a first draft, as you will see; for I did not have so much leisure to write it out, nor did I have another whom I hoped could write it out correctly. It would not be inconvenient if it were printed at Apiarius's; for I could read, inspect, and correct everything and at the same time also compose an index of things. If, therefore, it seems good to you that it be published, I ask only this one thing, that you negotiate with my brother with Froschauer, that he may grant some consideration for my labor, and then some copies to be distributed to friends.</p>
      <p>Whatever you decide there, will be binding for me. And I write this because of Apiarius, so that he can report something certain from there. I will discuss the title and inscription with you later, once you have decided on the edition. Many brothers certainly ask me, who either do not know the Latin language well or do not understand what they read, that I might help them with this labor. Schlatter has also read most of the work, and Witenbach has read part of it, and they urge that it be published. But it is the same to me, whether it is published or not; therefore, I freely submit it to your judgment, so that you may also freely decide about it. These are the things for the present. May the Lord keep you safe for us for a long time! All greet you and yours. Musculus, at the request of your people, has received four students into his fellowship, for which he wishes Ammianus to thank him. Farewell. Bern, October 12, 1555.</p>
      <p>Your Haller.</p>
      <p>To the most illustrious man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, the most faithful pastor of the church of Zürich, his lord, compatriot, dearest and most esteemed Mr. Heinrich Bullinger.</p>
      <p>Pündtschweren 1555.</p>
