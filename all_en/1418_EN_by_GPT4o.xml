      <p>S. D. I received your letter from September 20th, as well as the previous ones, in good faith and I thank you greatly for your loyalty and diligence; for I understand well that you write from your bed; but with Satan raging, it is indeed better to converse often. I have written that I know nothing about the council, but I have said that I have nothing from Trent; for I am expecting letters from good men at any moment, from which I will learn what the blessed fathers are doing. Otherwise, I am not unaware that they are now sweating and laboring strenuously to suppress the truth, especially since they seem to have the most powerful Charles as their protector. But cursed is he who trusts in man and makes flesh his strength. Our people left for the assembly yesterday; rumors have spread that the people of Bern will not come. What will happen, I do not know; many think that the assembly was convened for no other reason than to drag our people and yours into the agreement and subjection of the council. I hope that if they demand this, they will lose their effort and expense. If they are doing this, they are doing everything according to the advice of the Pope and the Emperor, who will try to set the Swiss against each other, so that in the meantime he can more easily overcome the French, and then destroy all of Switzerland. All the man's plans are aimed at this; but many do not want to see it, blinded partly by envy, partly by greed; they fill the measure.</p>
      <p>May the merciful Lord graciously deign to look upon us who trust in Him and overthrow the plans of the wicked. You undoubtedly know that the French have occupied 4 cities in Piedmont, many fortresses, and extended their domain by 15 Italian miles; in this way, they have diverted the Emperor's army from Parma.</p>
      <p>Meanwhile, it is said that open war has been declared between the Emperor and the King; thus, perhaps the outcome of the council will be less favorable; the plans of many will perhaps become entangled. Let us remain steadfast in the Lord, let us pray, let us be vigilant. May the Lord Jesus restore you to health. We have no command for the day other than to resolve. Farewell forever. Zurich, September 29, 1551.</p>
      <p>Your Bullinger.</p>
      <p>To the most distinguished man, Mr. Oswald Myconius, my venerable lord and dearest brother.</p>
      <p>Basel.</p>
