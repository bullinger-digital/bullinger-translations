    <p xml:id="regest1">Recommends Stephan [...], who has been declared leprous in Konstanz and has already been supported by the people of Zurich with a donation. Guild master [Ulrich von Wengi], who sent him for a spa treatment, doubts the diagnosis as do various medical experts in Schaffhausen, Metz, and Mulhouse. Despite the successful treatment, the responsible health inspectors still adhere to their judgment. Zwick therefore asks to help the man get a reassessment in Zurich or elsewhere in the Confederation. His wife is in the same situation. Zwick would like to know again how much the people of Zurich have donated. Inquires about Bullinger's opinion on Bucer's pastoral writing, but warns against a public expression of opinion. Greetings.</p>

      <p>The grace of God be with you.</p>
      <p>Dear sir and brother, the bearer of this letter is the good man who has been recognized by our people as leprous and to whom you have also sent a donation here, which I have also shared with him. But so that you know why he is now coming to you, his situation is as follows: Firstly, he has been suspected of leprosy by some, which he had to have examined. Secondly, he has been examined by our people, that is, by the lepers, and thus recognized as leprous; however, it is our custom that only the lepers examine. When they recognized that he was leprous, we had a very skilled barber and guild master; he told us he did not consider him guilty, as it was a rash from a cold; he should go to a bath, and his condition would certainly improve. This has happened. Thirdly, when he went there, he came to a Jew in Schaffhausen, also to the examiner there, also to the examiner from Metz, and also to the surgeon from Mulhouse. They all said that they found nothing of leprosy on him. The good man Stephanus says that these have examined him much more diligently than the lepers with us.</p>
      <p>When he was in the bath and came back to us and reported everything, and also became completely smooth on the body and the rash completely disappeared, we decided that he should be further examined. Thus, it was ordered by our lords that two doctors and two of the foremost examiners should examine him. They did so and tested him thoroughly from the outside and inside through the blood and otherwise, and unanimously said that they found no leprosy on him at all.</p>
      <p>Based on this, our lords decided that he should be examined again by the lepers; however, they appointed someone to admonish them to examine diligently and earnestly. When they examined him again, they again recognized him as leprous. Thus, it must remain with us as it is with the examination, for they have their customs and rights; the lepers will not be driven away from them.</p>
      <p>Since the matter remains in doubt and some say white, others black, it seemed good to him, and also to some of us, that he should perhaps have himself examined elsewhere. So, if you know of a place with you or elsewhere or two places in the Confederation where examinations are conducted, my request to you for love's sake is that you be helpful and advise him there. For this, the Lord God will give you the reward.</p>
      <p>This is what I wanted to write to you on behalf of the good man. Dated Konstanz, June 26, 1538.</p>
      <p>Yours, Johannes Zwick.</p>
      <p>As it went with Stephanus, so it also went with the woman.</p>
      <p>Also, I have collected all kinds of alms and put everything in a bag and have become confused in it, so that I do not know for sure what I have received from everyone; I ask you to let me know how much you have sent me.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, there is nothing that I should write. The matter of concord rests by the grace of the Lord. What will follow, I do not know. You know, however, if I am not mistaken, the booklet published by Bucer on pastoral care. If only I could obtain your judgment! But be careful not to recommend or criticize anything to anyone, lest the same thing happen to you as with the booklet to the Monasterians.</p>
      <p>Farewell a thousand times with the whole house and brothers. I could not write to Pellican, but I wish him well with Leo and the other good ones. Again and again, farewell.</p>
      <p>To the most honorable man, Mr. Heinrich Bullinger, my esteemed lord and brother.</p>
